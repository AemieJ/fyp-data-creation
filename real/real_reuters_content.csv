Taliban fire in air to scatter hundreds of protesters in Kabul,5504,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - Taliban gunmen fired in the air on Tuesday to scatter protesters in the Afghan capital Kabul, witnesses said, as video showed scores scurrying to escape volleys of gunfire. Hundreds of men and women shouting slogans such as ""Long live the resistance"" and ""Death to Pakistan"" marched in the streets to protest against the Taliban takeover. Neighbouring Pakistan has deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of assisting the Islamist group's return to power - charges it denies. ""The Islamic government is shooting at our poor people,"" one panic-stricken woman on the street says over sounds of gunfire in a video clip shown on Iranian television news. There were no immediate reports of injuries, however. The Taliban's rapid advance across Afghanistan as U.S. forces pulled out last month triggered a scramble to leave by people fearing reprisals. U.S.-led foreign forces evacuated about 124,000 foreigners and at-risk Afghans, but tens of thousands were left behind. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was in contact with about 100 Americans who were still in Afghanistan. About 1,000 people, including Americans, have been stuck in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif for days awaiting clearance for charter flights to leave, an organiser told Reuters, blaming the delay on the U.S. State Department. Blinken, holding talks in Qatar, a key interlocutor with the Taliban, said the problem was one of documents. ""My understanding is that the Taliban have not denied exit to anyone holding a valid document, but they have said those without valid documents, at this point, can't leave,"" he told reporters. read more ""Because all of these people are grouped together, that's meant that flights have not been allowed to go ... We are not aware of anyone being held on an aircraft, or any hostage-like situation."" AIRPORT RESTART At the same news conference, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said no deal had yet been reached with the Taliban on how Qatar and its partner Turkey could get Kabul airport running again. ""We hope in the next few days we can get to a level where the airport is up and running for passengers and for humanitarian aid as well,"" he said. Turkey says it wants to provide security inside the airport to protect any Turkish staff and safeguard operations, but that the Taliban have insisted no foreign forces can be present. read more On Monday, the Islamist militants claimed victory in the Panjshir valley, the last province holding out against it, and promised to name a government soon. A woman chants from inside of a car during the anti-Pakistan protest in Kabul, Afghanistan, September 7, 2021. WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the Panjshir governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), commanded by Panjshiri leader Ahmad Massoud. Massoud denied that his force, consisting of remnants of the Afghan army as well as local militia fighters, was beaten. ""We are in Panjshir and our resistance will continue,"" he tweeted. He said he was safe but did not say where. The Taliban have repeatedly sought to reassure Afghans and foreign countries that they will not return to the brutality of their last reign two decades ago, marked by violent public punishments and the barring of women and girls from public life. But more than three weeks after seizing Kabul, they have yet to set out their plans. Asked whether Washington would recognise the Taliban, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday: ""That’s a long way off."" STUDENTS SEGREGATED Teachers and students at universities in Afghanistan's largest cities - Kabul, Kandahar and Herat - told Reuters that female students were being segregated in class with curtains, taught separately or limited to some campus areas. ""Putting up curtains is not acceptable,"" Anjila, a 21-year-old female student at Kabul University, said by telephone, adding that women had sat apart from males in classrooms before the Taliban took over, but without barriers. read more ""I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago."" The conflict in Afghanistan, coupled with drought and coronavirus, has left 18 million people - almost half the population - in need of humanitarian aid, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said. It said tens of thousands of families had headed for relief camps in urban areas, but found they had neither food nor income. read more ""Basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing and food and other lifesaving aid is about to run out,"" Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a news conference in Geneva, urging more aid ahead of an international donor conference on Sept. 13. read more The World Health Organisation is liaising with Qatar on deliveries of urgently needed medical supplies, WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said. Drought and war have forced about 5.5 million Afghans to flee their homes, including more than 550,000 newly displaced in 2021, the International Organization for Migration says. Western powers say they are prepared to send humanitarian aid, but that broader economic engagement depends on the shape and actions of the Taliban government.

UK PM Johnson raises taxes to tackle health and social care crisis,4880,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out plans on Tuesday to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors to try to fix a health and social care funding crisis, angering some in his governing party by breaking an election promise. After spending huge amounts of money to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson is returning to an election pledge to address Britain's creaking social care system, where costs are projected to double as the population ages over the next two decades. He also moved to try to tackle a backlog in Britain's health system, which has seen millions waiting months for treatment from the state-run National Health Service, after resources were refocused to deal with COVID-19. ""It would be wrong for me to say that we can pay for this recovery without taking the difficult but responsible decisions about how we finance it,"" Johnson told parliament. ""It would be irresponsible to meet the costs from higher borrowing and higher debt,"" he said, outlining increases that broke a promise made in his Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto not to raise such levies to fund social care. British politicians have tried for years to find a way to pay for social care, though successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers have ducked the issue because they feared it would anger voters and their own parties. Ignoring disquiet in his party, Johnson outlined what he described as a new health and social care levy that will see the rate of National Insurance payroll taxes paid by both workers and employers rise by 1.25 percentage points, with the same increase also applied to the tax on shareholder dividends. read more He said the increases would raise 36 billion pounds ($50 billion) over three years. The pound fell against the euro and dollar after the announced measures, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies said would increase Britain's tax burden to 35% of GDP - a peacetime record. Johnson has tried to cool anger within his party, which has for decades positioned itself as a defender of low taxes, over the hikes, which some lawmakers fear could lose them support at an election due in 2024. Parliament will debate the measures further on Wednesday. MANIFESTO BREAKING Johnson explained that elderly Britons would no longer face crippling care costs that have forced many to sell their homes, and said he could not have predicted the coronavirus pandemic which has further stretched services. ""You can't fix health and social care without long-term reform. The plan I'm setting out today will fix all of those problems together,"" he said, to jeers and laughter from opposition Labour Party lawmakers. ""I accept that this breaks a manifesto commitment which is not something I do lightly, but a global pandemic was in no one's manifesto."" Shortly afterwards, his work and pensions minister, Therese Coffey, said Britain would not raise state retirement pensions in line with earnings next year, breaking another election commitment to maintain the so-called ""triple lock"". read more Labour leader Keir Starmer was quick to pounce on Conservative fears. ""This is a tax rise that breaks a promise that the prime minister made at the last election ... Read my lips, the Tories (Conservatives) can never again claim to be the party of low tax,"" Starmer said. Some British businesses said the rise in national insurance would only compound damage done to firms by the pandemic. read more ""This rise will impact the wider economic recovery by landing significant costs on firms when they are already facing a raft of new cost pressures and dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery,"" said Suren  Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Trade body Make UK said the move might put jobs at risk just as pandemic job support programmes end. ""Putting a tax on jobs and workers at a time when Government is pulling the furlough scheme is ill-timed as well as illogical,"" its chief executive Stephen Phipson said. Like many Western leaders, Johnson is facing demands to spend more on welfare even though government borrowing has ballooned to 14.2% of economic output - a level last seen at the end of World War Two. For Johnson, who helped win the 2016 Brexit vote and then as prime minister presided over Britain's exit from the European Union, fixing social care for the elderly and disabled ""once and for all"" offers a possible way to broaden his domestic legacy. In 2019, Johnson said he had a social care plan. Two years later, his proposals are a gamble. Critics say Johnson is expanding state spending again without any clear reform of the way social care is administered, and that the rise in National Insurance payments will disproportionately hit the young people and lower paid workers. read more ($1 = 0.7261 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
World's top three Christian leaders in climate appeal ahead of U.N. summit,2885,"VATICAN CITY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The world's three main Christian leaders issued an unprecedented joint appeal to members of their Churches to ""listen to the cry of the earth"" and back action to stem the effects of climate change. In ""A Joint Message for the Protection of Creation,"" Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew asked Christians to pray that world leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November make courageous choices. ""We call on everyone, whatever their belief or world view, to endeavour to listen to the cry of the earth and of people who are poor, examining their behaviour and pledging meaningful sacrifices for the sake of the earth which God has given us,"" the message said. Francis heads the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, Bartholomew is the spiritual leader of the world's some 220 million Orthodox Christians and Welby is the senior bishop of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which has about 85 million members. All three have been very active in environmental affairs and concur that climate change and global warming is at least partially caused by human activities such as the use of fossil fuels. ""We stand before a harsh justice: biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and climate change are the inevitable consequences of our actions, since we have greedily consumed more of the earth’s resources than the planet can endure,"" the message said. It said recent extreme weather events, natural disasters, floods, fires, droughts and rising sea levels have shown that ""climate change is not only a future challenge, but an immediate and urgent matter of survival."" Europe had its warmest summer on record this year, though only by a small margin over two previous highest temperatures for June-August, European Union scientists said earlier on Tuesday, and green groups have called for the COP26 conference to be postponed. read more Typically delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, yet with many countries grappling with COVID-19 and poorer nations struggling to access vaccines, it should be delayed, the Climate Action Network (CAN) said. Scotland's bishops have said Pope Francis, who underwent intestinal surgery in July, will take part in the Glasgow conference, health permitting. read more A spokeswoman for Welby said he would attend. Bartholomew's office did not immediately respond to an email about his plans. On Oct. 4, the Vatican will host a major gathering of world religious leaders and scientists to take a common stand to raise the stakes ahead of the Glasgow conference. Called ""Faith and Science: Towards COP26,"" is being organised by Britain and Italy. It will bring together some 40 leaders from the world's major religions and 10 scientists.

Canada's Trudeau hit by gravel on campaign trail dogged by anti-vax hecklers,2831,"OTTAWA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hit by a handful of gravel on Monday, television images show, as he made his way to his campaign bus past a crowd shouting their opposition to COVID-19 vaccines. A CTV camera captured what looks to be white gravel hitting Trudeau and one of his bodyguards as he walked toward his campaign bus in London, Ontario. The Liberals canceled an event late last month because of safety concerns linked to anti-vax protesters. Trudeau played down the incident on his plane later, saying he may have been hit on the shoulder, and once he had pumpkin seeds thrown at him, according to a video posted on Twitter by Global News TV reporter Abigail Bimman. Earlier on Monday, Trudeau assailed Conservative leader Erin O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates, including for his own candidates, and called the hecklers ""angry mobs"" of anti-vaxxers. ""Erin O'Toole is at least taking some of his cues from (the anti-vax crowd),"" Trudeau said. Around 74% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, but a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic is currently building, mostly among the unvaccinated. Trudeau, 49, also criticised O'Toole on Monday for waffling on gun control as the campaign enters its final stretch ahead of the Sept. 20 election, with the Liberals and Conservatives running virtually neck-and-neck in the polls. O'Toole on Sunday scrapped a campaign promise to eliminate a ban on some assault weapons, a sensitive issue in Canada after several mass shootings in recent years. Trudeau sought to capitalize on his opponent's shift with just two weeks left to reverse his fortunes. read more O'Toole ""will say anything to try and get elected,"" Trudeau told supporters at a campaign event in southern Ontario, Canada's most populous province. ""That's not leadership. That's not integrity."" Speaking in Ottawa, O'Toole refused to say how many of his candidates had not been inoculated. He has said those who are not vaccinated must be tested daily. ""Our approach, with respect to vaccinations, is we try and encourage and inform and work with people, but we will respect their personal health decisions,"" O'Toole said. Liberal strategists have said the crucial period of the campaign starts after Labor Day, because Canadians have been more focused until now on their summer vacations than the election. There are two debates this week, one in French and one in English, the only occasions left in which all the candidates will face one another on national television ahead of the vote. A rolling Nanos Research survey of 1,200 people for CTV on Monday put the Liberals at 34.1% and the Conservatives at 32%, a reversal from a day earlier, when Liberals were at 33.4% compared with 34.9% for Conservatives.

UK employers say Johnson's tax hike will cost jobs,2337,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British business organisations criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to increase taxes to pay for health and social care reform, saying they added to the burden on firms struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would cost jobs. Johnson set out plans on Tuesday to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors. read more The announcement received a cool reception from businesses, who were asked to pay a 1.25 percentage-point increase to a payroll tax known as National Insurance (NI). ""Businesses strongly oppose a rise in national insurance contributions as it will be a drag anchor on jobs growth at an absolutely crucial time,"" Suren  Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said. ""This rise will impact the wider economic recovery by landing significant costs on firms when they are already facing a raft of new cost pressures and dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery."" But the government said it was right that businesses should make a contribution given that they benefit from the health and social care system via their employees. Big businesses would bear the largest burden of the tax rise, Johnson said. A government document published alongside the announcement said 70% of the money raised from businesses will come from the largest 1% of companies and around 40% of businesses would not be affected at all by the levy. ""Those earning more pay more and larger businesses also contribute,"" Sunak said on Twitter. The tax increases also included a 1.25 percentage point rise in dividend tax rates which stands to affect business owners and investors who rely on dividend income. Manufacturers' group Make UK said the measures would hinder Britain's recovery from its worst economic slump in more than 300 years in 2020. ""Economic history tells us that job cuts are most likely when the economy starts to open again after a downturn because firms need the capital to reset,"" said Chief Executive Stephen Phipson. ""After witnessing large-scale redundancies at the height of the pandemic and the plug being pulled on the furlough scheme, government should be putting in place measures to protect jobs and incentivise recruitment. An increase to NI would have the opposite effect"". Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Sweden to remove most remaining pandemic restrictions this month,1809,"STOCKHOLM, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Sweden will push ahead with easing COVID-19 restrictions at the end of this month, removing most curbs and limits on public venues such as restaurants, theatres and stadiums, the government said on Tuesday. With most adults vaccinated, Sweden has gradually eased some restrictions during a summer lull in the pandemic. While it has seen infections mount in recent weeks amid the rapid spread of the more contagious Delta variant, deaths from the disease have remained low. Sweden has been an outlier in aspects of its handling of the disease, shunning hard lockdowns throughout the pandemic and relying heavily on voluntary recommendations regarding issues such as social distancing and hygiene. However, public gatherings such as concerts, sporting events and venues such as bars and restaurants have operated under tight crowd limits, curbs that are now set to be removed on Sept. 29, along with a recommendation to work from home. ""The important message is that we now take further steps in the return to normal everyday life,"" Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. ""Our view has all the time been that restrictions should be lifted as soon as possible."" Hallengren said the government was also looking into the possible use of vaccination certificates for some activities, though it hoped these would not be necessary to impose in a country with a long history of high vaccination rates. About 70% of Swedes aged 16 and above are fully vaccinated. Sweden has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, which opted for tighter curbs during the initial waves of the pandemic, but less than many larger European countries that employed hard lockdowns.

Factbox: Global big banks plot back-to-office plans as vaccines roll out,5516,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - The biggest banks in the world plan to reopen their offices, emboldened by aggressive vaccination drives and falling COVID-19 cases in major financial hubs, after sending most employees home early last year to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The COVID-19 Delta variant's spread is prompting some firms to rethink their back-to-office plans, but many of Wall Street's biggest banks are sticking to their decision to bring back employees. Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions: UNITED STATES Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) The bank has pushed back its U.S. return-to-office date to Oct. 18. read more Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June. read more JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) The largest U.S. bank has brought back employees in the United States to the office on a rotational basis from July.

NatWest (NWG.L) CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate. The bank will adopt its new ways of working over the summer, with the majority of staff in England and Wales expected to be back in the office from September, dependent on government and public health advice, a spokesperson said. GERMANY Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) Deutsche Bank in London had plans to bring more staff back from June 21, assuming the city's lockdown restrictions were loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Germany's largest lender has also told its U.S. investment bankers that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.

"Squeaking, hairless and pink: twin giant pandas born at Madrid Zoo",1089,"MADRID, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Twin giant panda cubs were born at Madrid's zoo on Monday in a boost to conservation efforts for the vulnerable species, whose numbers have been rebounding thanks to an international captive breeding programme. The pair, whose sex is yet to be determined, are the fifth and sixth cubs of Madrid's female panda Hua Zui Ba and her partner Bing Xing, the zoo said. After four hours of labour, the first cub was born around 8:30 a.m., while the second followed four hours later in what the zoo described as a ""peaceful"" birth. Two technicians from China's Chengdu panda breeding base will assist local veterinarians in checking the health of the pink, hairless newborns, who will be totally dependent on their mother for the first four months of their life. In July, Chinese conservationists announced they no longer considered pandas to be an endangered species, upgrading their status a notch to vulnerable.

Planned Parenthood wins restraining order against Texas anti-abortion group,2170,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred an anti-abortion group from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce a near-total ban on abortion in the state, handing the nation's largest abortion provider a small victory in the bitter legal fight. Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Planned Parenthood a temporary restraining order against the anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, blocking the group and its allies from using an unusual mechanism of the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices are closer than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected. Guerra Gamble said in her three-page written order that allowing the so-called private enforcement mechanism to go forward while Planned Parenthood took further legal action would cause ""probable, irreparable and imminent injury"" that could not be cured later. The unusual enforcement mechanism gives the civil enforcement power to any party in or out of Texas who chooses to sue, while preventing government officials from enforcing the ban. The Travis County restraining order does not bar others from using the law against Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers in Texas. A hearing on a possible further injunction was set for Sept. 13. Helene Krasnoff, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president for public policy litigation and law, expressed relief ""that the Travis County district court has acted quickly to grant this restraining order against Texas Right to Life and anyone working with them as deputized enforcers of this draconian law."" ""But make no mistake: this is not enough relief for Texas,"" she said. Elizabeth Graham, a Texas Right to Life vice president, said in a statement that her group ""will never back down from protecting pregnant women and preborn children from abortion.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Theranos founder's defense may turn on state of mind, experts say",4423,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - As Elizabeth Holmes' fraud trial gets underway this week, lawyers for the former Silicon Valley entrepreneur may try to show she was a true believer in the blood-testing technology at her startup Theranos Inc, and never intended to defraud investors and patients, legal experts said. On Wednesday, federal jurors in San Jose, California will hear opening arguments in the case against the Stanford University dropout who once dazzled Silicon Valley and is now charged with misleading investors and patients by falsely claiming that the company's printer-sized devices could run a range of tests and produce accurate results using a single drop of blood. To defeat the charges, Holmes' attorneys are likely to home in on what she herself believed about the complex science, according to several defense attorneys. ""The best way to argue a defense in a science-based case is to suggest that this young woman had a good faith belief that this science was real,"" said defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman, who is not involved in the case. Holmes, 37, founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19, and prosecutors allege she told the company's private investors several lies, including that Theranos did not need U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its devices. Holmes is also accused of having defrauded patients by leading them to think blood tests from Theranos machines were more accurate than they were. The most serious charges of wire fraud require prosecutors to prove Holmes acted with intent to defraud. To be convicted, the jury of twelve must unanimously find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In court filings, Holmes' attorneys have argued there is a missing link between what Holmes herself knew and what Theranos employees told doctors and regulators about the company's technology. ""Corporate executives generally do not face individual criminal liability for the actions and statements of a corporation's agents or employees, and that principle holds equally true in this case,"" they wrote. Holmes' lawyers said last year that she was ""highly likely"" to take the stand in her own defense, a move that experts called risky. It could backfire if jurors do not view her as credible and give prosecutors latitude to bring in a broader range of evidence, they said. Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes leaves after a hearing at a federal court in San Jose, California, July 17, U.S., 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam Brafman said that distancing Holmes from testimony about patients who were adversely affected by the company's claims will be crucial if she is to be acquitted. Where there is no doubt about a fact such as an inaccurate test result, Brafman said the defense should ""take it on the chin"" and bring jurors back to questioning what Holmes knew. ""You pick battles in a trial that you have a chance of winning. The best way to confront really horrifying testimony is to not make the trial about that,"" Brafman said. JURORS' SYMPATHY Filings unsealed on the eve of trial showed that Holmes may also invoke allegations of sexual and psychological abuse by her former romantic partner, ex-Theranos executive Sunny ""Ramesh"" Balwani, as part of her defense. Holmes told a psychologist that Balwani was controlling, ""monitoring her calls, text messages, and emails; physical violence, such as throwing hard, sharp objects at her; restricting her sleep,"" according to a filing from February 2020 by Balwani's lawyers, who said the allegations required separate trials. Balwani, who has denied the allegations, is scheduled to be tried separately next year. His attorney did not respond to request for comment. Holmes' attorneys said her ""deference"" to Balwani shaped what she believed about financial models he created, and about the Theranos-Walgreens partnership he led, which prosecutors say the pair oversold to investors. Amanda Kramer, a former prosecutor in New York who has handled both securities fraud and sex trafficking cases, said that regardless of whether jurors are convinced that evidence of alleged abuse adds up to a defense, hearing such testimony ""could garner sympathy for Elizabeth Holmes, and that is not a small thing at all."" ""Because no matter their duty, that is going to influence the way they hear the evidence, and ultimately the way they deliberate and cast their votes at the end of the trial,"" she said.

Factbox: How does the UK government plan to pay for health and social care?,3196,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday set out plans to raise taxes on workers, companies and some shareholders by 12 billion pounds ($16.5 billion) a year to try to tackle a backlog in the health system and fix how Britain's adult social care is funded. read more Below are the details of the government's plans: HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE LEVY From April 2022 the government will introduce new 1.25% levies on both earned income and on employers' wage bills to raise funds for health and social care. The levy will be based on National Insurance contributions and will be paid by working adults including - from 2023 - those over state pension age. NATIONAL INSURANCE RISE In order to bring the money in as quickly as possible, for the first year the levy will be raised via a temporary hike in National Insurance social security contributions, and then from April 2023 it will become a separate levy. The rates of National Insurance contributions will increase by 1.25 percentage points for both employers and employees until April 2023, when it will revert back to its existing level. National Insurance is not paid by people who are over pension age but still working. The government said that in 2022-23, a typical basic rate taxpayer earning the median basic-rate taxpayer's income of 24,100 pounds would pay an extra 180 pounds in National Insurance, while a typical higher-rate taxpayer earning the median higher rate taxpayer’s income of 67,100 pounds would be expected to pay an extra 715 pounds. DIVIDEND TAX RISE From April 2022 the government will also raise by 1.25 percentage points the rate of tax paid by individuals who receive dividend income from shares. Shares held in tax-exempt savings accounts known as ISAs are not subject to dividend tax. Due to a 2,000 pound tax-free allowance for dividend income, around 60% of people with dividend income outside of ISAs would not be affected, the government said. HOW MUCH MONEY WILL IT RAISE? The government said the new measures would raise around 36 billion pounds over the next three years, of which 5.4 billion pounds would be invested in adult social care. Of the 12 billion pounds on average raised per year, the government said around 11.4 billion pounds would come from the levy and around 0.6 billion pounds from the increase to dividend tax rates. The government said Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would receive an extra 2.2 billion pounds each year on average as a result of the health and social care package. HOW MUCH WILL PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TOWARDS THEIR CARE? Previously people were not eligible for help with the cost of care if they had savings worth more than 23,250 pounds. Under the new plans, from October 2023 anyone with assets under 20,000 pounds will have their care costs fully covered by the state. Those with between 20,000 and 100,000 pounds of assets will have to contribute towards the cost of their care but will also receive means-tested state support on a tapered basis. The government said no one would have to pay more than 86,000 pounds towards the cost of their care over their lifetime. ($1 = 0.7256 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pound extends day's losses after UK announces tax hikes,2735,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The pound dipped for a second consecutive day against a broadly stronger dollar on Tuesday and hit its lowest in over six weeks against the euro, with most of the currency's losses coming after the British government set out a plan to raise taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out plans to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors to try to fix the health and social care system, angering some in his governing party by breaking an election promise. read more Johnson outlined what he described as a new health and social care levy, which will see the rate of National Insurance payroll taxes paid by workers and employers rise by 1.25 percentage points. The same increase will be applied to the tax on shareholder dividends. Sterling, already trading lower on the day, dropped as much as 0.5% against the dollar to $1.3768. It fell to its lowest against the euro since July 21, down 0.2% at 86.14 pence. ""We are seeing the narrative of the (economic) recovery process being tested by a tax hike which potentially could take liquidity or money out of the system, so that news flow isn't particularly helpful,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC World Markets. ""Whenever you do get signs of political friction then invariably that does result in a degree of susceptibility to downside for cable,"" Stretch added. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Michael Saunders did not have a sizeable impact on the pound. Saunders said the central bank may need to raise interest rates next year if growth continues and inflation becomes stickier. read more ""I would assume that the market sees Saunders as an outlier on the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), thus feels no need to reprice hawkishly based on what he's said,"" said Michael Brown, senior market analyst at Caxton FX. Bets that Britain's rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations would lead to a faster economic reopening and rebound had earlier propelled sterling to one of the best performing G10 currencies this year. But recent surveys have hardened indications of slowing economic growth, after a strong rebound triggered by the country's rapid vaccine rollout earlier in the year. They also reveal that economic momentum is stuttering under the impact of Brexit, global supply chain issues and COVID-19 isolation rules. On Monday, sterling dipped on the back of a survey of purchasing managers that showed the UK construction industry grew last month at its weakest pace since the lockdown of early 2021, hit by a severe shortage of building supplies. read more Friday PMI data had showed growth in the services sector slowed down in August compared with July. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK's Sunak to set out spending and budget plans on Oct. 27,1109,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak will deliver a three-year spending review and a budget plan on Oct. 27 as he tries to reconcile demand for more spending on health and other services with his promise to fix the pandemic hit to the public finances. The finance ministry said Sunak would outline his plans alongside Britain's latest official economic forecasts. Including extra funding for health and social care announced earlier on Tuesday, core day-to-day spending, adjusted for inflation, would grow by nearly 4% per year over the course of the current, five-year parliament, the ministry said. This represented the largest real-terms increase in spending of any parliament since 2001, it added. Sunak said his Spending Review plan would keep the public finances on a sustainable path and did not envisage higher spending than announced so far. Government departments would have to identify cuts of at least 5% from day-to-day budgets in order to free up funds for reinvestment in priority areas, the finance ministry said.

Vaccine makers should supply shots for trials to help spur sector -CEPI,2646,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccine makers ought to make their approved shots available for trials or risk hobbling the development of more vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said on Tuesday. Major vaccine studies have so far examined COVID-19 infection rates comparing the prospective vaccine with a placebo. But such trials may no longer be considered ethical in countries where an effective vaccine is widely available. Instead, new vaccines would need to be tested in comparison to an established shot, said CEPI, which was launched in 2017 to fund epidemic vaccine development and is funded by countries as well as by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. read more ""Lack of access to comparator vaccines is already stalling the development of promising vaccine candidates, and the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccine development and supply is huge,"" Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI, said in a statement, a version of which waspublished as a letter to the editors of scientific journal Nature. Established vaccines have been sold under supply contracts that do not foresee use in clinical trials, according to CEPI. ""Thus far, vaccine manufacturers have been reluctant to change this arrangement, threatening to bring vital COVID-19 vaccine R&D to a standstill,"" CEPI's Saville said. An exception appears to be AstraZeneca, whose shot developed along with Oxford University has been obtained as a comparator for planned or ongoing trials, including by Italy's ReiThera Srl, Valneva (VLS.PA) of France, Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics (6547.TWO) and South Korea's SK Bioscience (302440.KS). When asked to comment on the CEPI remarks, AstraZeneca said it ""continues to collaborate with the industry and share resources to tackle the pandemic"". A Valneva spokesperson said the trial was recruited quickly and she was not aware of difficulties in procuring the AstraZeneca doses. The other main Western COVID-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE), Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) - did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CEPI's U.S. director, Nicole Lurie, told Reuters that companies selling approved vaccines are not motivated to assist trials that could lead to the development of a competing product. Countries should renegotiate contracts with manufacturers to let them use doses in trials, she said. Volumes in the tens of thousands of doses would make a huge difference for trials, small compared to the hundreds of millions being delivered, she added.

Filibuster imperils Pelosi's abortion bill in U.S. Senate - Klobuchar,2136,"WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's filibuster rule likely imperils a bill intended to protect abortion rights that Democrats are readying following the Supreme Court's decision not to block a strict new Texas ban, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday. Senator Amy Klobuchar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that some Senate Republicans support abortion rights but not enough to overcome the chamber's rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. The nation's 6-3 conservative top court this week allowed Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect, which observers said showed the justices may be ready to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national right to abortion. That decision led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that the Democratic-controlled chamber will soon debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping similar state anti-abortion regulations. But Klobuchar said that bill faces little to no chance of passing the Senate. ""My solution to this ... I believe we should abolish the filibuster,"" Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Rules Committee, told CNN. ""I do not believe an archaic rule should be used to allow us to put our heads in the sand ... and not take action on these important issues ... We just will get nowhere if we keep this filibuster in place."" Progressive Democrats have repeatedly over the past year suggested doing away with the filibuster to allow other Democratic priorities to pass, including a voting rights bill intended to counteract a wave of new voting restrictions passed by Republican-governed states. Senate moderates, including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have rejected that idea, however. Klobuchar said one way to discourage the frequency of filibusters would be to make senators who object to ending debate actually stay on the floor debating. This ""talking filibuster"" was the tradition until the 1970s. She said another approach would be a ""carveout"" that would only change the filibuster for legislation directly tied to one subject, such as abortion rights.

Court orders Alaska agency to examine Hilcorp pipeline leak,2265,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Alaska regulators must probe a Hilcorp Energy Company pipeline that has repeatedly leaked natural gas into Cook Inlet, the state Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The court said the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission improperly rejected a petition for a hearing on a leak that lasted for several months in 2017. The AOGCC, which regulates oil and gas production, provided “no supporting evidence” to back its claim that it lacked jurisdiction over the 2017 pipeline leak, the court said. “The Commission’s statements about having investigated whether the leak was waste are wholly unsupported,” the decision said. The petition for the hearing was submitted in 2019 by Hollis French, a former AOGCC commissioner who argued that the body had failed to fulfill its duties. “The agency seemed eager to shuck its responsibilities and the Supreme Court corrected that,” French said on Friday after the ruling. Cook Inlet, Alaska’s oldest producing oil basin, hit peak production three decades ago, averaging 219,000 barrels per day in 1971, according to the state. Oil production there is now between 11,000 and 12,000 barrels per day, according to the department. The pipeline supplies natural gas that powers operations at two of Hilcorp’s offshore oil platforms. The leak in question was discovered at the end of 2016, but it was not repaired until the spring of 2017. That pipeline has had several leaks over the years. In April, it leaked gas for the fifth time since 2014, prompting Hilcorp to temporarily shut down production at the platforms. After the most recent leak, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) ordered Hilcorp to replace the entire seven-mile pipeline section within a year. PHMSA also ordered Hilcorp to take several shorter-term correction actions in the interim. Grace Salazar, a spokeswoman for the AOGCC, said by email that the agency is reviewing the court decision to determine the next steps."
"Sergeant Bee, immortalized in Afghanistan photo, reflects on war's legacy",8938,"JACKSONVILLE, N.C., Sept 7 (Reuters) - Today, on a leafy cul-de-sac in North Carolina, his hair is streaked with gray, and he wears his beard long. But on that day 13 years ago, as he sat tucked behind a mud wall in Afghanistan, his head was close-cropped, bare and vulnerable. Retired U.S. Marine Sgt. Billy Bee is sharing a smoke with Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic on the deck of Bee's home. The smoke hangs in the humid, still air, just as it did on May 18, 2008, when their lives were stitched together in a single moment of explosive violence and unlikely survival. They are two men united by war, coming together again as the messy and tragic American involvement in Afghanistan finally was coming to an end, 20 years after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., set it all in motion. Both men remember that 2008 day as being blisteringly hot and humid. Tomasevic was in his underwear and boots, fiddling with a new lens, snapping shots of Bee near Garmsir, in Helmand province, as they talked and smoked. When shots came from a nearby hut, just beyond the wall, Tomasevic rushed into a nearby building inside the compound and grabbed some clothes, his protective vest and a helmet. He lay down next to Bee. The sergeant was a slim 26-year-old at the time, carrying an M-16 rifle that seemed almost as large as him from some angles. He wasn't wearing any body armor or a helmet but poked his head above the wall, anyway, looking for targets. Tomasevic, then 38, kept taking pictures. Moments later, a shot hit the top of the wall near Bee's head, exploding the mud and knocking him down and backward. ""And for the first time in my career, I drop the camera,"" Tomasevic says in his clipped English, spoken with a Serbian accent. ""I look at him lying down. I said, 'Bee, Bee,' and I look: Where is the blood? The bleeding? And I look around and there is nothing, man, no bleeding."" Bee was briefly unconscious but apparently fine. Later, going through the images he took, Tomasevic showed Bee the picture he caught the moment the round hit the wall. ""You are going to be famous,"" he told the Marine. And within hours, the picture had appeared on websites and newspapers around the world. For more than a decade, a framed print of the picture hung on the walls of the Reuters newsroom in New York City, an exemplar of the news agency's photojournalism. That shot, taken by a photographer whose own life was forged by war in his native land, is one of the iconic pictures of the conflict in Afghanistan, capturing the eternal fragility of service members at war. Bee loves the picture. It makes him laugh. ""I look at it with fondness. I mean, yeah, the situation was shitty at the time, the environment sucked, the whole experience was godawful. Except for, you know, the firefights and stuff like that. That's, honestly, where I think I was having the most fun of my career,"" Bee says. ""As long as we're not losing guys, I'm having a blast doing that stuff."" As it turned out, Bee wasn't fine after that picture was taken. The concussive effect of the bullet hitting so close to his head knocked him out. The image may have documented the first traumatic injury to the front of his brain, where short-term memory and reasoning are processed. There would be at least one more head injury in June 2010 that resulted in the discovery of brain damage, his medical records show. Nearly a decade after his first deployment as one of the first Marines in Afghanistan, he would never be cleared for combat again. Bee, who left the Marines in April 2013, has a frontal lobe brain injury that affects his short-term memory. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and rage disorder. But that picture thrust him into the public eye, and he and his wife, Bobbie Bee, have used it to advance the cause of care of service members damaged by war. Today, Bee is routinely quoted in news stories published worldwide and is often cited as an example of how the Veterans Administration struggled to adequately care for service members suffering from mental health problems brought on by their service. Back in 2008, on the home front, Bobbie was pregnant with their son Ethan. It was Bee's third deployment in Afghanistan but the first time he had shipped out overseas since they were married in 2006. Until that picture was published, her husband's absence half a planet away in a war-ravaged land didn't seem very different from when he went away for training. Bee never called his wife to let her know about the picture, even though Tomasevic offered to let him use his satellite phone. Shortly after the picture was published, she stumbled onto it while visiting a news site for military families. ""I let out a scream that my parents still remember, because they thought I was going into labor,"" she says. ""When I saw that picture, I am, like, this is real."" It was 78 hours before he called and she was sure her husband was alive. ""When we first talked, it was like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited you're OK. And then I was like, WHERE WAS YOUR GEAR? And he's like, what happened to the sweet wife who is so thankful I'm OK?"" In the years that followed, Bee suffered from depression and flashbacks. Two or three times a week, he woke up feeling adrenaline rushing through his body as if readying himself for a bar fight. During the day, a mild irritant for most people could turn to fury in him. He self-medicated with alcohol, he says. In October 2010, Bobbie Bee says, she came home to find him passed out in the kitchen. Earlier they had fought, and he left her a note, saying goodbye. He wanted to die. ""I tried: two liters of tequila in about two minutes,"" he recalls. ""Her and I had got into a huge fight and I say: 'I'm done. Fuck this. I have had enough.'"" Bobbie Bee says she had struggled with his angry outbursts for months since his return, but now she was scared for his life. She wanted to take him to the hospital but worried about what it would do to his career. He was too heavy for her to move far, so she propped him up against the fridge and taped his head to the door so he couldn't choke on his vomit. ""I used really strong packing tape,"" she says, chuckling with her husband as they recall the episode. ""But at the time, it was horrifying. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have family. They were 500 miles away."" Fortunately, a corpsman friend lived nearby, and he brought over saline IV drips. He inserted them into his fellow Marine's arms, and eventually, Bee regained consciousness. ""And then I wake up with my head duct-taped to the fridge and two mainline IVs in my arm,"" he recalls. With the help of his wife, Bee eventually got treatment and now takes seven prescriptions every day, including several antipsychotic and anti-depression drugs. He has a job working for a company that designs autonomous targeting robots that the Marines use for combat training. He works nights, on Camp Lejeune, the famed Marine base near his home. Sitting on the back porch, Bobbie Bee watches her husband chat with Tomasevic, who's visiting the U.S. from his home in Turkey, and says she saw, in that moment, a bit of the man she met and married rather than the man who came home from war. The two men came together to reflect on the years of warfare in response to the 2001 attacks. ""Billy can tell you everything from June 8th, 2010, and prior, as if it just happened, but if you ask him what he had for dinner yesterday, he wouldn't remember,"" she says. ""The time he spent with Goran and things like that, he remembers. So that's what makes him happy."" And while sitting next to Tomasevic, he laughs and reminisces about the weeks they spent together, sleeping on cardboard, and numerous firefights with the Taliban. Bee's memory of those days is precise and detailed. ""I cannot believe I have come to his house,"" Tomasevic says. ""I feel really good, but I still can't believe I'm here talking to him. We can't stop talking."" Tomasevic spent about three weeks with Bee's unit in 2008. They came together again in 2010 in Marjah, Afghanistan, shortly before the last injury that ended the Marine's combat career. Tomasevic has continued working in conflict zones for Reuters, from the Arab Spring in Egypt to the fighting in Syria, Libya and, of course, Afghanistan. He insists he is more than the work he has done shooting conflict and despair. ""I am a professional. I shoot sports, whatever."" But he acknowledges that he takes special pride in his war work. ""I have an affection for war and conflict because I believe this is the hardest to do in this job."" Thirty years after joining Reuters during the civil war in his native country, then Yugoslavia, he says he can compartmentalize the images, so they don't damage him in the way others might be damaged. ""I grew up in a war zone. And I have been doing this for 30 years."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Indonesia records its lowest rate of positive coronavirus tests,2164,"JAKARTA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia's daily coronavirus positivity rate dropped below the World Health Organization's (WHO) benchmark standard of 5% this week for the first time, an indicator the country's devastating second wave could be easing. The positivity rate, or the proportion of people tested who are positive, peaked at 33.4% in July when Indonesia became Asia's coronavirus epicentre, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. On Monday that rate fell to 4.57%, the lowest since March 2020, when Indonesia's first cases were reported, according to independent data initiative, Kawal COVID-19.

"Reopen schools or disaster looms, experts tell Indian authorities",3401,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Many top Indian epidemiolgists and social scientists are urging authorities to reopen in-person school classes for all age groups, saying the benefits outweigh the risks especially as poor rural children are missing out on online education. The recommendation comes as experts say another COVID-19 wave in India this year could be far less deadly, because a dramatic rise in cases in April and May means a big majority of the population have been infected already, while more than half of its adults have been at least partly vaccinated. India last month approved its first COVID-19 shot for people under 18, though as of now only adults are being immunised. As new infections have stabilised around 40,000 a day in the past few weeks, some Indian states have restarted face-to-face teaching, mainly for middle school and above. Experts say that is not enough. ""Schools are an essential service. It has been wisely said that they should be the last to close and the first to reopen,"" said a report released on Monday on school education by a group of scholars, including economist and social scientist Jean Dreze, that warned of a ""looming disaster"". ""In India, the opposite has been happening: soon after the COVID-19 crisis struck in early 2020, all schools were closed without batting an eyelid and most of them are still closed today."" The health and education ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The federal government has largely left it to states to decide when to reopen schools. NO EDUCATION An August survey of nearly 1,400 school children done by the scholars' group found that in rural areas, only 8% were studying online regularly, 37% were not studying at all, and about half were unable to read more than a few words. Most parents wanted schools to reopen as soon as possible, it said. The reasons were that many children did not have their own smartphone, mobile connectivity was poor, they did not have the money to pay for mobile Internet, schools were not sending study material or online education was too hard to grasp for some. The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, whose roughly 6,000 members are doctors who have studied epidemiology, told the government in a report it was safe to resume all offline classes after taking precautions such as improved ventilation, physical distancing and masking. Epidemiologists also say that as India's last serological survey estimated that more than half of the country's population of 6-17 years had already been infected, without any particular severity, there was no reason to worry that a future wave will specifically target the unvaccinated ones among them. ""The risk of moderate to severe disease in children is really low and vaccination is not a prerequisite,"" said epidemiologist and public health expert Chandrakant Lahariya. ""Therefore, I believe that the technical experts should not rush to recommend vaccination of adolescents in India. The focus has to continue to be on achieving high coverage for all adult age groups,"" he said in an email. India has administered 701.9 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. India reported 31,222 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 33.1 million. Daily deaths rose by 290 to 441,042. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that millions of Afghans were in need of food aid and health assistance, urging donors to give more ahead of an international aid conference for Afghanistan on Sept. 13. The agency has released a flash appeal for around $600 million to meet humanitarian needs for 11 million people for the remainder of the year amid warnings of drought and starvation. ""Basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing and food and other lifesaving aid is about to run out,"" he said. ""We urge international donors to support this appeal fast and generously.""

"Nigeria's Delta region oil hub may need new COVID lockdown, governor says",1775,"YENAGOA, Nigeria, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The governor of Rivers State in Nigeria's oil-producing Delta region said he may be forced to reimpose COVID-19 lockdown measures if residents did not comply with prevention protocols amid a rise in cases. Governor Nyesom Wike implored residents to get vaccinated and comply with safety and social distancing rules amid a consistent rise in COVID-19 infections over the past two weeks. ""We may be constrained to re-impose the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the state if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits,"" Wike said in an address on Monday. Wike shared a copy of the speech with Reuters on Tuesday. Rivers state capital Port Harcourt is the gateway to the Delta region. Movement restrictions last year impinged on oil companies' ability to move workers around the region and forced some to delay or curtail maintenance. The state's 10,809 confirmed COVID-19 cases make it the third worst-hit state in Africa's most populous country, after Lagos and the federal capital territory of Abuja. On August 26, the state recorded 263 cases - the highest daily count since March 2020. The state has also recorded a total of 137 deaths. Wike also appealed to religious leaders and churches to encourage their members to get vaccinated and comply with the COVID-19 protocols. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, is battling a third wave of COVID-19 infections. The country began its vaccination campaign in March with nearly 4 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca shots provided via the COVAX scheme, and has since received millions more doses of AstraZeneca and Moderna shots. However it has also struggled with vaccine hesitancy. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Week ahead in Insurance: Sept. 7, 2021",3252,"(Reuters) - Here are some events of interest to the Insurance Law community this week. All times are local unless otherwise noted. Thursday, Sept. 9 10 a.m. – In arguments to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Allstate Insurance will defend a ruling by a federal judge in Brooklyn that allows it to seize and sell the home Mark Mirvis and his spouse transferred to their daughter in 2015, days after he was found jointly liable under RICO for using New York’s no-fault auto insurance laws to defraud health insurers of $46 million. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen last year voided the 2015 transfer, restoring the property to Mark and Lyubov Mirvis as a tenancy-by-the-entirety with right of survivorship; then, she found that Lyubov Mirvis had acted in bad faith, and extinguished her right of survivorship. Lyubov Mirvis argues that the lower court erred in its findings and that, in any event, the court could not extinguish a spouse’s right of survivorship under New York law. Chen noted that New York’s highest court had not weighed in that question and that lower state and federal courts had gone both ways.

G7 nations urge return to constitutional order in Tunisia,2045,"TUNIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The ambassadors of the G7 group of advanced economies urged Tunisia's president on Monday to appoint a new head of government as a matter of urgency and return to a constitutional order in which an elected parliament plays a significant role. The statement, put out by the British Embassy on social media, is the most significant public expression of unease by major democracies since President Kais Saied seized governing powers in July in moves his opponents called a coup. ""We underline the urgent need to appoint a new head of government to form a capable government able to address the immediate economic and health crises facing Tunisia,"" the statement said. Saied did not directly comment on the G7 statement. But in remarks later on Monday to the National Guard, he said: ""Tunisia is a sovereign country and sovereignty belongs to the people"". Western democracies have been among the most important donors helping to support Tunisian public finances over the past decade as the economy has slumped since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy. Saied, who was elected in 2019, said on July 25 he was freezing parliament, lifting the immunity of its members, dismissing the prime minister and that he would assume executive authority alongside a new premier. He said his intervention was in line with the constitution and necessitated by a national emergency due to political paralysis, high COVID-19 rates, and protests. He has vowed that rights will not be affected. Six weeks on, however, he has not named a prime minister or said what he plans to do, has indefinitely rolled over the emergency measures and said there can be ""no going back"", while Tunisians speculate about whether he will amend the constitution. The G7 statement said appointing a prime minister would ""create space for an inclusive dialogue about proposed constitutional and electoral reforms"" and added that democratic values would remain central to their relations with Tunisia.

"Mixing CanSinoBIO, Sinovac COVID shots induces stronger response than Sinovac alone -study",1808,"BEIJING, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A Chinese study looking at mixing COVID-19 vaccines showed that receiving a booster shot of CanSino Biologics' vaccine after one or two doses of Sinovac Biotech's (SVA.O) vaccine yielded a much stronger antibody response than using the Sinovac shot as a booster. The study, among the first analyses in China combing different COVID-19 vaccines, comes as the country said it would use booster shots in specific groups amid concerns over vaccines' waning protection over time. Participants who received a CanSinoBIO (6185.HK), booster dose three to six months after a second Sinovac shot showed a 78-fold jump on average in neutralizing antibody levels two weeks later, according to a paper published on Monday before a peer review. By contrast, those who received a Sinovac booster shot showed a 15.2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, researchers from local disease control authorities, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutions said in the paper. One dose of Sinovac followed by a CanSinoBIO booster at intervals of one or two months led to a 25.7-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels, while two doses of Sinovac induced a 6.2-fold increase. The study analysed data from about 300 healthy adults aged 18-59. The study did not assess the boosters' protection against COVID-19 and did not test the neutralising antibody against the more transmissible Delta variant, the paper said. More than 1.4 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been administered globally, about three quarters of them in China. China, which has kept local infections under control, has fully vaccinated around 69% of its population as of Sept. 6. It said on Tuesday a total of 2.1 billion doses had been administered as of Monday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

India 'prepares for the worst' ahead of possible COVID-19 third wave,4690,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases and deaths exploded in India in April and May, New Delhi's premier Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and several others ran so short of oxygen that many patients in the capital suffocated. When Reuters visited the hospital on Friday, its last coronavirus patient was readying to leave after recovery - a remarkable turnaround health experts attribute to growing levels of immunity from natural infection and vaccinations. But hospitals have learned from bitter experience during the second COVID wave, when funeral pyres burned non-stop and bodies littered the banks of the holy Ganges river, as India braces for another possible surge in infections around its September-November festival season. Beds have been added at facilities around the country, and hospitals are working to ensure ample supplies of oxygen. Ganga Ram is raising its oxygen storage capacity by 50%, has laid a one-kilometre-long pipeline carrying the gas directly to COVID ICUs, and is installing equipment to keep the oxygen flow high. It has also ordered an onsite oxygen-generation plant, which are mostly made in Europe and can take months to arrive given the surge in demand globally. ""In light of the possibility of the emergence of coronavirus mutants, with higher transmissibility and immune escape, the hospital continues to prepare for the worst,"" said Satendra Katoch, medical director of the hospital, in between guiding colleagues doing an internal audit of its facilities. The crowded private hospital, however, said it had no scope to add more beds. During the peak of India's second wave, Ganga Ram expanded its capacity by nearly 50% to about 600 beds, but even so, some 500 patients per day had to be put on a waitlist for admission, according to physician Varun Prakash, who managed its war-room during the crisis. Nationally, India has added many more hospital beds in the past few months and imported more than 100 oxygen carriers to raise the total to about 1,250. Companies such as Linde (LIND.NS)(LIN.N) are planning to lift the country's overall output of the gas by 50% to 15,000 tonnes a day. Linde told Reuters it had retained 60 of some 80 cryogenic containers - meant to hold super-cooled oxygen - it had brought in from the company's overseas operations, in case demand shot up again. ""The distribution infrastructure and logistics fell short during the second wave,"" Linde South Asia head, Moloy Banerjee, said. The federal government, meanwhile, has approved the construction of nearly 1,600 oxygen-generation plants at hospitals, though fewer than 300 had been set up as of early last month as imports take time. HIGH ANTIBODY LEVELS Almost all states are readying special paediatric wards as some experts warn unvaccinated children could be vulnerable to any new virus mutations. States including Madhya Pradesh are also stocking up on anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir. But with a government survey estimating as many as two-thirds of Indians already have COVID-fighting antibodies through natural infection, and 57% of its adults with at least an initial vaccine dose, many health experts believe any new outbreak of infections could be much less devastating than the second wave. ""The number of susceptible persons will be less now, as many persons have been infected or vaccinated,"" said epidemiologist and cardiologist K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Even if reinfections or breakthrough infections occur, they are likely to be mild and mostly managed at home. The serious gaps in health-service delivery that were evident in the second wave are less likely to be seen."" Kerala is seeing such signs already. The southern state currently has the highest number of infections, including many among vaccinated or partly vaccinated residents, but its fatality rate is well below the national figure. At 33.1 million, India has reported the most number of COVID-19 cases after the United States, with 441,042 deaths. It has administered 698.4 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. The health ministry, which wants to immunise India's entire adult population this year, did not respond to a request for comment on its preparations for a potential third wave. Epidemiologist and public health specialist Chandrakant Lahariya said the data and trends were encouraging. ""With the emerging evidence that for individuals with past infection, single dose may provide far greater levels of antibodies than people who did not have infection or receive both shots of vaccines, it is assuring for India.""

Indian court backs shorter dose gap for those paying for AstraZeneca vaccine,1961,"KOCHI, India, Sept 7 (Reuters) - An Indian court has ordered the government to offer a choice of a shorter four-week gap between doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine to those paying for the shots, down from 12 to 16 weeks now. India doubled the gap between doses of the locally-produced Covishield vaccine in May, to help stretch scarce supplies, so as to give at least one dose to 57% of its 944 million adults. But just 17% have been fully immunised. In an order posted on its website on Monday, the high court in the southern state of Kerala ordered changes in the health ministry's vaccine-booking platform to permit the choice, in line with that offered to those flying abroad. ""There is absolutely no reason why the same privilege shall not be extended to others who want early protection in connection with their employment, education, etc,"" the court said. In its remarks, the court drew a parallel with the government's permission for those planning overseas travel to choose between early and better protection from COVID-19 infections. The decision followed a plea by two garment companies with a total of more than 10,000 employees. The court asked the government to enable scheduling of the second dose within four weeks of the first for those who want it, in line with the gap specified in initial vaccine protocols. The health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The ministry has said its decision for a wider gap between doses was based on scientific evidence that the step boosted protection. India's immunisation campaign began in mid-January, with a four-week interval between two Covishield doses. India has injected 698.4 million doses of vaccine. About a quarter of the supplies are sold, with the rest provided free. India's tally of infections stands at 33.1 million, boosted by 31,222 new cases in the past 24 hours, with daily deaths up 290 for a total of 441,042.

FIFA chief says Brazil game abandonment was 'crazy',3563,"MANCHESTER, England, Sept 6 (Reuters) - FIFA is investigating the abandonment of the Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier with its president Gianni Infantino labelling the events ""crazy"", while Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly ready to take disciplinary action against their Argentine players. read more Brazilian health authorities intervened on Sunday after accusing four Argentine Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Spurs duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of Argentina's team when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa walked onto the field and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. read more Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia had also travelled from the UK and was in the stands. Anvisa said Brazilian rules make clear that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. It said Argentine players had made false statements about their previous whereabouts on immigration forms. Brazil's Federal Police said on Monday they had opened a formal inquiry into the actions of the Argentine players who, a spokesperson said, were deported. ""We can confirm an investigation has begun into the possible crime of supplying false information,"" a spokesperson said. ""Yesterday, the players were notified they must leave the country, which is the regular procedure, and statements from them were taken."" The Argentina squad left Brazil together on Sunday night and flew back to Buenos Aires. FIFA said it had received reports from match officials. ""The information will be analysed by the competent disciplinary bodies and a decision will be taken in due course,"" world soccer's governing body said in a statement. The Argentine Football Association said FIFA gave both national associations six days to outline their positions. DIFFICULT SITUATION Infantino, in a video address to the European Club Association's general assembly, said the situation was a reminder of the difficulties faced during the pandemic. ""We saw what happened with the game between Brazil and Argentina, two of South America's most glorious teams,"" Infantino said. ""Some officials, police, security officials entered the pitch after a few minutes of the game to take away some players - it is crazy but we need to deal with these challenges, these issues which come on top of the COVID crisis."" Alejandro Martinez, brother of Emiliano, said the players were due to fly from Argentina to Croatia, which is a UK green-list country, later on Monday to avoid the 10-day mandatory hotel quarantine on return to the UK from a red-list country. ""They will travel to Croatia to do their quarantine there and then go to England,"" Alejandro told radio station La Oral Deportiva. ""That was the condition set by Aston Villa."" The Argentine Football Association (AFA) said Martinez and Buendia had been released from the national team, meaning they will not take part in Thursday's qualifier at home to Bolivia. The AFA later released Spurs pair Lo Celso and Romero, saying, “they are out of the game against Bolivia and can return to their club”. The website football.london said the Spurs pair could expect club fines on their return to England having made the trip without the permission of their club. Villa and Tottenham declined to comment.

"Taliban claim control of Panjshir, opposition says resistance will continue",5536,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed victory on Monday in the last part of Afghanistan still holding out against their rule, declaring that the capture of the Panjshir valley completed their takeover of the country and they would unveil a new government soon. Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the gate of the Panjshir provincial governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), commanded by Panjshiri leader Ahmad Massoud. ""Panjshir, which was the last hideout of the escapee enemy, is captured,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference. Massoud did not concede defeat, saying his force, drawn from the remnants of the regular Afghan army as well as local militia fighters, was still fighting.

Japan to purchase 150 mln doses of Takeda-produced Novavax vaccines - drugmaker,1987,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T) said on Tuesday the Japanese government agreed to purchase 150 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it will produce using Novavax Inc's (NVAX.O) formula. Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker, is preparing to make the vaccine domestically and will distribute it in early 2022, pending approval from regulators, the company said in a statement. The TAK-019 vaccine is still undergoing clinical trials in Japan, according to Takeda. The terms of the deal with the government are confidential, Takeda said. Novavax is licensing and transferring manufacturing technologies to enable Takeda to manufacture the vaccine, according to the statement. The announcement builds on an earlier agreement between Takeda and the government to make some 250 million doses of the Novavax shot. The remaining doses could be given to other countries, Takeda has said previously. read more Japan has donated most of its domestically produced supplies of AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine, relying primarily on imported doses of the mRNA-type shots developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) for its national inoculation push. After a slow start, Japan's vaccination drive has made some progress in recent months, with 58% of the population now having received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Takeda is also handling the import and distribution of some 50 million doses of Moderna's vaccine this year and 50 million more next year. Three batches of Moderna supplies, or about 1.6 million doses, were recalled in Japan after the discovery of small metal contaminants in some vials. read more The health ministry said on Monday that a third person had died after getting a shot from the recalled Moderna supplies. Takeda said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the causes of death are being investigated, and there is no evidence they are linked to the vaccine. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. Justice Dept. says will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attack,1926,"WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law that imposed a near-total ban on abortion. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a 1994 law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act). The FACE Act prohibits the use of force and physical obstruction to interfere with a person obtaining or providing reproductive health services. Former President Bill Clinton backed the legislation in response to violence by anti-abortion activists in the 1980s and 90s. ""The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack,"" Garland said, adding that he would ""not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services."" Garland said the Justice Department would enforce the FACE Act while it ""urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons."" Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices arecloser than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected.

"France mourns 'national treasure' Belmondo, New Wave cinema star",2992,"PARIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Jean-Paul Belmondo, a star of France's New Wave cinema after his breakthrough performance in Jean-Luc Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (""Breathless"") in 1959, has died. He was 88. The death of a leading figure in French cinema was felt across the country. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that France had lost a ""national treasure"". ""It seems to me that all of France is sad,"" Michel Godest, Belmondo's friend and lawyer, told BFM TV, breaking down in tears. A charismatic actor who often performed his own stunts, Belmondo switched in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's leading comedy and action heroes. His decision to pursue a career in commercial cinema and to shun the art houses led to criticism that he had wasted his undisputed talent - something he always denied. ""When an actor is successful, people turn their back on him and say that he has taken the easy way out, that he doesn't want to make an effort or take any risks,"" Belmondo once said. ""But if it was so easy to fill cinemas, then the film world would be in much better health than it is. I don't think I would have stayed in the limelight for so long if I was doing any old rubbish. People aren't that stupid."" Godest told AFP that Belmondo passed away at home, adding: ""He had been very tired for some time. He died peacefully."" 'HOOLIGAN'S FACE' Belmondo was born on April 9, 1933, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the son of the renowned sculptor Paul Belmondo and painter Sarah Rainaud-Richard. Despite his cultured background, he appeared more drawn to the world of sport than the arts and was a keen boxer in his youth. Once he had discovered acting, it took three attempts before the Paris Conservatory agreed in 1952 to take him on as a student. Even then it was not a smooth passage, and Belmondo quit in a huff in 1956 after receiving a cool reception for one of his performances from a conservatory jury. One of his teachers predicted at the time: ""Mr. Belmondo will never succeed with his hooligan's face."" Belmondo's reply was an obscene gesture. He went on to star in more than 80 movies, many of them blockbusters, over the next half a century. Belmondo first gained acclaim in ""Sois belle et tais-toi"" (""Look pretty and shut up"") in 1958 and in ""A double tour"" by Claude Chabrol in 1959, where his magnetism stole the film. But his role as a small-time hood who romanced American ingenue Jean Seberg in Godard's ""Breathless"" earned him international stardom. Belmondo's appeal, a mixture of cynicism and sensitivity, warmth and unselfconscious ease, created a new kind of romanticism that brought him roles in the films of France's New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Alain Resnais and Louis Malle. ""If I have advice to give young actors, it is to never neglect technique: without technique, you limit invention. But it should never show. What counts is the result, not the sweat and the pain it cost,"" he once said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"G20 urges COVID help for poor states, but short on new commitments",2631,"ROME, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The group of 20 rich countries said on Monday more efforts were needed to help poor countries vaccinate their populations against COVID-19, but steered clear of making new numerical or financial commitments. Italy, which holds the G20 presidency this year, said after the gathering that the ""Pact of Rome,"" where the meeting was held on Sunday and Monday, included a political agreement to increase support for poor nations and send them more vaccines. ""The level of (vaccine) inequality is too high and is not sustainable,"" Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters. ""If we leave part of the world without vaccines we risk new variants which will hurt all of us...Our message is very clear: no one must be left behind in the vaccination campaign."" Vaccines are being shipped to poor countries through the international COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). However, richer nations have come under fire for allegedly stockpiling COVID-19 jabs as many underdeveloped countries with low inoculation rates and rising infections struggle to get supplies. read more ""The strongest countries...are committed to investing significant resources and sending vaccines to the most fragile...We should strengthen this system bilaterally and through international platforms starting from COVAX,"" Speranza said. However, asked whether the G20 had made any new concrete financial commitments, he warned such pledges risked being a ""straitjacket,"" and the important thing was a ""political goal"" of global vaccination. ""We want to take the vaccine to the whole world and we'll make the investments necessary. Will they be enough? Will more be needed? The countries of the world are making a commitment in this direction,"" he said. A 11-page declaration released after the meeting made no new financial pledges, but Speranza said these may be delivered at a joint meeting of G20 health and finance ministers in October. That will be ""a decisive occasion to find the resources to finance the instruments we have put on the table"", he said. A little over 230 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to 139 countries under COVAX, GAVI data shows, against a target to secure 2 billion doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. Speranza stressed that poor countries must also be helped to produce vaccines at home. ""Transferring doses is not enough. We have to make other areas of the world capable of producing, sharing methodologies and procedures,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
BGI prenatal gene test under scrutiny for Chinese military links,9251,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Health regulators in five countries are examining a prenatal test that collects the DNA of women and fetuses for research, while some doctors that promoted it and clinics that sell it say they were unaware the company that produces it also conducts research with the Chinese military. The test, made by Shenzhen-based BGI Group and marketed under the brand name NIFTY, is sold in at least 52 countries. It screens for Down syndrome and more than 80 other genetic conditions, and has been taken by 8.4 million women globally. The regulators' concerns, raised in response to a Reuters report, highlight the challenges of regulatory oversight when genetic data is sent from one country to another. Canada's privacy commissioner said the report raised important questions about ""highly sensitive"" information and it is looking into the matter. Two regulators in Europe - in Slovenia and in Germany - said they were examining the test in light of European Union data protection rules. The data privacy regulator in Slovenia, where one of BGI's regional partners is based, said it was concerned by the exporting of data from the BGI tests and would examine data protection issues. But it added that Slovenia has not yet adopted the changes to its national laws to make Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fully applicable, so it cannot issue fines in the event of GDPR breaches. Reuters reported in July that more than a dozen scientific studies - including clinical trials - showed BGI developed and improved the test in collaboration with People's Liberation Army hospitals. BGI uses the pregnant women's genetic data for research into the traits of populations. It also collaborates with the PLA in other areas of research. BGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the NIFTY test in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent. It said it works with thousands of healthcare providers, that other prenatal test providers in China work with military hospitals, and that many companies worldwide work with militaries. It said it takes data privacy seriously, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and only 5% of its NIFTY tests have been conducted on women overseas. Consent forms signed by women outside China seek permission for their blood samples and genetic data to be sent abroad to BGI and used for research. The privacy policy on the test’s website also says data can be shared for national security purposes in China - though BGI says it has never been asked to do so. Regulators in Germany, Australia, Estonia and Canada called for transparency in BGI's use of women's genetic data, and said even if data was sent abroad, BGI's local vendors are responsible for ensuring data privacy. The European Data Protection Supervisor said it was monitoring the situation. ""It is vital that the patient is provided with clear information,"" said Beverley Rowbotham, chairperson of Australia's National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. A regulator in Ontario told Reuters it is now advising women to seek tests from providers in Canada, or places where data security is ""comparable"" to the protections mandated in Canada. The regulator in Quebec said prenatal tests - like consumer genetic tests - can result in people losing control over their genetic information. Canadian privacy and genetic disclosure laws can impose maximum fines of C$250,000 to C$1 million for breaches, and set strict conditions for exemptions for scientific research. ""Genetic information is not only valuable to marketers and data brokers, but also to foreign states and cybercriminals as well,"" the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario told Reuters. Fertility Partners, a clinic network in Canada, said it had no prior knowledge of BGI's work with the PLA, and had stopped selling NIFTY through its clinics in April for unrelated reasons. Reuters has previously reported that BGI's joint research with PLA medical institutes is wide ranging, from efforts to protect soldiers from altitude sickness to mass testing for pathogens. U.S. government advisers warned in March that a vast bank of genomic data that BGI is amassing and analyzing with artificial intelligence could give China a path to economic and military advantage. read more The same military hospital that ran clinical trials for NIFTY also collaborated with BGI to send pathogens into space under a military equipment research program, according to 12 scientific papers, which has not previously been reported. BGI did not respond to a request for more information about that research program. In the United Kingdom, where NIFTY tests are only sold through private clinics, the government said BGI would need to register its test before Sept. 1 to continue selling them. BGI told Reuters it submitted a voluntary registration to the UK medical regulator in August. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Reuters it had received BGI’s registration but said the application had not yet had data validation and scrutiny by the regulator's registration and software team. read more NIFTY tests are sold overseas through three business models: local clinics collect blood samples to send to BGI in Hong Kong; labs sequence the DNA from blood samples locally and share the data with BGI in Hong Kong where it is stored for five years; or labs complete the entire process locally using BGI technology. Labs in Spain and Slovenia each told Reuters the genetic data of a client had been used by BGI in mainland China for research, with informed consent. Slovenia-based GenePlanet, which says it sells NIFTY tests across Europe and also offers its own-branded test using BGI's technology, said the Slovenia customer gave consent for a ""research test."" GenePlanet says it operates according to EU regulations and has an agreement with BGI that ""none of the GenePlanet patient data generated from (the) NIFTY process is going to mainland China."" The Slovenian and Spanish women's data was among that of 542 women stored in China's National GeneBank, which BGI also runs. BGI said the data of the 542 women has not been used for other purposes, and its ""scientific research only uses anonymised data."" Eluthia GmbH, a laboratory in Germany which sells BGI's test, said its transfer of women's blood and patient data to BGI had been suspended by the data protection regulator for the Hesse region while it investigates whether the rules had been violated read more . Eluthia said it did not know when it could resume sending tests to BGI. Its Chief Executive Ramon Enriquez Schaefer said doctors had called the suspension ""excessive"" since patients had ""expressly consented to the shipment to Hong Kong."" He also said Eluthia hasn't been able to make ""concrete progress"" on the regulator's concerns about BGI's military collaboration. BGI told Reuters it is providing information to Eluthia and relevant government authorities to demonstrate it complies with data protection laws. DOCTORS' VIEWS One UK doctor who promoted BGI's test in an online video when it first became available said he would now advise women not to take the BGI test, due to privacy concerns. ""My personal view now would be to advise anybody not to use the BGI NIFTY test - not from a clinical point of view - but because the data from it might be misappropriated or used for reasons that neither the clinician nor the patient would ever have imagined,"" said Bryan Beattie, a fetal medicine consultant. Reuters contacted Beattie and two other UK doctors who also promoted the test on BGI's YouTube channels in 2014 for their reactions. The doctors said they were unaware of BGI's military links. BGI said the doctors were not paid to participate and it had told them the videos were for educational and marketing purposes. The NIFTY test captures more genetic information about the mother and the fetus than the results patients see, said Beattie, which has previously been reported by Reuters and BGI has confirmed. ""If you were able to link that to large numbers of patients in a foreign country, you would have a fairly good idea of their health profile over the next sort of 20 or 30 years,"" said Beattie. Beattie said he had supported the relatively new technology because it was an improvement on previous methods, but his clinic had switched to a different supplier for reasons unrelated to privacy. An Estonian scientist who turned down an offer from BGI in 2020 to replace a test developed by his lab with NIFTY said he was concerned European health services, whom he declined to name, were choosing BGI's test because of its cheaper cost and not considering data security. ""It is a stupidly easy way to earn money for taking a blood sample,"" said Kaarel Krjutskov, who runs the Estonian lab.

Chilean health regulator approves CoronaVac use among children over age 6,1409,"SANTIAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Chilean health regulator on Monday approved the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) for use in children over 6 years of age, allowing more people to be included in the country's rapid inoculation campaign. The South American country has already approved the use of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) vaccine for children over 12, with 654,053 receiving at least one dose since May. Sinovac's CoronaVac has formed the backbone, however, of Chile's vaccination campaign, which has seen more than 13 million of the country's 19 million inhabitants fully inoculated so far and 19.49 million CoronaVac doses issued in total. ""This is great news for school-age children and those that were not included in previous vaccination plans,"" said Health Minister Enrique Paris. Five of the experts on the evaluation panel convened by the Institute of Public Health (ISP) voted in favor of applying the shot to children over 6, while two voted in favor of issuing it only to those over 12, and one voted against issuing it to children. CoronaVac also has emergency approval for use in children in Indonesia and China. Chile has seen in recent weeks a noticeable drop in infections, recording just 435 new cases on Monday. It has had a total of 1.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 37,108 deaths. ​ Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK announces extra 5.4 bln pounds to help COVID-hit health services,2230,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Britain will set aside a further 5.4 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) over the next six months to help its National Health Service cover additional costs from the COVID-19 pandemic and to tackle the huge treatment backlog. Record-breaking waiting lists for routine hospital treatment and an unprecedented summer demand for emergency services are heaping pressure on the health service in England. ""The NHS was there for us during the pandemic - but treating COVID patients has created huge backlogs,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. ""This funding will go straight to the frontline, to provide more patients with the treatments they need but aren’t getting quickly enough."" The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, warned last week that the health service will need about 10 billion pounds more a year to reduce the COVID-19 backlog and cover additional costs from the pandemic. The extra funding announced by the government includes 1 billion pounds to help tackle the backlog and 2.8 billion pounds to cover related costs such as enhanced infection control measures to keep staff and patients safe from the virus. The total number of people who have been referred for hospital care rose in June to 5.45 million, the highest monthly figure since records began, NHS England figures show. Britain's health secretary Sajid Javid last month said that an estimated 7 million people who might have needed to use the health service during the pandemic did not access it – and the waiting list will climb further as more of them seek care. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases have started to climb again over the past month, raising the possibility there could soon be an increase in hospital admissions. The ambulance service handled more than 1 million 999 calls in July, the highest monthly figure on record. More than 2,200 accident and emergency patients waited more than 12 hours on trolleys to be admitted to a ward, the figures showed. The government said the extra funding would take total COVID-19 support for the health service to more than 34 billion pounds this year alone.

Hundreds of health centres at risk of closure in Afghanistan - WHO,1675,"GENEVA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Hundreds of medical facilities in Afghanistan are at risk of imminent closure because the Western donors who finance them are barred from dealing with the new Taliban government, a World Health Organization official said on Monday. Around 90% of 2,300 health facilities across the country might have to close as soon as this week, the UN health agency's regional emergency director, Rick Brennan, told Reuters in an interview. He said may Western donors had regulations which prevented them from dealing with the Taliban, without going into further detail. ""We are going to have a pause in operations in a large proportion of those (health facilities). By some estimates up to 90% will cease functioning probably later in the week and that will be associated with increased illness and death,"" Brennan said. The WHO was trying fill the gap by providing supplies, equipment and financing to 500 of the health centres, he said. The agency was also liaising with Qatar for medical deliveries to come by plane, he added. read more ""We are hoping to have up to two or three plane-loads of supplies airlifted from the government of Qatar probably into Kabul in the next week or so,"" he said. The next deliveries would include COVID tests and supplies to treat chronic diseases. Along with other aid agencies, the WHO has struggled to bring in medical supplies including trauma kits partly because of chaos at Kabul airport. read more Medical supplies continue to be flown in via the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the WHO is also exploring overland options via trucks from Pakistan, Brennan said.

8th Circ finds no evidence of Medicaid fraud by Planned Parenthood,3627,"(Reuters) - A former clinic director failed to offer evidence that Planned Parenthood of the Heartland intentionally miscoded abortion-related services to get Medicaid to pay for them between 2006 and 2008, a federal appeals court held. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a win Friday for the Iowa-based nonprofit, represented by Dentons, on the remnants of a False Claims Act lawsuit that the Alliance Defending Freedom and Hixson & Brown had filed in 2011 on behalf of Susan Thayer. On the miscoding claim, Thayer accused Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (PPH) of coding post-abortion followup visits as generic post-surgical consultations, then adding the code to bills for contraceptive counseling or other services that Medicaid does cover. The consultation did not increase the charges on two of the six sample bills Thayer submitted as evidence of PPH's practice, but had resulted in a one-level upgrade, good for an extra $12, on each of the other four. “We assume without deciding that she is right, and that Planned Parenthood falsely billed (Medicaid) for these services,” Circuit Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote. However, that alone would not support Thayer’s claim that the falsehood was intentional, he said. Like the lower court, “we think a one-level difference in billing, resulting in less than a $12.00 reimbursement difference, is at most evidence of an innocent mistake or negligence, not a willful lie to cheat the government,” Kobes wrote. He was joined by Circuit Judges Steven Colloton and Roger Wollman. PPH’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. PPH merged with several other Planned Parenthood organizations in 2018 to create Planned Parenthood North Central States. Thayer’s attorneys did not respond directly, but the Alliance Defending Freedom emailed a statement saying that ADF and its client are considering their options. According to Thayer’s 2011 complaint in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, she had worked for PPH between 1991 and 2008 and had managed two of its centers. Thayer alleged that the organization overbilled Medicaid in many different ways between 2002 and 2008, resulting in an estimated $28 million in extra charges. U.S. District Judge John Jarvey granted PPH’s motion to dismiss the case in 2013, finding that Thayer had not plausibly alleged fraud. Thayer appealed, and the 8th Circuit revived some of her claims in 2014. Jarvey further narrowed the suit on remand. By 2019, just two counts remained on Thayer’s Third Amended Complaint: the abortion-related coding claims, and an allegation that PPH had distributed oral contraceptives to women without a prescription. Both sides moved for summary judgment. On the upcoding claim, Jarvey found that Thayer’s evidence would support, at most, an inference of non-actionable coding or billing errors. The 8th Circuit agreed on Friday. On the contraceptive claims, Jarvey ruled for PPH after finding that Thayer had insufficiently pleaded her case. She sought judgment on the basis that PPH had billed Medicaid for extra cycles of pills it dispensed to clients whose prescriptions had expired, but her complaint was focused on bills for contraceptives dispensed before the client ever obtained a prescription, he said. The 8th Circuit affirmed that ruling as well on Friday. The case is Susan Thayer v. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-2151.

Vietnam's capital ramps up testing after extending COVID-19 curbs,2337,"HANOI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, extended COVID-19 restrictions on Monday for a further two weeks, as authorities launched a plan to conduct tests on the city's 8 million people to try to curb a climb in infections that started in late April. The Southeast Asian country dealt successfully with the virus for much of the pandemic, but the virulent Delta variant has proved more challenging in recent months. COVID-19 has infected more than 536,000 people in Vietnam and killed 13,385, the vast majority in the past few months. Hanoi, which has ordered people to stay home and halted all non-essential activities since July, has divided the city into ""red"", ""orange"" and ""green"" zones based on infection risk. ""People in quarantine camps, isolated areas or in red areas will be tested three times per week,"" city authorities said in a statement late on Monday, adding that people in other zones would be tested every five to seven days by either a PCR or rapid antigen test. Barricades on Monday separated red zones from other areas, photographs posted on social media and media outlets showed. Hanoi has been reporting 50 cases daily on average and has recorded over 4,100 cases since the pandemic began, official data showed. Hanoi authoritiesare eager to keep the outbreak from reaching the intensity seen in Ho Chi Minh City, which accounts for nearly half of the total infections and 80% of fatalities. In the southern business hub,where a strict lockdown is in place until Sept. 15, people have been encouraged to test themselves using antigen COVID-19 kits after health services were overwhelmed. In a rare live broadcast of questions from the public to an official late on Monday, Phan Van Mai, chairman of Ho Chi Minh City, said some restaurants in safe zones would be allowed to reopen for takeaway and that city authorities would look to gradually reopen the economy. One-third of Hanoi's residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine and the Health Ministry on Sunday called on the capital and Ho Chi Minh City to vaccinate all adult residents with at least one dose by Sept. 15. read more Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.4% of its 98 million people fully vaccinated, and 19% with one shot.

Argentina's Martinez still nonplussed over abandoned World Cup qualifier,3254,"BUENOS AIRES, Sept 6 (Reuters) - One of the players at the centre of Sunday's cancelled Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier has recalled the farcical scenes in Sao Paulo and what he said was despair at the thought of being obliged to stay in Brazil for 14 days of quarantine. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was one of four English Premier League players in the Argentina squad for the game away to arch-rivals Brazil. The match was suspended minutes after kick off when officials from Brazil’s health regulator came onto the pitch to stop the England-based players from playing because, according to the body, they had not completed the required 14-day quarantine on arrival in Sao Paulo. read more Martinez told reporters none of the Argentina players sheltering in the dressing room knew what was going on as officials at the side of the pitch discussed whether or not the match could continue. “We spent half an hour waiting to see if we could restart but after 40 minutes they told us we had to leave,” he said in Buenos Aires. “Then there was this despair, if I’d have to stay with the England lads for 14 days. It was all so uncertain. “We didn’t understand what was going on,” he added. Martinez plus Tottenham Hotspur defender Cristian Romero and midfielder Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentina lineup, while Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia was in the stands. “Obviously there had been rumours that the Premier League players wouldn’t play in the game but they would have told us when we arrived in Brazil and so we didn’t make any big show about cancelling the match,” said Martinez. “It was simple, we were going to win and we felt good.” PAIR RELEASED The Argentina squad were allowed to fly to Buenos Aires on Sunday night and Martinez and fellow Villa player midfielder Emiliano Buendia were released on Monday morning and permitted to rejoin their club. “Villa did not understand why it happened, but everyone saw it,” Martinez said before flying out. “It was supposed to be a great game for us to enjoy, not a spectacle.” The farcical scenes were an embarrassment for South American football and came at the end of a turbulent week. Some European sides had stopped their players travelling to South America because they would have to quarantine on return and potentially miss important club matches. Brazil were without nine key players, and other nations, Paraguay and Uruguay among them, also had some players missing. But Martinez, who established himself as first choice during Argentina’s triumphant Copa America campaign in June and July, said there was no way he would have given up playing for his country. “The four from England decided to go because we love the shirt,” he said. “No matter how much the Premier League (players) didn’t want to come, we decided we were going anyway. Because after the Copa America, everyone wanted to be there. ""It’s something beautiful and we must live with the consequences. On a personal level I needed to play these games.” Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina.

Analysis: Turkey and UAE rein in dispute that fuelled conflict and hurt economy,5128,"ANKARA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A truce between bitter regional rivals Turkey and the United Arab Emirates has calmed tensions that fuelled conflicts including Libya's war, officials and diplomats say, after years of animosity and insults. But with political differences still running deep, the two countries are expected to focus on building economic ties and de-escalating, rather than resolving, an ideological rift that has drawn a faultline through the Middle East. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the UAE's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, spoke by phone last week following contacts between intelligence and government officials. Erdogan, who a year ago said Turkey could cut diplomatic relations with Abu Dhabi after it set up ties with Israel, also discussed UAE investment in Turkey with Abu Dhabi's national security adviser. ""The UAE is interested in exploring prospects of reinforcing ties,"" an Emirati official said, pointing to trade and investment opportunities in transportation, health and energy. The talks follow earlier efforts by Turkey to ease tensions with UAE allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt, with a delegation from Cairo due in Ankara on Tuesday. Those contacts have so far yielded little, but some see the UAE track moving more swiftly. ""It's going very fast,"" said a diplomat in the Gulf. ""Faster than many people thought it would. They have turned the page."" A senior Turkish official described Erdogan's call last week with Sheikh Mohammed as a significant move towards overcoming disputes which have plagued their relations, saying the two countries could work together in the Middle East. ""But first there will be steps taken in terms of the economy,"" the official said. Other issues ""are not agreed, but a desire was formed (to tackle) the large part of these problems."" COST OF RIVALRY The rift stems from the Arab uprisings, when Turkey backed the Muslim Brotherhood and their Islamist allies challenging entrenched autocrats from Tunisia to Syria - alarming the UAE's dynastic rulers, who see the Brotherhood as a political and security threat. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a Gulf dispute, putting it at odds with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while Turkish support last year helped Libya's U.N.-backed government drive back UAE-supported forces trying to seize the capital. The two countries have traded accusations of interference beyond their borders, and Erdogan once chided the UAE's foreign minister as an impudent nouveau riche when he retweeted comments critical of Ottoman forces - forebears of modern Turkey. In Somalia, Turkey and the UAE have competed for influence. In Syria, Turkey still supports fighters opposed to President Bashar al-Assad while the UAE, which once backed rebels fighting him, has opened an embassy in Damascus. Turkish officials and Gulf diplomats say both countries recognise their geopolitical tensions came at an economic price, heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. That cost was felt particularly by Erdogan in Turkey, where stubbornly high 19% inflation has driven up the cost of living and where state banks sold $128 billion in foreign reserves last year in an attempt to support the tumbling lira. ""The cost of strained ties is not sustainable in the region when it comes to Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia,"" a second Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The departure of U.S. President Donald Trump removed a leader who emboldened their rival regional interventions. Although no agreement has been announced on investments, the two countries already have an economic platform to build on. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which maintains an unofficial boycott of Turkish exports, the UAE says it remains Turkey's largest regional trading partner. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth funds have also made significant recent investments in Turkey's online grocer Getir and e-commerce platform Trendyol. Political differences will be harder to overcome, with Egypt and its Gulf allies insistent that Ankara pull out troops and Turkey-backed Syrian fighters from Libya, a demand which diplomats say is a priority for Cairo and its allies. Nevertheless, a decade on from the ""Arab Spring"" the revolutions are mostly over and the Muslim Brotherhood has been weakened - easing two of Abu Dhabi's main sources of friction with Erdogan, who strongly backed Brotherhood figures. ""For Saudi Arabia and the UAE this is not the priority file that it used to be,"" said Galip Dalay, a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. In a gesture to Cairo earlier this year, which would also have been noted in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, Turkey asked Egyptian opposition channels including Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist-leaning broadcasters, to tone down criticism of Egypt. Turkey still blocks access to the websites of some UAE organisations, including the state news agency, but the government has halted what was once a regular barrage of criticism directed at the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. ""There is a desire on both sides to de-escalate, and see what happens,"" Dalay said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Russian aluminium giant says could recall personnel from Guinea if crisis worsens,2257,"MOSCOW, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal (RUAL.MM), said on Monday it aimed to keep its three major bauxite mines and one alumina refinery in Guinea operating after the military coup there, but could evacuate all Russian personnel if the crisis worsened. Moscow has a long history of relations with Conakry that goes back to trade and economic cooperation during the Soviet era, and is currently focused mainly on the metals business. The coup in the West African nation with the world's largest bauxite reserves, used to produce aluminium, sent prices of the metal to a 10-year high on Monday. There was no immediate indication of any supply disruptions. read more Rusal, the world's third largest aluminium producer, is a big presence in Guinea's key bauxite industry with its mines accounting for 42% of Rusal's total bauxite capacity. ""In connection with the events taking place in the Republic of Guinea, Rusal's number one priority is the health and safety of its employees and the continuity of its production processes,"" Rusal said in a statement. ""In case of further escalation, the company is considering options for the evacuation of Russian personnel from the republic,"" it added. Russia-focused producer Nordgold operates the Lefa gold mine in Guinea, which accounted for 17% of Nordgold's total production in 2020. ""Nordgold remains unaffected by the current political situation in Guinea and our mine site continue to operate as normal... We are monitoring the situation closely,"" Nordgold said in a statement. The Russian foreign ministry called on the Guinean military to immediately release President Alpha Conde as itjoined other nations in denouncing Sunday's coup. read more ""Moscow opposes any attempt at unconstitutional change of leadership,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""We demand the release of Mr Conde and a guarantee of his immunity. We consider it necessary to return the situation in Guinea to constitutional norms as soon as possible.""

UK PM's planned tax hike for social care triggers fury within ruling party,4682,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to hike taxes to fund social care has provoked fury among many of his own lawmakers, who fear that such a clear violation of his election promises shows he is happy to oversee a sweeping expansion of the state. After the fiscal splurge on the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson is now addressing Britain's creaking social care system, whose costs will soar as the population ages, while facing numerous other thorny policy matters. Johnson wants to raise the National Insurance (NI) tax paid by working people to subsidise care for pensioners, including wealthy retirees, according to British media. But many lawmakers from Johnson's own Conservative Party worry this will hurt younger, low-income workers and breach his 2019 election guarantee not to raise the rate of NI - which still adorns the Conservatives' website. ""The proposal will be aimed at supporting the more affluent, but the tax will be paid by lower income earners. That's unfair,"" one Conservative lawmaker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. ""We shouldn't break solemn election promises unless there are hugely good reasons to do so."" Like many other Western leaders, Johnson is facing demands to spend more on welfare after government borrowing ballooned to 14.2% of economic output - a level last seen at the end of World War Two. The row over his planned tax hike comes after charges that Britain was unprepared for the chaotic fall of Afghanistan, while the country is also facing labour shortages and supply chain problems exacerbated by Brexit, as well as a high COVID-19 death toll. Johnson is due to address parliament on the Afghanistan situation later on Monday, and the BBC said he would shortly announce a new 5.5 billion pound ($7.6 billion) package for the National Health Service. Details of the NI hike are likely to come later, possibly on Tuesday. 'TAX-AND-SPEND' For years, British leaders have been trying to find a way to pay for social care without endangering support by hiking taxes. Johnson said he had a plan for social care in 2019. British ministers are still thrashing out the details but Johnson had been expected to announce a roughly 1 percentage point increase on the rate of NI paid by workers and their employers, which official estimates show would raise around 10 billion pounds a year. ""With regards to our plans for social care, we are committed to setting out long-term sustainable reform of the sector and that is what we will do,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters on Monday. The finance ministry declined to comment. While Johnson's huge majority of 80 in parliament means a defeat may be unlikely, members of his own cabinet have hinted at their opposition to tax hikes. House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg on Sunday invoked former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who came to regret saying ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" during the 1988 election campaign. ""(Voters) remembered those words after President Bush had forgotten them,"" Rees-Mogg wrote in a Sunday Express opinion piece. Many of Johnson's lawmakers fear raising taxes will alienate many of the voters in northern England who supported him in the 2019 election, when he promised explicitly not to raise income tax, Value-Added Tax or National Insurance. BIGGEST EVER BENEFIT CUT Johnson also promised in 2019 to maintain the ""triple lock"", which annually links the state pension to whichever is highest out of inflation, earnings or a 2.5% increase. Owing to a statistical quirk during the pandemic, the official measure of earnings is running at almost 9% - which would result in a bumper payout to pensioners just as the government has stressed the need to tighten belts. ""Given that average wage levels have been skewed by the unprecedented events of the past 18 months, the (finance minister) should temporarily suspend the wages element of the lock,"" said Mel Stride, who heads parliament's Treasury Committee of lawmakers. Johnson faces more widespread resistance to plans to remove a 20 pounds-per-week increase to state benefits, known as Universal Credit, that was introduced at the height of the pandemic. The move would affect 4.4 million households from mid-October. ""If the (government) goes ahead with this cut, it would be the largest overnight benefit reduction that has ever happened,"" researchers Torsten Bell, Adam Corlett and Daniel Tomlinson said in a report published by the Resolution Foundation think tank on Monday. ""That should give policy makers reason to pause as to whether this is a good idea – politically, economically or morally."" ($1 = 0.7225 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
India plans 50% increase in oxygen production before third COVID-19 wave,2115,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - India aims to ramp up its medical oxygen production capacity to 15,000 tonnes per day before a potential third wave of coronavirus infections that is expected to hit the country as soon as mid-September, an industry executive said. The target implies a 50% jump from the maximum output of almost 10,000 tonnes reached earlier this year during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave, when hospitals ran short of the gas and relatives of patients had to search out oxygen cylinders. Linde India (LIND.NS) supplied nearly one-third of the total oxygen demand during the peak. Moloy Banerjee, head of Linde South Asia, said that while the government is targeting 15,000 tonnes of medical oxygen per day, Linde and other manufacturers were hoping to hit production of at least 13,500 tonnes per day ahead of the third wave. As of Monday, India's total COVID-19 cases had reached 33.03 million, with the death toll at 440,752, according to health ministry data. While demand for medical oxygen in India has considerably reduced since the peak, reaching near pre-COVID levels, gas companies along with the government are gearing up for a scenario where the third wave could be worse than the previous one. The New Delhi government said last month it will increase oxygen production by setting up new manufacturing units or expanding the production capacity of existing units for uninterrupted oxygen supply during a health crisis. Shares of Linde India rose to record levels in the days following the Delhi government's notification and have more than doubled for the year as of Monday's closing price. ""There have been discussions with the Delhi government since the second wave of COVID-19. We are still reviewing the policy and trying to see if it is workable for Linde,"" Banerjee added. The company has not entered any formal agreement with the government. Linde has also been in touch with the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states to support setting up of additional oxygen storage capacities and manufacturing units.

JD.com says founder Liu to step away from day-to-day operations,2910,"SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China's JD.com (9618.HK) said on Monday founder and chief executive Richard Liu will switch his focus to the e-commerce giant's long-term strategy, creating the new role of president to run the company's day-to-day operations. The move comes as several other founders of China's tech companies have gradually relinquished the top job, such as at Alibaba and ByteDance, although Liu, 48, will retain his title as chief executive and his board seat. The new role of president will be filled by Xu Lei, currently CEO of JD's biggest division, who has taken on a more prominent public role at the company in recent years. Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, will also spend more time mentoring younger management and contributing to the revitalisation of rural areas, JD said in a statement. ""Looking to the future, the correct long-term strategic design, the growth and development of young talents, and the healthy and coordinated development of various business units will continue to be the driving force for JD, in doing the hardest and most challenging, but right and most valuable things for the industry,"" Liu said in the statement. Liu owns nearly 80% of JD's voting power, according to its 2020 annual report, and some investors have previously raised concerns his tight control, coupled with the lack of an obvious successor, had posed a management risk. His control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2017 following a rape allegation, which he denied. Liu was not charged but the incident caused a storm on Chinese social media. Citi analysts said Xu's promotion reflected the way he had proven his leadership and management skills in spearheading JD Retail's operations and he was a potential successor to Liu. ""We believe if Mr. Xu further proves his management capability, we would not be surprised if he is positioned as a potential successor to Mr. Richard Liu should Mr. Liu decide to step down one day,"" they said in a Monday note. Xin Lijun, who previously headed up JD Health (6618.HK), will take over from Xu as JD Retail's chief while Jin Enlin will become JD Health's new CEO. Following Xu's promotion, Liu will retain his board seat and position as CEO of JD.com, a company spokesperson confirmed. In 2019, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) co-founder Jack Ma formally stepped down as chairman of the e-commerce giant, handing over reigns to Daniel Zhang. In 2021, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced he would step down from his role as CEO, while Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) founder stepped down as chairman following an earlier resignation of his CEO title. Chinese authorities have also launched a wave of new industry regulations and penalties since late 2020, many of which have targeted the internet sector in particular.

McIlroy lends support to Osaka over decision to take break,1589,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Golfer Rory McIlroy has backed Naomi Osaka's decision to take a break from tennis following the Japanese world number three's elimination from the U.S. Open last week, saying that it was important that athletes did not let results define them. A tearful Osaka told reporters that she would be taking some time off from the sport after crashing out in the third round at Flushing Meadows to 19-year-old Leylah Fernandez, adding that she had been struggling with anxiety and depression over the last few years. Speaking after his final round at the Tour Championship -- where he finished tied for 14th -- McIlroy said that he had faced similar difficulties in his own career.

"Taliban tells Berlin it will welcome German companies, aid",2461,"BERLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban would welcome German investment in Afghanistan and help in areas including humanitarian aid, health care, education and infrastructure, the group's spokesman told Bild newspaper. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month as foreign forces pulled out after a 20-year mission, and the country is facing an economic collapse and humanitarian crisis while donors and governments weigh up how to deal with the new leaders. Germany, acting in concert with the European Union, has laid out conditions to resume a diplomatic presence in Kabul and unfreeze development aid, urging the Taliban to respect human rights, particularly those of women. read more ""The German government could encourage its entrepreneurs to come and invest in our country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an interview with Bild published on Monday. The Taliban would pave the way for investments and ensure companies' security, he said. Germany maintained close relations with Afghanistan in the past and after the fall of the first Taliban government in 2001 hosted a conference in Bonn that was supposed to lay the foundation for a democratic Afghanistan. The hardline Islamist group has sought to present a more moderate face this time. read more ""We would like to revive the friendly atmosphere that existed between Afghans and Germans. The next government will be based on a friendly relationship with Germany,"" Mujahid said. ""We would like Germany to support us in the humanitarian sector, and we need help in the health care sector, in the area of education and with the infrastructure,"" he added He also said the Taliban would be ""very happy"" to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel - who is about to step down as Germany's leader - for a visit in Afghanistan. German citizens living in the country and Afghans who have cooperated with Germany in the past should not be afraid of the Taliban and there would be no problems, Mujahid said. Those among them who wanted to leave the country will have to take the legal route, he added.

McIlroy lends support to Osaka over decision to take break,1589,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Golfer Rory McIlroy has backed Naomi Osaka's decision to take a break from tennis following the Japanese world number three's elimination from the U.S. Open last week, saying that it was important that athletes did not let results define them. A tearful Osaka told reporters that she would be taking some time off from the sport after crashing out in the third round at Flushing Meadows to 19-year-old Leylah Fernandez, adding that she had been struggling with anxiety and depression over the last few years. Speaking after his final round at the Tour Championship -- where he finished tied for 14th -- McIlroy said that he had faced similar difficulties in his own career. ""I spoke about this in 2019 about separating who I am as a golfer and who I am as a person and trying to not let that define me, and it seems what Naomi is going through at the minute is that same thing,"" said the four-time major winner. ""How can I play tennis and enjoy it and not let the results define who I am... I think everyone just needs to let her have time to figure that out."" Osaka has received support from various athletes, including tennis greats Billie Jean King and Boris Becker, as well former American sprinter Michael Johnson, with many praising her for bringing to the fore a new discussion around mental health. read more McIlroy added: ""She seems like a really smart girl, and hopefully she'll be able to do it and come back and start enjoying the game just like when she picked the racket up when she was a little girl.""

"Taliban tells Berlin it will welcome German companies, aid",2461,"BERLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban would welcome German investment in Afghanistan and help in areas including humanitarian aid, health care, education and infrastructure, the group's spokesman told Bild newspaper. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month as foreign forces pulled out after a 20-year mission, and the country is facing an economic collapse and humanitarian crisis while donors and governments weigh up how to deal with the new leaders. Germany, acting in concert with the European Union, has laid out conditions to resume a diplomatic presence in Kabul and unfreeze development aid, urging the Taliban to respect human rights, particularly those of women. read more ""The German government could encourage its entrepreneurs to come and invest in our country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an interview with Bild published on Monday. The Taliban would pave the way for investments and ensure companies' security, he said. Germany maintained close relations with Afghanistan in the past and after the fall of the first Taliban government in 2001 hosted a conference in Bonn that was supposed to lay the foundation for a democratic Afghanistan. The hardline Islamist group has sought to present a more moderate face this time. read more ""We would like to revive the friendly atmosphere that existed between Afghans and Germans. The next government will be based on a friendly relationship with Germany,"" Mujahid said. ""We would like Germany to support us in the humanitarian sector, and we need help in the health care sector, in the area of education and with the infrastructure,"" he added He also said the Taliban would be ""very happy"" to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel - who is about to step down as Germany's leader - for a visit in Afghanistan. German citizens living in the country and Afghans who have cooperated with Germany in the past should not be afraid of the Taliban and there would be no problems, Mujahid said. Those among them who wanted to leave the country will have to take the legal route, he added.

Sinovac booster shot reverses drop in antibody activities against Delta-study,2054,"BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - A booster dose of Sinovac Biotech's (SVA.O) COVID-19 vaccine reversed a decline in antibody activities against the Delta variant, a study showed, easing some concerns about its longer-term immune response to the highly contagious strain of the virus. The study comes amid concerns about the Chinese vaccine's efficacy against Delta, which has become the dominant variant globally and is driving a surge in new infections even in the most vaccinated countries. Several countries which have relied heavily on the Sinovac vaccine have begun giving booster shots developed by Western manufacturers to people fully vaccinated with the Chinese shot. Neutralising antibody activities against Delta were not detected in samples taken from vaccine recipients six months after they received the second dose of Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine, according to the study published on Sunday before a peer review. But recipients of booster shots showed over 2.5-fold higher neutralizing potency against Delta about four weeks after the third dose, compared with the level seen about four weeks after the second shot, researchers from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Furan University, Sinovac, and other Chinese institutions said in the paper. They did not discuss how specifically changes in antibody activity will affect Sinovac shot's efficacy in preventing people from getting sick from the variant. The lab study involves samples from 66 participants, including 38 volunteers who received either two or three doses of the vaccine. The World Health Organization plans to ship around 100 million doses of the Sinovac and Sinopharm COVID-19 shots by the end of this month, mostly to Africa and Asia, in its first delivery of Chinese vaccines. But some countries rejected accepting the vaccines, citing lack of data on their effectiveness against Delta. read more Around 1.8 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been supplied globally including China by end August, according to the company.

India's Hetero gets emergency use nod to make Roche's COVID-19 drug,1166,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Indian drug developer Hetero said on Monday it has received emergency use approval from the country's health authorities to make a generic version of Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) COVID-19 drug. Hetero expects to make the treatment, tocilizumab, available in India by the end of the month under the brand name Tocira. Tocilizumab has been facing a global shortage as the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant drives up cases in several countries. COVID-19 cases in India have declined from levels hit during the second wave in April and May, although health experts believe that the country should brace for a third wave by October.

Brazil v Argentina suspended after health officials intervene over quarantine breach,4886,"SAO PAULO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A World Cup qualifier between Argentina and Brazil was suspended amid farcical scenes on Sunday after Brazilian health authorities accused a number of Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Tottenham duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentine line-up when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa invaded the pitch and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. The trio, along with Aston Villa’s Emiliano Buendia, who was in the stands, had reportedly breached Brazilian rules stating that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country, unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. The regulations were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 583,000 Brazilians. While the visitingteam quickly left the field, the two coaches, along with Argentina captain Lionel Messi and the Brazilian players, gathered at the side of the pitch to discuss the stoppage. ""Why did they start the game and stop it after five minutes?"" Messi said in comments heard on television. ""We've been here at the stadium for an hour, they could have told us."" Messi then returned to the dressing room and at 5pm local time, an hour after the game kicked off, the match was officially suspended. “The referee and the match official will take a report to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and they will decide what steps to take,” said a statement issued by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Anvisa said they had issued ample warnings that the four Argentines were in contravention of Brazilian health regulations. Argentine officials were told on Saturday the four should isolate and when the instructions were ignored, Anvisa asked Brazilian federal police to enforce the isolation ruling on Sunday morning, the regulator said. Their attempts were ""frustrated,"" Anvisa said in a statement issued late on Sunday. Brazilian Football Confederation president said he was “indignant” with the scenes that reverberated around the football world. Ednaldo Rodrigues criticised Anvisa and said officials told him the Argentines who breached the country's COVID-19 rules could have been deported after the game. Soccer Football - World Cup - South American Qualifiers - Brazil v Argentina - Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo, Brazil - September 5, 2021 Players and officials are seen on the pitch as play is interrupted after Brazilian health officials objected to the participation of three Argentine players they say broke quarantine rules REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli “I feel sorry for all the sports fans who wanted to watch the game on television,” he told Brazil’s Sportv. “With all due respect to Anvisa, they could have resolved this earlier and not waited for the game to start.” A shellshocked Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni agreed. “It makes me so sad, I am not looking for guilty parties, whatever happened or didn’t happen, this wasn’t the time to do it,” he told Argentine broadcaster TyC Sports. “We wanted to enjoy a game between the best in the world and it ends up like this.” “As a coach I am going to defend my players. If people come and say we want to take this guy or deport this guy there was no chance of that,"" he said. ""Because at no time were we told we couldn't play the game."" Argentine officials believed the same protocols used in the Copa America in Brazil in June were in place for the World Cup qualifiers to allow teams to travel across the continent. CONMEBOL confirmed that interpretation. FALSE DETAILS In a statement Anvisa said it had received reports that the four Argentine players had provided “false information” on their pre-flight health declarations. ""Anvisa considers the situation a serious health risk and so has asked local health authorities to determine the immediate quarantine of the players, who are stopped from participating in any activity and should be prevented from remaining on Brazilian soil,"" Anvisa said in a statement. The confusion comes amid continuing anger in South America at rules which have robbed several teams of key players for this month’s three World Cup qualifiers. Brazil were without nine key men for Argentina game, and other South American sides have also lost players due to a decision by some European clubs not to let their players travel to the continent. They would have had to quarantine when they returned to Europe and the clubs do not want to lose their players for subsequent league games. Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina. The top four qualify automatically for Qatar.

"Florida gunman kills 4 including baby, wounds 11-year-old girl",2303,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - A self-described survivalist in body armor shot and killed four people, including a woman and her 3-month-old baby boy in her arms, before surrendering to police in central Florida on Sunday, officials said. The shooter, identified as Bryan Riley, 33, a former U.S. Marine, also wounded an 11-year-old girl who underwent surgery for seven gunshot injuries, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told a news conference. Riley, who had no connection to the victims, engaged in a shootout with police before giving up, and later tried to grab a police officer's gun while being treated in the hospital for his own gunshot wound, before being subdued again, Judd said. A veteran of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Riley was working as a bodyguard and a security guard. His girlfriend of four years told investigators he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and occasional depression, Judd said. About a week ago his mental health worsened and he told his girlfriend he had started speaking with God, Judd said. ""He said at one point to our detectives, 'They begged for their lives and I killed them anyway',"" Judd said at a second news conference. Riley also told sheriff's deputies he was high on methamphetamine, Judd said. The shooter first appeared randomly at the house where the shooting occurred on Saturday night, making nonsensical statements, but left by the time police responded. He returned early Sunday morning, killing a 40-year-old man, the 33-year-old mother and her baby boy, Judd said. In the home next door, he also killed the 62-year-old mother of the woman, Judd said. ""In addition to that, if he's not evil enough, he shot and killed the family dog,"" Judd said. Deputies responding to reports of two volleys of automatic gunfire arrived to find the suspect unarmed outside, wearing camouflage and body armor. Riley then went back inside and ""we heard another volley, and a woman scream, and a baby whimper,"" Judd said. A gunfight ensued before he came out unarmed and was arrested. ""It would have been nice if he would have come out with a gun ... We would have shot him up a lot. But he didn't because he was a coward,"" Judd said. ""When someone chooses to give up, we take them into custody peacefully."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Each COVID-19 surge poses a risk for healthcare workers: PTSD,5513,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - Nurse Chris Prott's knees jump, his heart races, his mouth goes dry and his mind floods with dark memories when he talks about working in the Milwaukee VA Medical Center's intensive care unit (ICU) during pandemic surges. Prott shares a struggle common to many of the military veterans for whom he has cared for years: symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prott was among a half dozen ICU staffers who told Reuters of symptoms such as waking from nightmares bathed in sweat; flashbacks to dying patients during the pandemic's fear-filled early days; flaring anger; and panic at the sound of medical alarms. Those whose symptoms last longer than one month and are severe enough to interfere with daily life can be diagnosed with PTSD. The surging Delta variant is heaping on fresh trauma as the United States and other nations begin to study PTSD in health workers. Data already showed that U.S. health workers were in crisis before COVID-19. While PTSD is associated with combat, it can arise among civilians after natural disasters, abuse or other trauma. Health workers can be reluctant to equate their experience with that of returning soldiers. ""I feel like a schmuck calling it PTSD,"" Prott said. ""It took me a long time to be able to talk to somebody because I see guys with real PTSD. What I've got going on, it's nothing in comparison, so you feel guilty for thinking that."" Psychiatrist Dr. Bessel van der Kolk knows better. ""On the surface, a nurse at your local hospital will not look like a guy coming back from Afghanistan,"" said the author of ""The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma."" ""But underneath it all, we have these core neurobiology-determined functions that are the same."" Pre-pandemic studies showed that rates of PTSD in front-line health workers varied from 10% to 50%. The suicide rate among doctors was more than twice that of the general public. The American Medical Association (AMA) has tapped a military psychologist and the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Center for PTSD to help it measure the pandemic's impact. Texas Tech University Health Science Center psychiatry resident Dr. Huseyin Bayazit and researchers in his native Turkey surveyed 1,833 Turkish health workers last autumn. The results, presented in May at an American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed a PTSD rate of 49.5% among nonphysicians and 36% for doctors. Rates of suicidal thoughts increased as workers spent more time on COVID-19 units. Unions want to mitigate trauma by setting national rules for the number of patients under each nurse’s care. Workers say they should not have to pay for therapy, medication, and other interventions. Nurse Chris Prott examines a patient in the urgent care department at the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, U.S., August 25, 2021. John Jamison/Handout via REUTERS The AMA and other groups want more confidentiality for doctors who seek mental health services. Most ICU staff who discussed PTSD with Reuters requested anonymity for fear of repercussions at work. New York's Mount Sinai Health System and Chicago's Rush University System for Health provide free, confidential mental health services. Mount Sinai's new Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth offers a military-inspired ""Battle Buddies"" peer-support program for nurses. A chaplain from Rush's ""Road Home"" program for veterans runs a ""post-traumatic growth"" bereavement support group for ICU nurses. The VA system provides no-cost, short-term mental health counseling through its employee assistance program. Many local VA facilities supplement those with spiritual counseling and crisis incident response teams, a spokesperson said. 'YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT' About 5,000 U.S. physicians quit every two years due to burnout, said Dr. Christine Sinsky, an AMA vice president. The annual cost is about $4.6 billion - including lost revenue from vacancies and recruitment expenses, she said. Hospital survey results in March led the Department of Health and Human Services to warn ""staffing shortages have affected patient care, and that exhaustion and trauma have taken a toll on staff's mental health."" Trauma surgeon Dr. Kari Jerge volunteered to work in a Phoenix COVID-19 ward during last winter's surge. She turned down substantially more pay to return to the ICU after the Delta variant surge. Jerge encourages others to prioritize ""self-preservation,"" but worries about the loss of expertise. ""There is infinite value in a nurse who's been working in the ICU for 20 years and just has a gut feeling when something's going wrong with a patient,"" she said. Nurse Pascaline Muhindura, 40, who cares for COVID-19 patients in Kansas City, Missouri, has advocated for health worker safety since losing a co-worker to the disease early in the pandemic. ""It keeps getting worse and worse. We are heading back to that place - that woke up those emotions again,"" said Muhindura, who added that many employers do not offer adequate insurance coverage for therapy. An ICU fosters the kind of camaraderie forged in battle. A group of Southern California COVID-19 nurses got matching tattoos. Health workers commiserate over crying their way home after tough shifts, support each other on social media, and push colleagues to seek help. ""There is nothing wrong with feeling this way,"" said VA nurse Prott. ""You have to deal with it though."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel to present COVID-19 booster shot data to FDA experts,1619,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Israel this month will present data from an extensive rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is weighing White House plans to begin a booster drive in the United States. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said the ministry had been asked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to brief its advisors at a Sept. 17 meeting. The virtual session will consider a third booster shot of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) vaccine, and may discuss others. read more ""We have been asked to come and present Israel's experience and our data so that we can truly help the whole world to learn,"" Alroy-Preis told Israeli Channel 12 TV news. A week ago Israel began offering a Pfizer COVID-19 booster to people as young as 12 in a campaign that began in July among seniors. Israeli health officials said the drive has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant. Officials have said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine waned five months after administration, making a booster necessary. A third dose, they said, restored the level of protection of the second shot. So far 2.6 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden had been expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20.

Column: Crafty lawyering on Texas abortion bill withstood SCOTUS challenge: Greene,5807,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sept 4 (Reuters) - Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, abortion opponents have been trying to scale back or undo it. Texas state senator Bryan Hughes, a former personal injury lawyer and author of the “Heartbeat Act,” led a team in succeeding, at least for now, where so many others have failed. As a social policy, the law, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in Texas but leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, is deeply controversial. House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said it “delivers catastrophe to women in Texas.” Still, some supporters stress that Hughes and the co-architects of the law, which included former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, deserve credit for what amounts to creative lawyering in drafting the measure, known as SB 8. These lawyers figured out how to apply qui tam statutes, which allow private citizens to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of the government, to receive an award in the abortion law context. Hughes, 52, in an interview said the new law “is a very elegant use of the judicial system.” The impetus for creating the unique state-wide legislation came after district attorneys around the country, including some in Texas, publicly stated they would not enforce laws that criminalized early abortions, said Hughes, a Republican from Mineola, Texas. His conclusion? “We had to find another way.” As a lawyer and legislator, he was familiar with qui tam statutes such as the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, which allows private citizens to bring a fraud case and collect a bounty. “The concept was there,” Hughes said. SB 8’s enforcement mechanism also was modeled after an anti-abortion ordinance enacted by the town of Waskom, Texas, in 2019, Hughes said. The ordinance also delegates enforcement to private citizens bringing lawsuits. Mitchell, a former law clerk to the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, provided legal advice to anti-abortion advocates in drafting the ordinance, which was copied by about 30 other cities across the state. He declined to comment. “We continued to refine it,” Hughes said of the Waskom law. ""Lots of lawyers and law professors helped us out,” including Mitchell, whom he describes as a longtime friend and a “very sharp guy.” To John Seago, legislative director of anti-abortion advocacy group Texas Right to Life, the novelty of SB 8 “was that it expands who has standing and takes out the other (criminal) penalties and prohibits state action.” Under the statute, Texas officials have no authority to enforce the new law, which bars abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Private citizens alone are empowered to sue women and anyone who assists them for violating the ban. That private citizen component of the law was key in thwarting the abortion-provider plaintiffs, on procedural grounds, from winning an injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court. The defendants whom the abortion providers had named in the injunction action included a state court judge and a private citizen who allegedly threatened to sue women for seeking abortions. But as the high court majority noted, it's not clear that any of them ""can or will seek to enforce the Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might permit our intervention."" The private citizen, Mark Lee Dickson, said in an affidavit that he has no present intention to try to enforce the law, and no cases are before the judge. So who could the court seek to stop? According to both Hughes and Seago, no one has attempted to sue anyone for performing or assisting in a post-heartbeat abortion since the law went into effect on Sept. 1. Until someone does, SB 8 seems likely to stay on the books, shielded from judicial review. A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred Texas Right to Life from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce the new law. Still, SB 8 won’t get a free pass forever. The five-justice majority wrote that their decision “in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.” It just might take awhile. In crafting the legislation, Hughes, who was elected to the state senate in 2016 and served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years prior, said he drew on his legal background. “Usually in politics, being a lawyer is a negative, but it does come in handy sometimes,"" he said. From 2003 to 2008, Hughes was a litigator at The Lanier Law Firm, which has scored billions of dollars in verdicts for plaintiffs in cases involving hip implants, diabetes medication and talcum powder. Founder Mark Lanier in an email described Hughes as “a gifted lawyer strongly motivated by what he thinks is right.” (This story corrects who can be sued under the Texas abortion law.

Spanish village hosts first bull running fiesta since pandemic,1615,"VILLASECA DE LA SAGRA, SPAIN, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Ten bulls charged through the streets of Villaseca de la Sagra on Sunday in pursuit of hundreds of runners as the first bull running fiesta was held in Spain since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Villages and towns across Spain hold the fiestas but they were prohibited last year as the country brought in tough health restrictions. Opposition to them has increased in recent years as Spanish society remains divided over the controversial issue of using bulls for sport. No-one was injured during the country's first run, in this village of 1,700 inhabitants which is 65 km (41 miles) south of Madrid.

""We were very excited. There were plenty of controls. If people respect restrictions, we can do this all over Spain,"" said Fernando Dominguez, 45, a market worker from Madrid. A 2020 poll, published by the survey company Electomania, found that 47% Spaniards backed banning bullfighting while 18.6% opposed prohibition and 37% opposed bullfighting but did not want it to be banned.

Vietnam sets deadline to vaccinate biggest cities' adults,1709,"HANOI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre, Ho Chi Minh City, and capital Hanoi must vaccinate all of their adult residents with at least one shot by Sept. 15, the ministry of health said on Sunday. Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.3% of the country's 98 million people fully vaccinated with two shots, and 15.4% with one shot. The country is battling a worsening COVID-19 outbreak that has infected more than 520,000 people and killed 13,000, the vast majority in the past few months. Ho Chi Minh City, the country's business hub, accounts for half of the infections and 80% of the fatalities. The cities must ""mobilise all capable forces including private medical facilities, to vaccinate people at full capacity"", the ministry said in an emergency dispatch. Government data showed 88% of Ho Chi Minh City's adult population of 6.97 million have been inoculated with at least one shot. The rate is 53% for Hanoi's adult population of 5.75 million. The ministry also set the Sept. 15 deadline for the southern industrial provinces of Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long An to vaccinate all of their adult populations. It said Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong and Long An have been allocated enough vaccine doses for the vaccination drive. Vietnam has so far received 33 million coronavirus vaccine doses, and it expects to receive 17 million more by the end of this month, the government said late on Sunday.

All six Israel MPC members voted to keep rates unchanged-minutes,2367,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - All six rate setters at the Bank of Israel voted to keep the benchmark interest rate (ILINR=ECI) at 0.1% on Aug. 23, though one member believed it may be time to start tightening policy, minutes of the discussions showed on Sunday. For the second straight meeting, the monetary policy committee voted 6-0 to leave rates unchanged. The economy rebounded in the second quarter after most COVID-related restrictions were lifted, while inflation moved near a 2% rate. One member, the minutes said, was of the opinion that the strong economic data and the increase in the inflation environment ""could have made it possible to begin gradually reducing the extent of monetary policy accommodation"". ""However in view of the renewed increase in morbidity it is best to be very cautious and at this time to retain the current policy,"" the minutes said, citing the view of the policymaker. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualised 15.4% in the April-June period from the prior three months, while the inflation rate reached 1.9% in July from below zero earlier in 2021. Yet, COVID-19 infections from the Delta variant have spiked in recent weeks, despite a rapid vaccination rollout in which many adults have already received a third shot although with the number of serious cases fairly low, officials are reluctant to impose a fourth lockdown. ""The Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity, in view of the increased health risks in Israel and abroad,"" the minutes said. ""Therefore, the (MPC) will continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary."" Policymakers noted ""there are no signs of an outbreak of inflation"" even though prices of non-tradable items continue to rise, while the rate of increase in prices of tradable goods was stable. At the same time, MPC members noted that economic activity returned to its long term trend in most industries but tourism, hospitality and culture continued to struggle. ""The committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for the process of exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function,"" the minutes showed.

UK minister: no decision yet on COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children,2054,"LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday said a decision had not yet been taken on whether healthy children aged 12- to 15-years-old should be vaccinated against COVID-19, following reports that a rollout could begin in the coming days. Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday declined to recommend vaccinations for children in that group, taking a precautionary approach due to a rare risk of heart inflammation, but adding the issue was finely balanced. read more The government is consulting medical advisers to seek advice on wider considerations, such as the impact on schools, and may still give the go-ahead to broad vaccination of the age group. Some newspapers reported confidence among ministers that the chief medical officers would swiftly back shots for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, but Zahawi said the government would not prejudge the decision. ""No decision will be made until we hear back from the chief medical officers,"" Zahawi told the BBC. Children are being widely vaccinated already in the United States, Israel and many European countries. British officials have emphasised that 12- to 15-year-olds who are vulnerable to COVID-19 are already eligible for vaccination, as well as all people over 16. The four nations of the United Kingdom, which have recorded 133,000 COVID deaths, control their own health policy, although all have followed JCVI advice on vaccine rollout thus far. Zahawi confirmed that proof of vaccination would be required in England for some large events from the end of this month once all adults have been offered two shots. read more He also said that the government was still finalising plans for a vaccine booster programme following interim advice from the JCVI that one might be needed for the vulnerable and elderly. read more ""It is very likely that we will begin boosting those groups, as... I hope the interim then becomes final advice, by the middle of this month,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand tried to deport attacker for years after he arrived as refugee,3607,"WELLINGTON/COLOMBO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - New Zealand had tried for years to deport the knife-wielding militant who wounded seven people at a mall in Auckland last week, the government said after it released more details on the attacker following the lifting of a court suppression order. Court documents made public on Sunday identified the attacker as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, an ethnic Tamil Muslim from Sri Lanka. He had arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago on a student visa seeking refugee status, which was granted in 2013. Police in Sri Lanka were making background checks on Samsudeen and talking to his family and friends for more information, said spokesperson Nalin Thalduwa. ""As far as I am aware the New Zealand government has not made a formal request for Sri Lanka to commence an investigation so we are simply gathering information at the moment,"" Thalduwa said. New Zealand police were following Samsudeen and shot him dead about a minute after he launched his attack on Friday after picking up a knife from a supermarket display. He had been convicted and imprisoned for about three years before being released in July. Samsudeen's family issued a statement to the New Zealand media describing their shock at the ""terrible event"". After his arrest Samsudeen ""used to call me once every three months or so. We felt his change and everyone used to scold him, especially his two bothers,"" his mother, who lives in the Muslim-majority town of Kattankudy on Sri Lanka's eastern coast, told a local news channel. Samsudeen was inspired by the Islamic State militant group and was being monitored constantly but he could not be kept in prison by law any longer, the New Zealand government has said. He came to the attention of the police and security services in 2016 after he expressed sympathy on Facebook for militant attacks, violent war-related videos and comments advocating violent extremism. The authorities say they later discovered his refugee status was fraudulently obtained, so the government sought to cancel his visa and issued deportation notices. But Samsudeen appealed against the deportation, and since he was in prison, his appeal could not proceed until his criminal trial ended in May this year. The attack has led to questions about a loophole in New Zealand's counterterrorism laws that allowed Samsudeen to remain free despite authorities being aware of the threat he posed. The government has promised to tighten the law, in particular to criminalise planning a militant attack. ""We will continue to review our immigration laws alongside the terrorist suppression law, and I'm sure if there are ways we can improve it, we will,"" Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told a news conference. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on Saturday that unsuccessful attempts to deport Samsudeen were a ""frustrating process"" for the government. Of the seven people wounded in the attack three are in critical condition. One has been released from hospital. Samsudeen's family said in the statement they were heartbroken. ""We hope to find out with you all, what happened in Aathil's case and what we all could have done to prevent this,"" the family said in the statement, released by his brother Aroos. The family said Samsudeen was suffering from mental health problems and his condition got worse over the past 10 years as he spent more time in prison and dealing with court cases. ""He wanted to share the sufferings and injustices. He saw himself as someone fighting those injustices,"" the family said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Brazil health regulator suspends use of 12 mln Sinovac vaccine shots,1397,"SAO PAULO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Brazil's federal health regulator Anvisa on Saturday suspended the use of over 12 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) that were produced in an unauthorized plant, it said in a statement. Anvisa said it was alerted on Friday by Sao Paulo's Butantan institute, a biomedical center that has partnered with Sinovac to locally fill and finish the vaccines, that 25 batches, or 12.1 million doses, sent to Brazil had been made in the plant. ""The manufacturing unit ... was not inspected and was not approved by Anvisa in the authorization of emergency use of the mentioned vaccine,"" the regulator said.

Hurricane Ida death toll in Louisiana rises to 12,3239,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida's toll rose to 12 storm deaths in Louisiana on Saturday, still far outpaced by the dozens killed in flooded Northeast U.S. states where President Biden is heading next week to assess damage. New York and New Jersey were among the four northern states that started the Labor Day holiday weekend digging through debris left by the deadly deluge that killed more than 44 people and caused public transportation in New York City to grind to a halt. Transportation operators promised to restore some lines before the start of the workweek on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden will visit storm-ravaged New Jersey and New York on Tuesday, just days after he traveled to hard-hit Louisiana where the storm made landfall almost a week ago. His Northeast travels will include Manville, New Jersey, and the Queens borough of New York City, the White House said. read more The confirmed storm-related death toll in Louisiana rose to 12 on Saturday, Governor Bel Edwards told a news conference. He warned those numbers could increase because so many people are relying on power from generators, which were blamed for four carbon monoxide deaths among the 12 deaths, the governor said. More than 718,500 customers in Louisiana are still without power, down from the 1.1 million people that Hurricane Ida's devastation initially left in the dark, the governor said. After Biden mentioned the possibility of using a cruise ship to house workers trying to restore power, the Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line said it would deploy its Grand Classica flagship to New Orleans to house 1,500 front line workers under a charter agreement with Entergy Corp. “Hurricane relief and humanitarian charters are something we’ve done several times in the past, and we are proud to be able to move quickly to action now in this way, helping facilitate relief for the thousands of people who remain without power across the region,"" Kevin Sheehan, president of the cruise line, said in a statement. Two new deaths in Louisiana were among evacuated nursing home residents at a Tangipahoa Parish warehouse now under state investigation after reports of squalid conditions. ""Sadly, we also can now confirm 2 additional deaths among nursing home residents who had been evacuated to the Tangipahoa facility,"" the Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Saturday. ""This brings the death toll of nursing home residents evacuated to this facility to 6,"" the health department tweeted.

AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. companies including Lyft Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and Silicon Laboratories Inc voiced their displeasure on Friday at new Texas laws on abortion, handguns, and voting limitations, a fresh sign of increased efforts by some firms to signal their commitment to social responsibility. Lyft (LYFT.O) and Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) said they will cover all legal fees for the ride-hail companies' drivers sued under a law that puts in place a near-total ban on abortion. Lyft will also donate $1 million to women's health provider Planned Parenthood, chief executive Logan Green said on Twitter. ""This is an attack on women's access to healthcare and on their right to choose,"" Green said of the new Texas law. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted in response to Green's announcement that his company would cover drivers' legal fees in the same way, thanking Green for taking the initiative. The ban, which took effect Wednesday, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. This potentially includes drivers who unknowingly take women to clinics for abortion procedures. The Lyft Driver Hub is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 20, 2019. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson On Wednesday, Tinder-owner Match Group's (MTCH.O) CEO and rival dating platform Bumble Inc (BMBL.O) said they were setting up funds to help Texas-based employees seeking abortion care outside the state. Website hosting service GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) on Friday, meanwhile, shut down a Texas anti-abortion website that allowed people to report suspected abortions. The reaction to the law change in Texas comes at a time when many companies are seeking to burnish their corporate and environmental governance credentials with consumers. Companies also reacted to the Texas legislature this week passing the final version of a bill that outlaws drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and gives poll watchers more power, widely seen as restricting voting access. ""We hoped for a different outcome for this legislation, and we're disappointed by this result,"" an American Airlines (AAL.O) spokesperson said in an email. A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N), based in Texas, said, ""As a global company of 60,000 team members, HPE encourages our team members to engage in the political process where they live and work and make their voices heard through advocacy and at the voting booth."" Meanwhile, a law allowing people to carry concealed handguns without any permit went into effect in Texas on Wednesday. ""Looking at the abortion law, or the gun law, or the voting law, it's a form of vigilante justice, where you're empowering individuals to enforce the law,"" said Tyson Tuttle, the CEO of Austin-based Silicon Laboratories (SLAB.O). ""It's been a rough week in Texas and a harbinger of what's to come across the country."""

""I feel like I'm kind of at this point where I'm trying to figure out what I want to do. Honestly I don't know when I'm going to play my next tennis match,"" she said, breaking down in tears at a post-match press conference and pulling the brim of her visor over her eyes. ""I think I'm going to take a break from playing for a while."" Playing in her first Grand Slam since pulling out of the French Open earlier this year and disclosing her battle with depression, Osaka's return to Flushing Meadows did not go to plan, as she wordlessly left the court after uncharacteristically losing her cool in the second set tiebreak. The third seed whacked her racquet and then flung it onto the court twice in frustration as Fernandez scored five straight points in the tiebreak, in a series of superb play. Osaka did not receive a warning or a code violation and left the court between sets, later telling reporters she struggled to contain her emotions. ""I'm really sorry about that,"" she said. ""I was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point. ""Like normally I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don't go my way, and I feel like you can feel that. I'm not really sure why it happens the way it happens now.""

In the ninth game Osaka rushed through her serves, not even waiting for the crowd to quiet down, as she was unable to create a single break point opportunity in the final set. A fan favourite, Osaka has struggled with uneven play since she withdrew from Roland Garros earlier this year amid a public row with tournament officials over required media appearances, which she said had a negative impact on her mental health. She told fans that she has struggled with depression for years, prompting new discussion around mental health in professional sport. ""How do I go around saying this? I feel like for me recently, like, when I win I don't feel happy. I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad, said Osaka. ""I don't think that's normal."" FERNANDEZ BREAKTHROUGH It was a breakthrough performance for Fernandez, who reached the fourth round of a major for the first time just a few days shy of her 19th birthday. She fired off 28 winners across the three sets, and said in a televised interview that she worked at ""just finding the solutions"" during the match. ""She's a great server, she's been hitting aces left, right and centre,"" Fernandez said of Osaka. She told reporters she was able to rely on in her own serve, as well, as she won more than three quarters of her first-serve points and fired off six aces. ""I've been serving really well the past few matches. Today I just went on court with a lot of confidence on my serve, trusting it, trusting that I'm going to hit my targets when I needed to, and I did,"" she said.

Beef giant Brazil halts China exports after confirming two mad cow disease cases,1688,"SAO PAULO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, has suspended beef exports to its No. 1 customer China after confirming two cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease in two separate domestic meat plants, the agriculture ministry said on Saturday. The suspension, which is part of an animal health pact agreed between China and Brazil and is designed to allow Beijing time to take stock of the problem, begins immediately, the ministry said in a statement. China will decide when to begin importing again, it added. The suspension is a major blow for Brazilian farmers: China and Hong Kong buy more than half of Brazil's beef exports. The cases were identified in meat plants in the states of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais, the ministry said. It said they were the fourth and fifth cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease that have been detected in Brazil in 23 years. It said ""atypical"" mad cow disease develops spontaneously and is not related to eating contaminated foods. Brazil has never had a case of ""classic"" mad cow disease, it said. The two cases were confirmed on Friday after samples were sent to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lab in Alberta, Canada, the ministry said. The OIE had subsequently been informed of the two cases, in compliance with international norms, the ministry said. The ministry said there was no risk to animal or human health. Brazil's government will hope the suspension is lifted quickly. The country's powerful agribusiness sector is one of the main drivers of its long-lagging economy.

Thai PM survives no confidence vote as more anti-government protests planned,1824,"BANGKOK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and five cabinet ministers comfortably survived a vote of no confidence in parliament on Saturday as activists planned more protests against the government. Prayuth received 264 votes in favour and 208 against. Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and four other cabinet ministers also survived the censure motion in similar fashion. The opposition needed 242 of the 482 parliamentary votes to oust the prime minister. Prayuth said he remained confident after the vote. Lawmakers over four days accused his government of mishandling the pandemic and criticised him for the severe economic impact, taking aim at the government’s slow vaccine rollout as a result of not making advance vaccine orders and deciding not to join the international COVAX vaccine-supply scheme. Prayuth has stood by those decisions. This is the third censure motion the government has survived and comes as pro-democracy protesters plan more demonstrations on Saturday. Recent rallies have turned violent, with security forces using tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets against protesters who threw stones and firecrackers. Thailand has reported over 1.2 million infections and over 12,000 coronavirus-related deaths, most of them since April due to the Delta variant. Authorities reported the largest single-day increase in cases in mid-August with over 23,000 cases. The vaccine rollout began in June amid the country's most severe outbreak, with people unable to find medical treatment and some dying at home. About 13% of Thailand's more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated. The government cut its 2021 economic growth forecast for a third time, to 0.7%-1.2% from 1.5%-2.5%.

""It's just so good to be among so many people again. Let's hope it can set the example for other events to be allowed as well."" The grand prix, the first in the Netherlands in 36 years, is the country's first mass event since the pandemic arrived, with music festivals and other cultural events still limited to tiny audiences to limit the spread of the disease. This apparently uneven treatment has already sparked criticism in recent weeks, and images of thousands of people thronging the pathways at the race circuit fuelled the discontent on Friday, as many artists took to social media to express their anger. But health minister Hugo de Jonge said no exceptions were made for the grand prix, as the event followed the rules for hosting a large crowd, meaning all spectators needed a negative COVID-19 test to get in and had to remain in their assigned seats as much as possible. ""But there is friction between the rules and the reality on the ground"", De Jonge said, commenting on the masses of people who were clearly not in their seats. ""We can't avoid crowded situations. But we will manage the flow better and are asking people to remain in their seats longer"", Dutch GP spokesman Simon Keijzer said on Saturday. This did not prevent big crowds forming again, however, as soon as the Formula One drivers left the track and fans went looking for food, drinks and toilets. The rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has kept infections in the Netherlands relatively high in recent weeks, forcing the government to reinforce several social distancing measures last month. It also limited the grand prix to two-thirds of its original capacity of 105,000 tickets for visitors per day. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. seen funding humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, but not its government",3131,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is likely to finance U.N. and other agencies providing humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan but there is virtually no chance it will directly fund a new Taliban-led government, congressional aides said on Friday. The United States has been a massive funder of Afghanistan since its 2001 invasion to topple the Taliban, setting aside roughly $130 billion for security, governance and development and humanitarian needs. Aides to the Democrats who control both houses of Congress and to Republicans said lawmakers were nearly certain to provide humanitarian aid for internally displaced Afghans and refugees but not to the government itself, at least for now. ""It would be difficult to convince members of Congress to do anything that would appear to be supporting the Taliban government,"" said a senior Senate Democratic aide, citing the absence of oversight and a reluctance ""to support a government that is anathema to us."" A senior Senate Republican aide concurred. ""Republicans would absolutely not support giving money to the Taliban,"" the Republican aide said, saying they do not want to provide any money until Americans and Afghans who worked with the United States can leave Afghanistan. While aides said there was an understanding that agencies such as the World Food Program and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would need funds, the Republican said lawmakers would want strict conditions on how it is spent. ""There needs to be a distinct look at what this is going to look like and how this is going to flow,"" he said. For fiscal 2022 starting Oct. 1, Congress set aside $136.45 million in the Economic Support Fund, which the Democratic aide said was the source for underwriting Afghan government salaries, and $52.03 million for Afghan humanitarian aid, according to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. The aides all but ruled out contributing to the salaries of Afghan civil servants who, working under a Taliban-led government, might oversee such basic services as running schools, health clinics and hospitals. ""I find it hard to imagine that happening, in part because how would we know that the funds weren't ending up in the wrong hands?"" said the senior Senate Democratic aide. The aide said Congress might appropriate as much as the $144 million to $279 million it has set aside annually in the last decade for Afghan humanitarian needs, depending on what U.N. agencies and others determine is required. The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether it would request additional funds for Afghanistan. Taliban sources said the group's co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would lead a new government set to be announced soon. Its first task may be to stave off the collapse of an economy grappling with drought and the ravages of a 20-year war. read more Taliban fighters entered Kabul on Aug. 15.

"Florida teachers on edge as mask war, COVID surge mark first weeks of school",2556,"HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept 4 (Reuters) - American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten crouched to sit at a first-graders’ table in a Florida school, chatting with masked 6-year-olds about books and their former kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Smith. Lillian Smith, a local union steward who taught at William A. Chapman Elementary in Miami-Dade County for more than 30 years, died last month of COVID-19. At least four Miami-Dade County teachers or staff have died from COVID so far this school year, as cases and hospitalizations in Florida have soared. Weingarten, in Miami on Friday as part of a U.S. tour to support COVID-safe back-to-school measures like masking, told Reuters that Florida is ""a place where you have a governor who is more concerned about his political aspirations than the safety and the wellbeing of the people he was elected to serve."" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis in July issued an executive order barring school mask mandates. DeSantis, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said parents should decide if their children wear masks. Parents in Florida and across the country have clashed with school and health officials in what has become a politicized tussle over COVID precautions. Miami-Dade is among several districts that imposed mask requirements in defiance of DeSantis' order. This week, the state Department of Education withheld funding from two of those districts, though a state judge ruled last week that the state does not have the authority to ban mandates. read more Two small districts that did not require masks have had to shut down because of soaring COVID cases. With staff members sick or quarantined, bus driver and teacher shortages have led to overcrowding on buses and larger class sizes, making social distancing harder, Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar said. ""Districts are just trying to do the best they can, but it’s challenging when we’re not getting the support from the state,” Spar said. Valda McKinney, a local teachers' union organizer at Chapman, said the loss of her friend Lillian Smith -- who according to Weingarten and local news reports had not been vaccinated -- made COVID-19 feel more threatening. ""Teachers are anxious,"" McKinney said. In the first-grade classroom on Friday, national union leader Weingarten handed out new books. “This is our honoring Mrs. Smith,” Weingarten said. “One of the things she wanted more than anything else was for all of you to succeed.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Japan PM Suga to back vaccine minister Kono to succeed him,2516,"TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japan's outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will back the popular minister in charge of the nation's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, to succeed him, Nippon News Network reported on Saturday. Political manoeuvring was heating up among potential candidates and ruling party grandees on Saturday, a day after Suga's surprise announcement that he was stepping down, ending a one-year term as prime minister that has seen his support crumble as COVID-19 surged. Hours after Suga's announcement, broadcaster TBS reported, without citing sources, that Kono intended to run for head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Kono told reporters only that he wanted to consult party colleagues before deciding. Suga is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election scheduled for Sept. 29. The LDP leader will become prime minister given the party's majority in parliament. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular among young voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics, which is dominated by older men less adept with social media. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring, while several others have voiced interest. With no clear front-runner, the stance of Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe will be closely watched, given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, analysts say. Abe, who stepped down citing ill health last September after a record eight-year term, had publicly backed Suga's reelection. With Suga out, Abe now supports former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, who is close to the former premier, TBS said. Takaichi, who would be Japan's first female prime minister, had been seen as struggling to gain the backing of the 20 LDP lawmakers needed to run in the party race. Abe's support could boost her chances. Kishida said on Saturday he would leave the national sales tax at 10% if elected, reiterating that he would fund a new economic package worth tens of trillions of yen (hundreds of billions of dollars) by issuing more government bonds. ""I'm not thinking of touching the sales tax for the time being,"" Kishida told a Nippon News Network programme. ""We then must consider Japan's finances from the standpoint of how to make use of the fruit of economic growth."" Before Abe, Japan had six prime ministers in as many years.

"Australia reports record daily COVID-19 cases, braces for worse",2195,"MELBOURNE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australia, struggling to quell its worst wave of COVID-19, reported 1,756 infections on Saturday, another record high, and officials warned that worse is yet to come, urging people to get vaccinated. Most of the cases were again in New South Wales, which has been fighting an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant since mid-June. The state reported 1,533 new cases and four further deaths. Neighbouring Victoria reported 190 cases, the Australian Capital Territory 32 and Queensland one. Recent daily infections are running about double the levels of Australia's previous worst wave of the pandemic a year ago. Believing this outbreak cannot be eliminated - a successful strategy used by states and territories in earlier waves - New South Wales and Victoria authorities have focussed on speeding inoculations to make the cases less virulent. Although infections in Victoria, in its sixth lockdown, dropped slightly from Friday's 208, health authorities said the outbreak has not peaked. ""The overall trend is a slow and steady increase. That's why vaccination is so critical, as is following the rules,"" Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told a press conference. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, expects more than 1,000 new cases a day for at least two more weeks, with hospital admissions likely to peak in October. On Saturday, health officials said 137 of the 173 people in intensive care in hospitals were not vaccinated. Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, together home to nearly 60% of Australia's 25 million people, have been under strict lockdown for weeks. That is expected to continue until 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. At the current pace, Australia may reach that threshold in late October or early November. Only about a third of those aged 16 and over have been vaccinated, although the pace has picked up considerably, with the federal government racing to secure more Pfizer shots. Australia has recorded just under 60,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,036 deaths, far fewer than many comparable countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Fertility app maker Flo Health faces consolidated privacy lawsuit,3793,"(Reuters) - Flo Health Inc is facing a consolidated class action complaint accusing the period and fertility-tracking app developer of sharing users' sensitive health information with third parties without app users' knowledge. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in California federal court, also named the alleged third parties - Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, and data analytics companies Flurry Inc and AppsFlyer Inc - as defendants. Flo Health, through its counsel from Dechert, declined on Friday to comment on the pending litigation. Lawyers for Facebook, Google, Flurry and AppsFlyer, of the law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, Hunton Andrews Kurth and Latham & Watkins, respectively, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The newly filed action brings together plaintiffs from seven proposed class actions filed against Flo Health earlier this year. The first complaint stemming from the alleged unlawful data disclosure came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Flo Health in January. Users of the women's health app hand over personal information to Flo Health, including ""intimate details"" about sexual health and menstrual cycles, among other things, to use the app, the complaint said. Flo Health allegedly violated users' privacy by disclosing that information to third parties through software development kits (SDKs) incorporated into its app, despite the company's privacy policies and ""public assurances"" that it would not share data, the complaint said. In using the third parties' SDKs, Flo Health transmitted the personal information back to other defendants, which allegedly ""knew that the data collected and received from Flo Health included intimate health data"" but didn't stop that because the data is ""vital to their business,"" such as for marketing and data analytics purposes, according to the complaint. The lawsuit asserts several claims against Flo Health, including invasion of privacy, breach of contract, and violation of the federal Stored Communications Act. The plaintiffs accuse the other companies of ""aiding and abetting"" Flo Health's alleged practices, among other claims, including a Federal Wiretap Act claim against Facebook, Google and Flurry. Plaintiffs' counsel filed a separate motion Thursday seeking the appointment of lawyers from three firms as interim co-lead counsel. The filing touts the data privacy, consumer protection and complex class action experience of the proposed leaders, and highlights the proposed structure as reflecting a ""diverse slate of attorneys."" Carol Villegas of Labaton Sucharow, Diana Zinser of Spector Roseman & Kodroff and Christian Levis of Lowey Dannenberg are seeking the leadership roles. The proposed leaders ""embody the diversity necessary to vindicate claims for women whose private intimate health data was disclosed without authorization,"" the lawyers wrote. Villegas, Zinser and Levis didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is Frasco v. Flo Health Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:21-cv-00757-JD.

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2810,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE), a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout. ""It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know,"" Fauci said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers. FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court's rightward lurch put Roe v. Wade on the brink,4992,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump made a statement that seemed brash at the time: If he were elected and got the chance to nominate justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion would be overturned. By this time next year, with the court having tilted further to the right thanks to Trump's three appointments to the nation's highest court, his prediction could come true. The court's decision on Wednesday night to allow Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect in apparent contravention of the 1973 Roe decision suggests the court is closer than ever to overturning a ruling U.S. conservatives have long reviled. ""We don't know how quickly or openly the court will reverse Roe, but this decision suggests that it's only a matter of time,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion history at Florida State University College of Law. Two generations of American women have grown up with access to abortion, although its use has declined over the past decade. But while Roe handed liberals a victory on a crucial issue of the times, it also helped to power the religious right into a galvanizing force as it worked to get the decision overturned. Since Congress never acted to formalize abortion rights - which shows what a hot button issue it is politically - the same court that once legalized abortion has the power to allow states to ban it. In the coming months, the court will weigh whether to throw Roe out altogether as the justices consider whether to uphold a 15-week abortion ban in the state of Mississippi. Unlike the Texas dispute, in which the justices did not directly address whether Roe should be reversed, they will in the Mississippi case. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022, just months before an election that will determine whether the Democrats retain their narrow majority in both houses of Congress. The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe, in 1992, opponents were bitterly disappointed when the court's moderates banded together and upheld abortion rights. Although the Supreme Court had a conservative majority, it was not deemed conservative enough. Storm clouds roll in over the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Tom Brenner MCCONNELL'S ROLE The reason why the outcome could be different now is in part thanks to the decades-long efforts of conservative legal activists to re-shape the court, which bore fruit during Trump's presidency. Trump was aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as the death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which gave him a third vacancy to fill just before he lost the November 2020 election. All three Trump nominees were pre-vetted by conservative lawyers associated with the Federalist Society legal group. All three -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were in the majority as the court allowed the Texas abortion law to go into effect. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority, which means that even if one peels away - as Chief Justice John Roberts did on Wednesday and in another abortion case in 2020 - the conservative bloc still retains the upper hand. Conservative Republican McConnell played a key role in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees to the bench. Democrats' hopes were raised early in 2016, when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died, that what had been a 5-4 conservative majority on the high court could switch to a 5-4 liberal majority for the first time in decades. McConnell crushed those dreams, refusing to move forward with then-Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, when Trump came into office in early 2017 he was able to immediately nominate Gorsuch, who was duly confirmed by McConnell's Republican-led Senate. Trump and McConnell then pushed through the nomination of Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 despite allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee, which he denied. Kennedy was a conservative but had voted to uphold abortion rights in key cases, including in 1992. Finally, in September 2020, Ginsburg died. In an unprecedented move, Trump and McConnell installed Barrett just days before Election Day on Nov. 7, leading to widespread accusations of hypocrisy but cementing the conservative majority. Despite the favorable winds, some anti-abortion advocates are playing down the importance of the Supreme Court's Texas ruling, and say the fate of Roe v Wade is still up in the air. ""I've long thought the court should overturn Roe because it is not based on what the Constitution actually says,"" said John Bursch, a lawyer at conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, before adding: ""This order doesn’t give a signal either way about what the majority will do in the Mississippi case.""

A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout. ""It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know,"" Fauci said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers.

Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court's rightward lurch put Roe v. Wade on the brink,4992,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump made a statement that seemed brash at the time: If he were elected and got the chance to nominate justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion would be overturned. By this time next year, with the court having tilted further to the right thanks to Trump's three appointments to the nation's highest court, his prediction could come true. The court's decision on Wednesday night to allow Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect in apparent contravention of the 1973 Roe decision suggests the court is closer than ever to overturning a ruling U.S. conservatives have long reviled. ""We don't know how quickly or openly the court will reverse Roe, but this decision suggests that it's only a matter of time,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion history at Florida State University College of Law. Two generations of American women have grown up with access to abortion, although its use has declined over the past decade. But while Roe handed liberals a victory on a crucial issue of the times, it also helped to power the religious right into a galvanizing force as it worked to get the decision overturned. Since Congress never acted to formalize abortion rights - which shows what a hot button issue it is politically - the same court that once legalized abortion has the power to allow states to ban it. In the coming months, the court will weigh whether to throw Roe out altogether as the justices consider whether to uphold a 15-week abortion ban in the state of Mississippi. Unlike the Texas dispute, in which the justices did not directly address whether Roe should be reversed, they will in the Mississippi case. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022, just months before an election that will determine whether the Democrats retain their narrow majority in both houses of Congress. The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe, in 1992, opponents were bitterly disappointed when the court's moderates banded together and upheld abortion rights. Although the Supreme Court had a conservative majority, it was not deemed conservative enough. Storm clouds roll in over the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Tom Brenner MCCONNELL'S ROLE The reason why the outcome could be different now is in part thanks to the decades-long efforts of conservative legal activists to re-shape the court, which bore fruit during Trump's presidency. Trump was aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as the death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which gave him a third vacancy to fill just before he lost the November 2020 election. All three Trump nominees were pre-vetted by conservative lawyers associated with the Federalist Society legal group. All three -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were in the majority as the court allowed the Texas abortion law to go into effect. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority, which means that even if one peels away - as Chief Justice John Roberts did on Wednesday and in another abortion case in 2020 - the conservative bloc still retains the upper hand. Conservative Republican McConnell played a key role in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees to the bench. Democrats' hopes were raised early in 2016, when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died, that what had been a 5-4 conservative majority on the high court could switch to a 5-4 liberal majority for the first time in decades. McConnell crushed those dreams, refusing to move forward with then-Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, when Trump came into office in early 2017 he was able to immediately nominate Gorsuch, who was duly confirmed by McConnell's Republican-led Senate. Trump and McConnell then pushed through the nomination of Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 despite allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee, which he denied. Kennedy was a conservative but had voted to uphold abortion rights in key cases, including in 1992. Finally, in September 2020, Ginsburg died. In an unprecedented move, Trump and McConnell installed Barrett just days before Election Day on Nov. 7, leading to widespread accusations of hypocrisy but cementing the conservative majority. Despite the favorable winds, some anti-abortion advocates are playing down the importance of the Supreme Court's Texas ruling, and say the fate of Roe v Wade is still up in the air. ""I've long thought the court should overturn Roe because it is not based on what the Constitution actually says,"" said John Bursch, a lawyer at conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, before adding: ""This order doesn’t give a signal either way about what the majority will do in the Mississippi case.""

Latham requires vaccinations following FDA approval,3399,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Latham & Watkins, one of the highest-grossing and largest law firms in the U.S., will require all of its employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-October. Latham may be the first major U.S. law firm to implement a vaccination mandate following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's full approval of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine last month. About half of the 200 highest-grossing U.S. law firms are now requiring vaccinations, and in many firms, the percentage of employees who are vaccinated is between 90% to 95%, according to Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann. The first law firm to announce a vaccination mandate was Davis Wright Tremaine in January. Since then many more firms have issued mandates, particularly as U.S. coronavirus cases began spiking again due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Other law firms, including Baker McKenzie, Dechert, Dentons and Morrison & Foerster announced their vaccination mandates last week. But representatives at those firms confirmed those mandates were announced internally prior to the FDA approval. Latham's executive committee, in a memo sent to all U.S. employees on Wednesday, said more than 95% of its U.S. personnel and ""virtually 100%"" of its U.S. partners have been vaccinated. The memo was first published on the legal blog Above The Law on Friday; a representative for Latham confirmed the memo's authenticity and declined to comment further. The memo specifically cites FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine as one of the reasons why the firm is mandating vaccinations. Industry consultants said they expect the FDA approval will push more law firms and companies into adopting vaccination mandates. FDA approval gives law firms more legal coverage to mandate vaccinations, said Marcie Borgal Shunk, president of law firm consultancy The Tilt Institute. She said some people questioned whether a COVID-19 vaccine could be mandated when the FDA hasn't given full approval. ""With this step, law firms will gain confidence in their legal footing,"" Borgal Shunk added. Employers in many other industries are requiring their workforce to be vaccinated as well. One national survey of nearly 1,000 employers said more than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment. Google's parent Alphabet Inc, Walmart Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine.

"Porsche, Puma to join Germany's DAX as index expands",2285,"FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - German carmaker Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) and sportswear maker Puma (PUMG.DE) will join the nation's premier DAX stock index, as it expands to 40 from 30 companies in the biggest overhaul of its 33-year history, the exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) said on Friday. The expansion, contemplated for years, got a push in reaction to the collapse of German payments company Wirecard, which dramatically fell from grace in 2020, just two years after promotion to the benchmark index. A bigger index means greater diversification and potentially more stability for investors. The move promotes an array of companies to an index previously reserved for German corporate titans like Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Siemens (SIEM.NS). Other new entrants include the plane manufacturer Airbus (AIR.PA) and the online fashion retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE). The changes are effective on Monday, Sept. 20. Wirecard's demise embarrassed the German government and stained the nation's reputation as a safe haven investment, accelerating the reform imitative backed by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer. Deutsche Boerse announced the overhaul plans last November, saying the changes would improve quality of the DAX indexes and align them with international standards. . Over the past year, Deutsche Boerse has also imposed more stringent membership criteria in financial reporting and profitability. Manfred Schlumberger, portfolio manager at Starcapital, said he doubted the expansion would make the index more attractive. U.S. indexes are more attractive than their European counterparts because they have a high portion of future-oriented industries like technology and communication, he said. ""The DAX doesn't get that through the overhaul because those industries simply don't exist here,"" he said The remaining new entrants include: health technology company Siemens Healthineers (SHLG.DE), flavour and fragrance maker Symrise (SY1G.DE), lab equipment maker Sartorius (SATG.DE), chemicals distributor Brenntag (BNRGn.DE), meal-kit company Hellofresh (HFGG.DE), and genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE).

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2630,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. It is not clear whether the Food and Drug Administration will have enough time to review Moderna's submission before the meeting.

Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month.

Brazil's Bolsonaro signs law that could break COVID-19 vaccine patents,811,"BRASILIA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday signed off on a law allowing for vaccine and medication patents to be broken in a public emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. But the right-wing leader vetoed the provisions that patent holders would need to transfer the knowledge and supply the raw materials needed to duplicate the vaccines and medications. According to a statement from his office, those provisions were seen as being too difficult to implement and discouraging investment in researching new technologies. Bolsonaro had previously criticized the law as potentially harming Brazil's commercial relationships. Under the law, the president is the one who would determine when to break a patent in an emergency. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"As COVID surges, more Florida school districts revolt against governor's mask rules",5235,"TAVARES, Fla., Sept 3 (Reuters) - In a scene replayed across the United States, angry parents and activists streamed into a meeting of the Florida's Lake County school board on Thursday where it considered whether to mandate mask-wearing for students and staff due to COVID. Some opponents of the mask proposal brandished signs that read “Let Our Children Breathe.” Even with Florida seeing a record number of coronavirus cases, one attendee called the pandemic ""overblown."" Another was escorted out by deputies after yelling at board members. The proposal would require staff and students to wear masks for 14 days at schools with COVID positivity rates at or above 5%. But Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, effectively banned similar mandates in July. Since DeSantis' order, more than a dozen Florida counties have rebelled and voted to require masks to protect students and teachers as the Delta variant sweeps across the state. This week, the state's Department of Education sanctioned two counties that passed school mask requirements. The battle between DeSantis and the state's school systems echoes larger fights across the country. Other Republican-run states such as Arizona and Texas have also banned mask mandates in schools even as COVID cases have soared in their states, as parents and voters are sharply divided over safety measures and personal freedoms. The pushback in Florida against the Republican governor initially was led by large urban school districts run by Democrats. But this week saw more conservative counties that backed Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election also defying DeSantis and instituting their own mandates. Earlier this week, populous Brevard County along Florida’s east coast, which went for Trump over President Joe Biden by more than 16 percentage points in November, narrowly voted to approve a 30-day school mask mandate. A day later, Hernando County, which supported Trump over Biden by almost 30 points, also passed a mandate, but one that allows parents to opt out. In Lake County near Orlando, which also strongly backed Trump, a school official said on Thursday that more than 1,000 students of the 36,000 in the district had tested positive for the virus. The board listened to more than three hours of public comment on the mask proposal then postponed a decision. Some 280 people spoke or sent emails on the issue, and two-thirds of them supported the idea, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Still, proponents of a mask mandate were booed and heckled by the crowd in attendance. “This topic has completely polarized communities,” said Andrea Messina, president of the Florida School Boards Association. Residents demonstrate before the Lake County School Board started an emergency meeting to discuss mask mandates to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tavares, Florida, U.S., September 2, 2021. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo 'ABSOLUTE CRISIS' While the conflict centers on whether state or local governments are best equipped to make decisions on health and safety, it also has become a political challenge for DeSantis, whose state has once again become a COVID-19 hotbed. After being widely praised last year when cases declined and the state’s economy seemed revived, DeSantis has faced renewed criticism for his opposition to masks and employer vaccine mandates. Florida on Aug. 26 saw a single-day record number of new cases of the virus – almost 28,000 – since the pandemic began. A spokesperson for DeSantis, Christina Pushaw, defended the ban on school mandates, saying the governor is ""protecting the rights of families and children from all levels of government overreach."" At the Brevard County meeting on Monday, Misty Belford, the chair of the school board who a month earlier had opposed a mask mandate, switched her vote and gave proponents a 3-2 majority. Belford changed her mind, she told Reuters, after watching the district’s caseload spike, including a 49% increase in student cases from one week to the next. One school was closed for two days after most of its students were quarantined. “We are at an absolute crisis point,"" Belford said. But board member Katye Campbell, who voted against the mandate, said she worries about negative effects on students from requiring masks, such as asthma flare-ups, suicidal ideation and panic attacks. “There is nothing easy about this decision because our community is so divided,” Campbell said. Belford said she was relying on a decision from a Florida court last week that declared the DeSantis rule illegal. DeSantis on Thursday appealed the ruling. Earlier this week, the Florida Board of Education said it would penalize two counties that voted for mask mandates without providing a parental opt-out, Alachua and Broward, by withholding funds from the districts for the board members’ salaries. Leanetta McNealy, chair of the Alachua County school board, said her board voted for the mask mandate last month based on scientific evidence that it would help mitigate the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. “I’d rather have a decrease in my compensation than have a death under my watch,” she said.

Psilocybin lawyer asks 9th Circ to weigh workaround to fed drug law,3389,"(Reuters) - A Seattle, Washington, clinic on Thursday urged the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to order the federal Drug Enforcement Authority to offer a way for terminally ill patients to try psilocybin, the active chemical in hallucinogenic mushrooms, to treat their anxiety and depression. Much of the argument, before Circuit Judges Mark Bennett, Sandra Ikuta and Ryan Nelson, focused on whether the DEA's conclusion that it could not waive any part of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which bans psilocybin except for limited research purposes, could even be appealed. The clinic, the Advanced Integrative Medical Science (AIMS) Institute, asked the agency for permission to use psilocybin under Washington and federal ""right to try"" laws, which allow terminally ill patients to try drugs that are still under investigation. Forty-one states have passed such laws. Psilocybin has been the subject of clinical trials to treat terminal patients' anxiety and depression, but remains a so-called Schedule I substance under the CSA, meaning doctors cannot prescribe it. According to AIMS' petition for review, the DEA responded that there was no way for it to grant a waiver for the use of a Schedule I drug under right-to-try laws. At the outset of Thursday's argument, Nelson pressed AIMS' attorney, Matt Zorn of Yetter Coleman, to explain what exactly the clinic was appealing. ""How can a response to a request for instructions ever be a final order?"" he asked. ""It's because of the specific response in this case, and that response was, there is no process,"" Zorn said. ""Because the agency said there is nothing for you to use, we have nowhere to go."" The state of Washington, represented by Deputy Solicitor General Peter Gonick, weighed in to support the clinic. Gonick said the case raised the ""federalism concern that, where possible, statutes should be construed to avoid federal interference with areas traditionally left to states, such as regulation of the medical profession here."" He said that Congress and state legislatures had passed right-to-try laws because they recognized that the federal drug approval process was ""just too long"" for some terminally ill patients. Thomas Pulham of the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing for the DEA, said the agency's determination that the CSA did not allow it to grant waivers under right-to-try laws was not subject to review. ""It was an informal response to a request for assistance from a member of a regulated community that did nothing more than provide the agency's view on existing law,"" he said. When Nelson asked how the clinic could get the issue before a court, Pulham responded that if it administered psilocybin, and the DEA brought an enforcement action, it could challenge that action as unlawful. The answer did not fully satisfy the judge. ""Usually we don't require a party to go and subject themselves to liability in order to appeal,"" he said. The court did not clearly indicate how or when it would rule. The case is AIMS v. USDEA, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-70544.

Impel NeuroPharma enters migraine market with FDA nod for nasal spray,1875,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Impel NeuroPharma Inc's (IMPL.O) nasal spray to treat migraine got approval from the U.S. health regulator on Friday, marking the company's entry into a crowded market of medicines for a disease that affects about 39 million Americans. The drug, Trudhesa, can be self-administered to the bloodstream by being sprayed in the upper part of the nasal canal and is formulated using dihydroergotamine (DHE), an agent that works on the serotonin receptors linked to migraine. Impel will price the treatment between $600 and $850 for a pack containing four doses and is aiming for more than $500 million in peak sales, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Adams told Reuters. The Seattle-based company, which went public in April, plans to commercially launch Trudhesa in early October. Its rivals include Biohaven Pharmaceutical's (BHVN.N) Nurtec ODT and AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) Ubrelvy, both of which are orally administered. The market also has another intranasal DHE product, Migranal, whose commercial success has been held back by its less effective method of administration in the lower nasal cavity. Cowen & Co analysts said the Trudhesa's differentiated nasal delivery method should help it find a solid role in the treatment paradigm. Around 1 billion people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. ""We are taking this product to a population that wants DHE ... to be available in a consistent, predictable and trustworthy way,"" Impel's Adams said.

Canada sees urgent need to get more young people vaccinated,1660,"OTTAWA/CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New modeling shows an ""urgent need"" to get more young adults in Canada vaccinated as the country fights a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant, the public health agency said on Friday. At the current rate of vaccination, new COVID-19 cases could surge past the peak of Canada's third wave and could exceed hospital capacity within months, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said. The modeling showed a need to speed up the overall rate of vaccinations, particularly for the 18-39 age group, to reduce the impact of the Delta resurgence, PHAC said in a presentation. ""The bottom line is that millions of people across Canada remain unvaccinated and at high risk of COVID-19 infections and severe illness outcomes,"" said Canada's chief public health officer Theresa Tam. The western province of Alberta said it will hand out C$100 ($79.96) gift cards as an incentive to encourage unvaccinated Albertans to get jabs. It is the first province in Canada to offer cash to boost vaccination uptake. Alberta has the lowest vaccination rate in Canada and leading the country in new COVID-19 cases, recording 1,339 new cases on Thursday. ""This is a crisis of the unvaccinated,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told a news conference on Friday. ""You are putting yourselves and our healthcare system at risk.""

"Early Canada election call backfires on Trudeau, who now trails in polls",3283,"MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself behind in polls ahead of a snap election he called hoping his management of the COVID-19 crisis would propel him to victory. Trudeau called the Sept. 20 election last month, two years ahead of schedule. At the time, his Liberals were well ahead and looked likely to regain the majority in parliament they lost in 2019. His main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, has repeatedly attacked him for calling a vote during the pandemic. The latest polls by Nanos, Ekos and others show Liberal fortunes have faded as voters have grown fatigued with Trudeau, 49, who has been in power since 2015. One Liberal strategist said on Friday the early-vote call had backfired as it was seen as ""wrong"" and ""greedy"" by electors. Also on Friday, Canadian health officials released modeling showing new COVID-19 cases could surpass the peak of the third wave within the month, and warned that if vaccinations among young adults do not ramp up, the country's hospital capacity may be exceeded. read more The Nanos Research survey for CTV put the Conservatives on 35.7% public support, with the Liberals on 30.7% and the smaller left-leaning New Democrats on 18.3%. An Ekos poll published late Thursday puts the Conservatives at 35.5% versus 30.7% for the Liberals.(See more polls: ) If these numbers hold up on election day, O'Toole would most likely win a minority administration. (See profiles of party leaders: read more ) On Thursday, the Conservative leader came out of a French-language leaders' debate without suffering much damage. During the exchanges, Trudeau said that if there were to be another minority government, there would most likely be another election in 18 months. read more ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interests,"" O'Toole told reporters on Friday. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that,"" he said after a campaign announcement in Montreal. On Friday, Trudeau said his debate comments referred to the average duration of minority governments. He then attacked O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates for domestic travel, saying the Conservative policy would put people in danger. ""Without strong leadership on vaccines, our kids won't be safe in the classroom, our businesses won't grow and thrive, and all Canadians will be at risk,"" Trudeau said. On Friday, Canadian health officials said there is an ""urgent need"" to ramp up vaccinations for 18- to 39-year-olds, who lag the rest of the population. They also said masking and social distancing must continue into the winter to prevent further spread. Some 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. Liberal strategists expressed hope their fortunes will improve if Canadians start paying more attention next week after Monday's Labor Day holiday and two more debates. During the last two election campaigns, Trudeau won crucial support late by telling Canadians a vote for the New Democrats - who compete for the same left-leaning segment of the electorate - would split progressives resulting in a Conservative government.

Payrolls and the stock market: Wall Street usually shrugs off jobs report,2559,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Markets always look to the Labor Department's monthly employment report with great anticipation. But whether the data disappoints or surprises to the upside often has only a modest effect on overall stock index moves. Friday's report missed consensus by a mile, for example, showing the economy added a paltry 235,000 jobs instead of the 728,000 expected by economists. But Wall Street seemed to largely shrug off the disappointment. The S&P 500 was essentially flat. ""Today it’s as simple as ‘bad news is good news’ because the weak number gives the Fed cover to maintain its dovish outlook and likely push back tapering,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. Detrick also pointed to strengthening yields as a reason the stock market is not terribly worried. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose about 4 basis points to 1.3257% Friday afternoon on data in the jobs report showing wages heating up even more than feared. Even so benchmark Treasury yields are well below the highs earlier this year when traders were most worried about the U.S. recovery kindling durable inflation.

Biden warns of 'unconstitutional chaos' due to Texas abortion ban,6134,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause ""unconstitutional chaos"" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday. The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because of an unusual feature that leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, who could collect cash bounties of at least $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against women who seek abortion after their sixth week of pregnancy or those who help them. Civil rights advocates warned that concept could cause havoc if it is adopted by other states or applied to other contentious rights, such as gun ownership. ""It unleashes unconstitutional chaos and empowers self-anointed enforcers to have devastating impacts,"" Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement directing federal agencies to act to protect the right to abortion enshrined in the high court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women."" By a 5-4 vote, the justices late on Wednesday denied an emergency request by abortion and women's health providers for an injunction on enforcement of the ban while litigation continues. The ban took effect early on Wednesday and prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. The law could still be blocked at some other stage. The law would amount to a near-total ban on the procedure in Texas - the second-most-populous U.S. state - as 85% to 90% of abortions are obtained after six weeks of pregnancy, and would probably force many clinics to close, abortion rights groups said. 'STUNNING' One of the court's six conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, joined its three liberals in dissent. ""The court's order is stunning,"" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. ""Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand."" In an unsigned explanation, the court's majority said the Texas law's unusual construction - leaving enforcement to individuals bringing lawsuits - limited its ability to act and that its decision was not a reflection of the ultimate constitutionality of the law. ""Federal courts enjoy the power to enjoin individuals tasked with enforcing laws, not the laws themselves,"" the court said. ""This order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts."" Pro-life supporter Josh Alcorn demonstrates in front of the Supreme Court after the Court upheld the first nationwide ban on a specific abortion procedure, in Washington, April 18, 2007. REUTERS/Jim Young (UNITED STATES) A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In a June survey, some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The Republican president of Florida's state Senate, Wilton Simpson, told local station WFLY-TV on Thursday that he planned to follow Texas' lead and bring up a similar abortion ban in the chamber's next session. ""This law will begin saving the lives of tens of thousands of Texas babies and we look forward to the day that babies’ lives will be spared across America,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee. Biden, a Roman Catholic who has shifted to the left on abortion in recent years, said the White House would look at what steps the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can take to respond to the Texas law. The Office of the White House Counsel and Biden's Gender Policy Council will also review the matter. POLARIZING ISSUE Abortion remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and most Republicans opposing them. The number of abortions reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped in recent decades, to roughly 620,000 in 2018, the most recent figures, down from 790,000 in 2009. Congress has the power to legalize abortion nationwide, and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the Texas law and vowed to take up a bill to do so when Congress returns later this month. ""Its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade, and even refuses to make exceptions for cases of rape and incest,"" Pelosi said. ""This ban necessitates codifying Roe v. Wade."" Democrats hold narrow majorities in Congress, but passage in the House would not guarantee success in the Senate, which requires 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. Democrats hold 50 seats in that chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote. The court decision illustrates the impact of Republican former President Donald Trump's three conservative appointees to the nation's highest court, who have tilted it further to the right. All were in the majority. A ban like Texas' has never been permitted in any state since the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states to ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, often at six weeks. Courts had previously blocked such bans, citing Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the coming months in a case centering on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, in which the state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK panel does not recommend COVID vaccines for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds,2799,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain's vaccine advisers said they were not recommending the vaccination of all 12- to 15-year-olds against COVID-19, preferring a precautionary approach in healthy children due to a rare side effect of heart inflammation. The advice could see Britain pursue a different approach to the United States, Israel and some European countries, which have rolled out vaccinations to children more broadly. However a final decision has not been taken, as the British government said it would consult medical advisers to look at other factors, such as disruption to schools. Many politicians and some scientists have spoken out in favour of vaccinating more children amid concern that COVID-19 could spread in schools that are re-opening after summer holidays, further disrupting education. Britain has reported more than 133,000 deaths from COVID-19 and nearly 7 million cases, and while transmission among children can be high, they are rarely severely ill from the disease. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday said children with underlying conditions that made them more at risk from COVID-19 should get vaccinated. For healthy children, there was still a small benefit from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and advisers said the risk-benefit was ""finely balanced"". However, the JCVI said it wanted more information on the long-term effects of rare reports of heart inflammation, known as myocarditis, in young people following vaccination with Pfizer's shot. Myocarditis is rare and normally mild, with patients usually recovering in a few days. read more ""Of course these vaccines do work and would be beneficial to children in terms of preventing infection and disease, but the number of serious cases that we see of COVID in children this age are really very small,"" JCVI member Adam Finn told Reuters. ""There are uncertainties about the long-term implications of (myocarditis), and that makes the risk-benefit balance for these children really quite tight and much tighter than we would be comfortable to make the recommendation."" UK health minister Sajid Javid, who sets policy for England, and his counterparts from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, wrote to the chief medical officers (CMOs) of the four nations, asking for further advice, ""including on educational impacts"". ""Given the importance of this issue, we would be grateful if you could provide your advice as soon as possible,"" the four health ministers said in a letter to the CMOs. The JCVI is also expected to advise on a potential booster vaccine programme for the elderly and vulnerable which could start this month. read more JCVI member Finn said there would be an update on boosters ""within the next few days.""

India restores mobile services in Kashmir two days after death of separatist leader,2057,"SRINAGAR, India, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mobile services in Indian Kashmir were restored late on Friday, two days after they were suspended following the death of a veteran secessionist leader in the disputed Himalayan region, a police official told Reuters. However, curbs on mobile internet and restrictions on the movement of people in the Kashmir valley would continue, police chief Vijay Kumar said. India tightened curbs on movement of people in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar and elsewhere, with scores of armed soldiers fanning out ahead of prayers on Friday, a day after Syed Ali Shah Geelani was laid to rest. Geelani, 91, died on Wednesday and was buried near his home in the city, where soldiers patrolled the streets to forestall any large-scale protests and gatherings at mosques. ""More troops have been deployed in sensitive areas and more roads have been barricaded,"" a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Despite the curfew there was violence in at least a dozen of places in Kashmir in which one paramilitary trooper was injured, the official said, adding that police had to use tear gas to disperse crowds. For years, Geelani, one of Kashmir's most senior political leaders, had led a hardline faction of separatist groups that sought to secede from India following an armed revolt against New Delhi. Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and arch rival Pakistan, which claim the region in full but rule only parts. Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was renewed in August 2019, when New Delhi scrapped the autonomy of its state of Jammu and Kashmir, splitting it into two federally administered territories. Shops were shut across parts of Srinagar, with many streets deserted and coils of barbed wire strung across them. Soldiers with assault rifles manned checkpoints. Health worker Shakeel Ahmad said he had to navigate more barricades on Friday to get to his hospital than a day ago. ""I was stopped at around a dozen places,"" he said.

Top U.S. health officials say not enough data to recommend boosters widely -New York Times,1021,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Top U.S. health officials have told the White House they may not have enough data to recommend COVID-19 booster shots for the wider general public by late September as President Joe Biden had anticipated, the New York Times reported on Friday. The top government officials advised the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the discussion. They said they needed more time to collect and review all the necessary data, according to the report. Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Times said.

"Japan's struggling PM Suga steps down, sets stage for new leader",5691,"TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in a surprise move on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for a new premier after a one-year tenure marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and sinking public support. Suga, who took over after Shinzo Abe resigned last September citing ill health, has seen his approval ratings drop below 30% as the nation struggles with its worst wave of COVID-19 infections ahead of a general election this year. Suga did not capitalise on his last major achievement - hosting the Olympics, which were postponed months before he took office as coronavirus cases surged. His decision not to seek reelection as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president this month means the party will choose a new leader, who will become prime minister. There is no clear frontrunner, but the popular minister in charge of Japan's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, intends to run, broadcaster TBS said on Friday without citing sources. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring. Before Abe's record eight-year tenure, Japan had gone through six prime ministers in as many years, including Abe's own troubled first one-year term. Tokyo stocks jumped on news of Suga's decision, with the benchmark Nikkei (.N225) rising 2% and the broader Topix (.TOPX) hitting its highest levels since 1991. ""I want to focus on coronavirus response, so I told the LDP executive meeting that I've decided not to run in the party leadership race,"" Suga told reporters. ""I judged that I cannot juggle both and I should concentrate on either of them."" He said he would hold a news conference as early as next week. Suga's abrupt resignation ended a rollercoaster week in which he pulled out all the stops to save his job, including suggestions he would sack his long-term party ally, as well as plans to dissolve parliament and reshuffle party executive and his cabinet. He is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election slated for Sept. 29. The winner, assured of being premier due to the LDP's majority in the lower house of parliament, must call the general election by Nov. 28. Suga has been an important ally for U.S. President Joe Biden in pushing back against China's increasingly assertive behavior and he was the first foreign leader Biden welcomed in person at the White House in April. read more A State Department spokesperson said Biden was grateful for Suga’s leadership and partnership on shared challenges, including COVID-19, climate change, North Korea, China, and preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ""The U.S.-Japan alliance is and will remain ironclad, not just between our governments, but our people,"" the spokesperson said. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to media after he annouced to pull out of a party leadership race at his official residence in Tokyo, Japan, September 3, 2021. Kyodo/via REUTERS Suga's departure will raise questions about the timing of an in-person summit of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia seen as a means to counter China that Washington has been looking to host this fall. read more RACE FOR LEADER Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said Kishida was the front runner for the moment, ""but that doesn't mean his victory is assured."" Nakano said Kono, Suga's administrative reform minister, could run if he gets the backing of his faction leader in the party, Finance Minister Taro Aso. Declaring himself a contender, Kishida, a soft-spoken Hiroshima lawmaker, on Thursday criticised Suga's coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic. Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba said he was ready to run if the conditions and environment are right. He was a rare LDP critic of Abe during his time as prime minister. Kono has led Japan's rocky inoculation drive, but remains high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga. Kono has stopped short of declaring his candidacy, telling reporters he wanted to carefully consult with party colleagues first. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular with younger voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics dominated by older men who are less social media-savvy. Abe's stance will be closely watched given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, experts say. The LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its lower house majority, but forecasts suggest the LDP could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever leads the party next. ""Stock prices are rising based on a view that the chance of LDP's defeat in the general election has diminished because anyone other than Suga will be able to regain popularity,"" said Toru Suehiro, a senior economist at Daiwa Securities. Suga's image as a shrewd political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74% when he took office. He initially won applause for populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments. But removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism. His delay in halting a domestic travel programme - which experts say may have helped spread coronavirus around Japan - hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses.

"Tyson Foods, unions strike deal over COVID-19 vaccine mandate",2573,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said on Friday that labor unions have agreed to support its requirement for U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by November, and the company will offer new benefits to workers including paid sick leave. Companies have been working to incentivize employees to get vaccinated through bonuses and other benefits as the highly contagious Delta variant drives an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. In some instances, employees who do not get shots face penalties like higher insurance costs. read more Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said on Aug. 3 that U.S. employees must get vaccinated, though the requirement for unionized plant workers was subject to negotiations. read more The company has now won support from the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represent more than 80% of Tyson's 31,000 unionized workers in the United States, it said in a statement. Tyson runs slaughterhouses in rural areas where some residents have been reluctant to get vaccinated. In Iowa, where Tyson operates pork plants, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to state data. Nationwide, 53% of the total population and 62% of people eligible for vaccines have been fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The UFCW, America's largest meatpacking union, said it secured 20 hours of paid sick leave per year for Tyson employees as part of negotiations over the mandate. It is the first national U.S. agreement to provide paid sick leave to meatpacking workers, the union said. All Tyson employees can begin earning the 20 hours starting on Jan. 1, the company said. The UFCW initially expressed concerns over the mandate because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not fully approved vaccines, instead granting approval for emergency use. Last week, the FDA granted full approval to Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE's shot. read more Tyson said more than 90,000 employees, or 75% of its U.S. workforce of 120,000, have received at least one dose of a vaccine, up from about 56,000 before the mandate. Some workers can be exempt from the mandate for religious or medical reasons, according to the UFCW."
"'They told us they hate Africans': Hundreds detained, deported from Abu Dhabi",5877,"BEIRUT, Sept 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kabirat Olokunde, a Nigerian migrant worker, planned to spend her birthday with friends in the city of Abu Dhabi. Instead, she turned 28 in a frigid prison cell, one of about 700 Africans imprisoned by Emirati authorities. In unparalleled mass arrests, the workers were jailed with ""no legal justification"" on the night of June 24-25, and later started being deported, said ImpACT International for Human Rights Policies and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor. ""I celebrated my birthday in chains, with no mattress,"" Olokunde said by phone from the Nigerian city of Lagos, where she was deported on Aug. 3 without access to her belongings. ""I still have the trauma in me,"" added the single mother, who is now jobless after working as a bus attendant and caretaker in Abu Dhabi, a regional trade and tourism hub that is part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In an Interior Ministry statement on Friday, the UAE said it had detained 376 men and women for offences related to human trafficking, ""extortion, assault, and acts contrary to public morality"". It said most of them were deported, but another 50 remained in prison due to a lack of travel documents. The Abu Dhabi government communications office and the Nigerian embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to requests for comment on the rights groups' report. Human rights groups have previously documented the imprisonment of hundreds of activists, academics and lawyers in the UAE, often following unfair trials on vague charges. The UAE has dismissed those accusations as false and unsubstantiated. RACIALLY MOTIVATED The UAE is home to nearly 10 million people, more than 80% of whom are expatriates who send remittances home to their families, according to the United Nations. Workers from developing countries often live in shared residencies in Abu Dhabi with separate wings for different nationalities, like La Gym, where Olokunde was arrested. African and Asian workers have highlighted stigmatisation and racism in the past, but the two rights groups said the June raid was a marked escalation. ""The scale of this racially motivated deportation is completely unprecedented,"" said Michela Pugliese, a migration researcher at Euro-Med Monitor. ""The victims and other migrants who aspire to work safely in the UAE have had this right unjustly revoked. Its consequences will be felt for years to come."" The investigation, based on interviews with more than 100 migrant workers, found that Abu Dhabi's Rapid Intervention Forces (SWAT), Criminal Investigation Department and police carried out mass arrests in at least four apartment buildings. The subsequent forced deportations were illegal, Pugliese said, as many of the workers had valid residency permits and work visas and were denied due process or access to their personal property. Friday's interior ministry statement said the deportations were conducted ""in accordance with legal procedures"" and with the knowledge of the workers' home countries. STUN GUNS Migrant workers told researchers that the arresting units used excessive force against them, including stun guns, and touched women's bodies inappropriately. Olokunde said she was arrested in shorts and a bra, and was not allowed to dress before being transported to the jail. When she and other women went on a hunger strike to demand justification for their arrest, they were chained for seven days, including her birthday, Olokunde said. Two workers who spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation said they slept on the floor in large, group cells, but were not given masks to protect against COVID-19 infection. In jail, the report said, detainees were denied access to health care and sanitary pads while women had their periods. The rights groups said detainees were not granted access to lawyers or told why they had been arrested - but some were indirectly accused of prostitution, which is a crime in the UAE. During her single, brief interrogation, Olokunde said she was asked, ""How much do you charge for a massage?"" SECRET CAMPAIGN According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), migrants are entitled to challenge their arrest in their country of residence. ""The abuses outlined demonstrate that migrants have had their rights to due process violated, and their detention conditions could amount to ill-treatment,"" said Rothna Begum, HRW's women's rights researcher in the Middle East. ""It is horrific that the UAE authorities appear to be conducting a secret campaign of mass arrests of African migrants, without any clear legal basis for such arrests or detention,"" she added. Kenneth Rubangakene, a 31-year-old Ugandan clerk who had lived in Abu Dhabi since 2017, also said he was taken from his La Gym apartment to prison. He said guards scanned his fingerprints and retinas without explanation, chained his hands and feet for three days, and imitated the sound of a couple having sex, asking if he had ever heard that noise at La Gym. ""They told us Africans are spoiling their country, they want to get rid of Africans from the street, we Africans are stupid,"" he said. He was deported from Dubai International Airport on July 29, according to a printed booking confirmation that Rubangakene shared with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which he said was given to him by prison guards. ""It was so shameful at the airport. You are arriving in a prison uniform, in prison sandals,"" he said. The Ugandan embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rubangakene said he has about 6,000 dirham ($1,634) stuck in a bank account in the UAE that he cannot access, as his bankcard - along with teaching certifications he would need to apply for new jobs - all remained in his room.

"Ho Chi Minh City could lift lockdown, end 'zero COVID-19' policy",2501,"HANOI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre Ho Chi Minh City, which has kept residents confined at home under lockdown, is considering reopening economic activity from Sept. 15, shifting from a ""zero COVID-19"" strategy to a policy of living with the virus. The city of 9 million people is targeting a phased reopening and the full vaccination of its citizens by the end of this year, according to the draft seen by Reuters, which has yet to be endorsed.

Ho Chi Minh City alone has recorded 241,110 coronavirus infections and 9,974 deaths, representing half of the country's cases and 80% of its fatalities. The vast majority of those have come in recent months, ending hopes that Vietnam could continue to achieve success it showed in 2020, when aggressive contact tracing and quaratining led to one of the world's best COVID-19 containment records. The ministry of health on Friday reported 14,922 coronavirus infections, a record daily increase, raising its caseload to 501,649 with 12,476 deaths.

The percentage of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 health concerns also remained largely unchanged during a period when coronavirus cases caused by the Delta variant shot up across the United States.

PNC owes $107 mln for Allegiant’s ‘egregious’ breach of trust – 8th Circ,3753,"(Reuters) - A predecessor’s failure to safeguard trust assets against a massive fraud scheme involving pre-need funeral contracts will cost PNC Bank $107 million, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Monday. PNC, represented by Dowd Bennett, argued that the $100 million judgment should be reduced to $46 million and that all of the $7 million fee award should be erased because its predecessor, Allegiant Bank, also was an unwitting victim of the scam perpetrated between 1998 and 2004 by National Prearranged Services Inc (NPS) and two related insurance companies. Although Allegiant had not participated in the scheme, its failure to detect it was “an egregious breach of trust” that justified the 2019 award of compensatory and punitive damages to the receiver for NPS and several state life insurance guaranty associations, Circuit Judge Steven Colloton wrote for the panel. He was joined by Circuit Judges Roger Wollman and Bobby Shepherd. Daniel Reilly of Fennemore argued the appeal for the receiver, the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, and the state guaranty associations of Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Arkansas. He was unable to comment on the opinion late Monday. PNC’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pittsburgh-based bank acquired liability for Allegiant’s former trust services as part of its 2008 acquisition of National City Bank. A year earlier, Texas insurance regulators had appointed a receiver to liquidate NPS and two Texas-based insurers, Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance and Memorial Service Life Insurance Company. Like NPS, both insurers were owned by James “Doug” Cassity or his family. NPS had ostensibly complied with Missouri law by purchasing life insurance policies to cover its obligations to the pre-need contract holders and placing them in seven trusts at Allegiant Bank. However, NPS would frequently “mismatch” policies, creating a Ponzi-like scheme in which new contracts were used to pay for services under older ones. The insurers also allowed NPS to borrow against the value of the policies, depleting their value. The policy loans required a sign-off by Allegiant, but the companies never requested Allegiant’s approval, and Allegiant never caught the omission. The receiver and the guaranty associations filed suit in U.S. District Court in St. Louis in 2009, while federal prosecutors brought criminal fraud charges against Cassity and other individuals in 2010. The prosecution ended with several guilty pleas and one conviction in 2013. The civil suit went to a jury trial in 2015. The 8th Circuit tossed the $391 million verdict in 2017, saying the case should have been tried to a judge. On remand, Senior U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber awarded $72 million in compensatory damages, $15 million in punitive damages and $12 million in prejudgment interest, plus attorneys’ fees. PNC argued that the award should have been limited to compensatory damages only, and that Webber had miscalculated the amount. Among other things, it said, Allegiant was not responsible for $13 million in policy-loan losses, and any losses in some trust accounts should have been reduced by $11 million in gains in other accounts. “We conclude that none of PNC’s arguments establishes reversible error, and therefore affirm the judgment,” the 8th Circuit held.

Sutter Health settles Medicare overcharge claims for $90 million,3876,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - California-based hospital operator Sutter Health has agreed to pay $90 million to settle claims that it overcharged the federal government by misrepresenting the health of patients enrolled in privately administered Medicare Advantage plans. The settlement, announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice, resolves a 2015 whistleblower lawsuit brought under the federal False Claims Act by Kathy Ormsby, a former employee of Sutter affiliate Palo Alto Medical Foundation, in San Francisco federal court. According to Ormsby's attorneys, it is the largest settlement of an FCA case against a hospital system over alleged Medicare Advantage fraud, and the second-largest Medicare Advantage fraud settlement ever reported overall. ""This case is an important example of whistleblowers and their lawyers partnering with the government to bring extra expertise and legal firepower to the fight against fraud,"" Mark Kleiman of Kleiman Rajaram, one of the lawyers, said in a statement. ""Today's result sends a clear message that we will hold healthcare providers responsible if they knowingly provide or fail to correct information that is untruthful,"" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. Sutter, which is represented by Katherine Lauer and Amy Hargreaves of Latham & Watkins, said the deal brings ""closure to a long-running dispute, allowing Sutter to avoid the uncertainty and further expense of protracted litigation."" Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is a program under which patients enroll in privately run managed-care plans to receive benefits. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays those plans a fixed amount per patient adjusted for the patients' individual risk factors, which is determined based on diagnosis codes submitted by providers. For example, diagnoses of diabetes or congestive heart failure would result in higher payments. Ormsby and the government alleged that, beginning around 2010, Sutter knowingly submitted unsupported diagnosis codes for some patients, leading to inflated payments, and did not take sufficient corrective action after becoming aware of the unsupported codes. In addition to the payment, the settlement includes a five-year corporate integrity agreement under which Sutter must institute a centralized risk assessment program and hire an outside organization to review a sample of its patient diagnostic data each year. Ormsby is expected to get 15% to 30% of the settlement under the FCA, though the exact share has not yet been determined. The deal comes a month after the federal government joined a similar Medicare Advantage overbilling lawsuit against hospital giant Kaiser Permanente. The case is United States ex rel.

U.S. economy's hot vax summer ends in cool COVID fall as Delta rises,6634,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The promise of a ""normal"" U.S. economy this summer, which kicked off with the June revival of restaurants, air travel and baseball games, is transforming into an uncertain fall of rising health and economic risks. Labor Day weekend, the traditional end of the U.S. summer season, was pegged as the moment when the economy would finally transition out of the pandemic slump, with private sector jobs and wages replacing unemployment benefits. Instead, the summer is closing with rising COVID-19 case counts, hospitals bulging with patients, a sharp slowdown in jobs and dark predictions. Most startling - the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that between now and Dec. 1 there will be 100,000 COVID deaths, more than in the same period last year, when a wave of winter infections took hold and vaccines were not yet available. ""I don't think fall 2021 is going to give us the catharsis we were waiting for,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for hiring site Indeed, or provide a clear view of how fast U.S. job markets can recover the 5.3 million jobs missing from before the pandemic. ""The transition is going to be longer than expected. The issue is, is it a stumble or does the baton get dropped?"" Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 jobs last month after surging 1.053 million in July, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists had expected 728,000 new jobs. read more Special $300-per-week unemployment benefits end on Saturday. While employers hope that will usher new job applicants into a labor-starved market, there are signs the pandemic may have begun to curb their hiring plans instead. read more The reopening of schools, far from smoothing the way for parents to return to full-time jobs, has been marked by erratic outbreaks, quarantines and closures, as school boards battle over masking students. The manager at The Irish Whisper, a pub near the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Maryland, said that business has fallen off since an initial summertime rush. ""It's not as great as pre-COVID, but it's better than not having anything,"" said the manager, who only gave his first name Andrew. ""I thought we were in the clear and then this variant emerged."" After a strong start early this summer, attendance is dropping in baseball stadiums. BIDEN'S VIRUS OVERSHADOWED It is a particularly sensitive moment for U.S. President Joe Biden. The Democratic president has taken a hit in the polls from the resurgent virus, faces criticism over the Afghanistan withdrawal and must deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida and a gauntlet of deadlines in Congress in coming weeks to keep the government funded and his economic agenda on track. ""There's a lot more work to do,"" to fix the U.S economy, Biden said Friday, addressing the weak jobs numbers. """"We need to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant,"" he said, repeating that it was a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Biden's strategy of wiping out COVID by getting all of the United States vaccinated was hindered by a politically charged anti-vaccination movement this summer, and the pace of vaccinations has slowed since peaking in April. A run of higher-than-expected inflation due to supply chain woes and labor shortages consumed what would otherwise have been healthy wage gains. A closely watched index of consumer confidence, which can influence spending, tumbled in August to a six-month low. Progress on the virus ""is (Biden's) No. 1 advantage, but people are discouraged and frustrated and it's also interacting with the economy,"" said one Biden adviser not authorized to speak on the record. Administration officials believe the recovery largely remains on track, and infrastructure and spending plans may partly make up for the lapsed weekly unemployment insurance payments. Democrats are hoping to finalize a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill as soon as this month while also working on a $3.5 trillion bill that could only secure party-line support. ""This bill is going to end years of gridlock,"" Biden said of the smaller infrastructure bill. ""Both literally and figuratively it's going to change things,"" he said. Republicans are fighting the administration's most ambitious spending plans. Goldman Sachs economists now estimate the ""fiscal cliff,"" as spending rotates away from the record government transfers of the past 18 months, will be a noticeable drag on growth by late 2022. Oxford Economics economists expect to trim their outlook for 2021 gross domestic product growth to 5.5%, down from 7% in early August. The reduction reflects ""the deteriorating health situation weighing on optimism and spending, lingering capital and labor supply constraints and a slower inventory rebuild,"" Oxford chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco said in an email. DELTA WEIGHS ON HIRING The August jobs data released Friday showed the current surge of infections, which drove the number of new cases from around 11,000 a day in mid-June to almost 150,000 daily this week, slowed hiring and the broader recovery. ""Today’s report has the Delta variant written all over it,"" Indeed's Bunker said. ""It is clear that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases is a strong headwind to the labor market."" Economists are not expecting the sort of collapse in demand for restaurants, travel and other services seen in earlier virus waves. Many Federal Reserve officials feel businesses and families have learned to navigate the situation, either finding ways to lower the risk of infection as they resume work and business, or worrying less about infection because they're vaccinated. The disappointing 235,000 in new jobs comes as the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July. It has, however, been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Some employers argue that job growth figures could be much higher, given the record number of openings, if they had not had to compete with unemployment benefits. That hasn't been borne out in states that ended the federal benefits early over the summer, where there's little evidence more people went back to work. Instead, employers seem to be pulling back on hiring themselves. Hiring at around 50,000 small businesses has fallen since midsummer, data from time manager Homebase shows, while a workforce recovery index from time management firm UKG, which analyzes time card punches, fell 2.4% from July to August. It was sharpest in the southeast, where the spread of the virus was most intense. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Tunisia's powerful union calls to change political system,1632,"TUNIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tunisia's powerful labour union on Friday called on the president to propose changes to the political system and put them to a referendum after his seizure of governing powers in July in a move critics called a coup. The UGTT union, which has so far backed President Kais Saied since he sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and said he was taking over executive authority, has for weeks urged him to name a government and announce a roadmap for the crisis. On Friday, its leader Noureddine Taboubi, also indicated it would back changes to the constitution and political system, blaming them for the gridlock that preceded Saied's intervention on July 25. ""The main problem in Tunisia is the political and constitutional system that has crippled everything and left no way for progress,"" he told reporters, adding that any changes must be put to a referendum. The president's actions appear to have widespread support after years of economic stagnation and political paralysis. However, Saied's delay in appointing a new government or announcing his longer-term plans has caused jitters among some Tunisians fearing a lack of direction in the face of major economic challenges or even a return to autocracy. The president has rejected that, saying his actions were lawful and that rights will be upheld, and dismissing concerns over the lack of clarity about his next steps. ""We demand the speedy formation of the government to resolve urgent files such as unemployment, education, health, and the economic and social situation,"" Taboubi said.

"U.S. accuses UPMC, leading surgeon of billing fraud",3738,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The federal government has accused the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the head of its cardiothoracic surgery department of fraudulently billing Medicare and Medicaid for complex surgeries. The complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, claims that UPMC has regularly allowed James Luketich to book as many as three complex surgeries at the same time, going back and forth between patients and not participating in key parts of the surgeries, while keeping patients under unnecessary anesthesia. The government alleges Luketich and UPMC violated laws and regulations that they say prevent physicians like Luketich, who perform teaching duties within a medical school or residency program, from billing federal health insurance programs for such surgeries. It also alleges that the practice harmed patients. ""The laws prohibiting 'concurrent surgeries' are in place for a reason: to protect patients and ensure they receive appropriate and focused medical care,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Kaufman of the Western District of Pennsylvania said in a statement. ""Our office will take decisive action against any medical providers who violate those laws, and risk harm to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries."" ""Dr. Luketich is confident that (the allegations) are wholly incorrect, and we will vigorously defend against them,"" Luketich's lawyer, Efrem Grail of The Grail Law Firm, said in an email. ""Dr. Luketich enjoys a stellar reputation as a surgeon, as a person of integrity and as a doctor who cares."" UPMC spokesperson Paul Wood said that the case was based in a ""misapplication or misinterpretation"" of federal guidance, and that performing and billing for overlapping surgeries is not fraudulent. The case began with a 2019 whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former UPMC doctor, Jonathan D'Cunha. The government exercised its power to intervene in the case under the False Claims Act. The government alleged that, in addition to resulting in hundreds of fraudulent bills to government health insurance programs, Luketich's practices have resulted in serious harm to patients by extending their surgeries and time under anesthesia, increasing the risk of complications. In January 2015, Jonas Johnson, the head of UPMC's Surgical Services Oversight Committee reprimanded Luketich following an incident in which he left a patient under anesthesia and could not be found for an hour, according to the complaint. Later that year, Johnson again warned Luketich that he could only provide services to one Medicare patient at a time, the complaint said. Nonetheless, according to the complaint, Luketich continued to schedule and perform concurrent surgeries. Luketich is one of UPMC's highest sources of revenue, the government said, bringing in tens of millions of dollars per year. It is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

Giant Eagle loses bid to escape Ohio opioid claims,4240,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Supermarket and pharmacy chain Giant Eagle has lost a bid to escape claims by two Ohio counties that it fueled opioid addiction by ignoring red flags that prescriptions were being used for illegal sales. The order Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, means Giant Eagle will face trial next month alongside Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc. Rite Aid Corp, which had also been a defendant in the case, recently settled. The trial will serve as a bellwether to test public nuisance claims against pharmacies in the sprawling multidistrict litigation over opioids. ""Giant Eagle is committed to responsible pharmacy operations and dedicated to serving our communities ... in each of the five states in which we operate,"" Dan Donovan, a spokesperson for Giant Eagle, which is represented by Robert Barnes of Marcus & Shapira. ""We look forward to detailing our record of compliance with state and federal laws and regulations at trial."" Frank Gallucci of Plevin & Gallucci, a lawyer for plaintiffs Lake and Trumbull Counties, declined to comment. The retailer had argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Ohio Board of Pharmacy had repeatedly inspected its facilities and found it in compliance with applicable laws, including the Controlled Substances Act. That law requires pharmacies to have procedures in place to prevent the diversion of prescription drugs, including opioids, into illegal channels, including a system for reporting suspicious orders. Polster, however, said the counties had presented ""extensive evidence"" of possible violations of anti-diversion laws that inspectors did not find, but that Giant Eagle knew about. That evidence included expert testimony that pharmacists repeatedly filled ""obvious 'red flag'"" prescriptions and documented instances of diversion in the two counties linked to Giant Eagles' prescriptions, he said. The judge also noted that the counties alleged that the inspections were ""limited in scope"" and could not necessarily uncover all violations. While Giant Eagle did not have to show perfect compliance with the law to avoid a public nuisance claim, the judge said, the extent to which it complied was ""best left to a jury."" More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by local governments around the country accusing drugmakers of falsely marketing opioids as safe and pharmacies and distributors of shirking their duty to monitor and report suspicious prescriptions and orders. The nation's three largest distributors and Johnson & Johnson have offered to pay up to $26 billion to settle cases against them, though it is not yet clear which states will opt into that deal. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP has won approval for a bankruptcy plan that will resolve claims against it. Major pharmacy chains, however, have yet to propose a nationwide settlement. The opioid crisis has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the last two decades. The cases are County of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45032, and County of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45079, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

Life insurers shift to pre-pandemic norms after COVID vaccine roll-outs,5108,"LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations is making life insurers more enthusiastic about offering cover to those with underlying health conditions - some without even knowing whether customers have been vaccinated. Life insurers were imposing waiting periods to buy cover in the early stages of the pandemic for certain age groups, as well as for those who had been infected, saying the long-term health consequences of coronavirus were not fully understood. read more But now that vaccines are prevalent in major economies such as Britain and the United States, life insurers see fewer risks. Helen Croft, head of underwriting strategy at AIG Life (AIG.N), said the insurer had previously been more cautious in offering cover as a result of the pandemic, but the efficacy and widespread use of the vaccine meant it could provide insurance for more customers. ""The vaccine take-up has been excellent,"" she said. AIG Life did not check if individual customers have been vaccinated, with Croft pointing out the insurer did not ask customers about other inoculations, such as for flu. ""I don't think it's necessary to be asking about the vaccine - the population level take-up gives us enough comfort,"" she said. Insurers such as LV=, Aviva (AV.L) and Zurich (ZURN.S) also said they did not ask vaccination questions, with Zurich highlighting the possible limitations of inoculation, such as long-term effectiveness or the impact of new variants. Regardless of vaccination status, customers with underlying health conditions may pay up to five times the standard rate for life insurance products, sources said. A reduction in the hospitalisation and death rate as a result of vaccination has meant that ""almost all"" insurers in Britain have reversed previous COVID-19 restrictions on life cover, said Phil Jeynes, director of corporate sales at insurance broker Reassured. Britain was one of the first countries to roll out a vaccination programme and almost 80% of all over-16s are fully vaccinated, according to UK government figures. Premiums have stayed much the same during the pandemic, Jeynes added. Rather than raising rates, insurers postponed providing cover for those above a certain age, with some underlying health conditions or who were recovering from COVID-19, industry sources said. Life insurance premium volumes dropped by 11% in Britain and by 0.1% in the United States in 2020, according to Swiss Re. Sharp falls in household incomes due to lockdowns and job losses hit demand for life insurance last year, the reinsurer said in a recent report. Swiss Re expects strong life insurance growth this year and next due to the economic recovery and increased consumer awareness of risk. In the United States, where more than half of the population is vaccinated, major life insurers Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Lincoln (LNC.N) told Reuters they did not ask about vaccines. The Insurance Compact, standards adopted by 47 U.S. states, said it did not currently allow insurers to ask vaccination questions as state insurance regulation has not yet set public policy around the vaccine and underwriting. ASKING QUESTIONS However, some insurers in Britain are asking customers whether they have been inoculated, particularly if their health condition makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19, and this could affect the cost or size of their cover. ""For those that have been fully vaccinated, our risk appetite will be higher,"" said Rose St Louis, protection director at Scottish Widows. ""We may be able to offer improved terms to those who have had both vaccines."" Legal & General (LGEN.L) typically imposes a 12-month waiting period on customers who are clinically vulnerable and where the impact of COVID-19 may be life-threatening. ""To avoid postponing applications for this 1% of new customers, we will now ask whether or not they have had their required vaccine doses...allowing us to give cover to customers when it would otherwise not be available,"" an L&G spokesperson said by email. Unvaccinated vulnerable customers would be declined cover for now, though allowances would be made for those who could not have the shot for medical reasons such as pregnancy, L&G said. Insurers need to get clearance from their reinsurers for any underwriting changes they make, as reinsurers may otherwise be unwilling to provide that cover. L&G said its reinsurers agreed with its approach, without naming them. One global reinsurer, who declined to be identified, said it was supporting the stance of ""several insurers"" in Britain who were insuring customers in higher risk medical groups for larger amounts of cover, if the customers provided evidence that they were fully vaccinated. Clive Allison, director, life and pensions at consultants EY, said the need for vaccine questions may be short-lived. ""There'll be a convergence where most adults will have been double-vaccinated,"" he said. ""The ones that haven't are most likely to be in the younger age bracket, and typically are not looking to take out insurance cover."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Britain distributing COVID-19 vaccines to climate talks delegates,1382,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain has started shipping COVID-19 vaccines to delegates attending global climate talks it is hosting next month who cannot access them at home, with the first shots to be delivered next week.

"Air quality improved slightly in 2020 during lockdowns, U.N. agency says",1984,"GENEVA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Key air pollutants temporarily plunged by unprecedented levels during coronavirus lockdowns last year, with fine particle pollution falling by more than a third across parts of Asia, a U.N. agency said on Friday. Particulate matter (PM 2.5) fell by up to 40% across Africa, South America and Southern Asia and by smaller amounts in parts of Europe and North America, the World Meteorological Organization said in its inaugural Air Quality and Climate Bulletin. It said COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions led to a ""dramatic short-lived fall in emissions"" of key air pollutants, especially in urban areas. ""During episodes when there were lockdown measures the air quality in many parts of the world has substantially improved and the improvement was largely on the side of particles,"" said Oksana Tarasova, head of the organization's atmospheric environment research division. The WMO bulletin, which compared 2020 air quality with 2015-2019 readings, showed that levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide emitted from the burning of fuel fell nearly everywhere and by as much as 70%. Air pollution is the single greatest environmental risk factor for premature deaths globally. It is likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40% of Indians by more than nine years, a report showed this week. read more The decline in pollutants last year was too short-lived to have an impact on health, Tarasova said. She cited events such as wildfires in Australia, smoke from biomass burning in Siberia and the United States, and the ""Godzilla effect"" of sand and dust drifting from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic to North America as adversely impacting air quality. The WMO bulletin also showed that ozone concentrations which can damage and inflame airways actually increased in some places last year. Tarasova said this was linked to lower nitrogen oxide levels which usually destroy the harmful gases. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

He added that it was almost certain that the country would face a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections around the end of the year. The WHO this week designated the C.1.2 variant as one for further monitoring, a category that reflects that it may pose a future risk but that the evidence is currently unclear. It has not been designated as a ""variant of interest"" or ""variant of concern,"" categories considered more serious and notated by letters of the Greek alphabet. South African researchers are currently running laboratory tests on how C.1.2 responds to antibodies generated by vaccines or prior infection, but it could be weeks before those results are out. Genomic sequencing data from South Africa this week showed that C.1.2 accounted for 2.4% of genomes sequenced in August, versus 2.5% in July and 1.2% in June. The Delta variant accounted for roughly 95% of sequences in August. Delta is the fastest spreading variant the world has encountered so far, and it is upending assumptions about COVID-19 even as nations loosen restrictions and reopen their economies. read more South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, one of only four currently labelled a variant of concern by the WHO. Beta is believed to spread more easily than the original version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and there is evidence vaccines work less well against it, leading some countries to restrict travel to and from South Africa.

Review: Covid-19 and the crises yet to come,5297,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - What are the lessons of the coronavirus pandemic? It may seem far too early to be asking that question. After all, Covid-19 is far from over. Around 100,000 Americans are in hospital with the virus. Countries like Australia are still effectively cut off from the rest of the world. And large swathes of the globe have barely begun vaccinating their populations. Even so, the historian Adam Tooze makes a strong case for looking back, and beginning to draw some conclusions. In “Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World’s Economy”, the Columbia University professor recaps the timeline of 2020, surely one of the most seismic years in global history. His focus is the period that started with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s public acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak on Jan. 20, 2020, and ended with U.S. President Joe Biden’s inauguration exactly a year later. The scale and variety of what unfolded in the intervening days remains dizzying. Tooze lucidly organises these events in the book’s 300 pages, while maintaining the sweeping perspective that will be familiar to readers of “Crashed”, his magisterial history of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. The story throws up multiple paradoxes. Covid-19 was a massive failure of public policy which also prompted governments to prop up their economies with unprecedented speed and decisiveness. It was a public health catastrophe that spurred breakthroughs in life-saving vaccines. In the United States the pandemic exacerbated already deep political divisions, culminating in the contested presidential election, yet also produced the world’s largest fiscal stimulus. Confronting the crisis forced governments to discard old orthodoxies, many of which were already under attack. Politicians who had previously sought to rein in public spending deployed vast sums to support citizens stuck at home and businesses which had been forced to close. Central banks hoovered up government bonds and backstopped a range of financial markets. Commitments to free trade and private enterprise were discarded in the rush to secure face masks and vaccines, and support crisis-struck industries. These extraordinary actions were largely designed to preserve the status quo. “None of the politicians who voted for huge spending had started the year planning to change society,” Tooze writes. And in some cases the sums were far too small. Compare the developed world’s meagre contributions to vaccines for poorer countries with the much larger economic gains that would have flowed from ending the pandemic around the world. Nevertheless, it’s hard to see the political pendulum returning to overly disciplined public spending, or a hands-off approach to private enterprise. This opens up intriguing possibilities, like a large-scale and state-directed investment drive to reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels. Despite years of warnings and several near misses, the world failed to adequately prepare for a global pandemic. Perhaps it can now avoid making the same mistake when it comes to climate change? Yet Covid-19 has also exposed many shortcomings. The virus “delivered a staggering demonstration of the collective inability of the global elite to grasp what it would actually mean to govern the deeply globalized and interconnected world they have created,” Tooze writes. If anything, the deterioration of relations between China and the United States over the past year and a half makes joined-up decision-making even less likely in future. Tooze does identify some pockets of strength. The rapid development, testing and deployment of vaccines is a testament to what scientists and governments can do when confronted with an urgent crisis. Central banks, too, successfully cushioned the impact of a massive global supply shock. These technocratic interventions have the unfortunate side effect of adding to inequality inside and between countries. The challenge for politicians is to counter those effects. The history of the past decade is not encouraging in this regard. Yet the world is bound to face bigger and longer global emergencies. The unprecedented floods in Europe, China and the United States this summer are surely just a taster for a time when weather fluctuations become wilder and harder to predict. It’s less likely climate change will knock a tenth off global GDP in short order, as the pandemic did in the second quarter of last year. But future crises are on the way. The history of Covid-19 so far suggests we still have many lessons to learn.

AstraZeneca reaches settlement with EU on COVID-19 vaccine delivery,4246,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and the European Commission have reached a settlement on the delivery of 200 million pending COVID-19 vaccine doses by the drugmaker, ending a row about shortages that had weighed on the company and the region's vaccination campaign. The dispute plunged the European Union into crisis earlier this year as states, under pressure to speed up vaccinations, scrambled for shots. It also caused a public relations crisis for AstraZeneca, which is led by Frenchman Pascal Soriot. Having reduced its initial reliance on the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, Brussels said parts of the volumes committed under the deal would be transferred outside the EU to ease global vaccine inequality. The bloc's vaccine supplies now come mainly from Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE). As part of Friday's settlement, AstraZeneca has committed to deliver 60 million doses of its vaccine, Vaxzevria, by the end of the third quarter this year, 75 million by the end of the fourth quarter and 65 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. When including deliveries already made, that schedule maps out the honouring of a 300 million dose bulk purchasing contract struck about a year ago between the company and the EU, after months of conflict over delays. The European Commission launched legal action against AstraZeneca in April for not respecting that contract and for not having a ""reliable"" plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU's executive body said that under the new agreement, member states would be provided with regular delivery schedules and if there were any delayed doses, capped rebates would be applied. EU members with low inoculation rates would be prioritised, it added. VACCINATION RATES Vial labelled ""AstraZeneca coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine"" placed on displayed EU flag is seen in this illustration picture taken March 24, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration ""There are significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial,"" said EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. She also said some deliveries under the settlement would go to lower-income countries outside the EU. ""We will continue helping the rest of the world. Our aim is to share at least 200 million doses of vaccines through COVAX with low and middle-income countries until the end of this year,"" she said, referring to vaccine-sharing facility run by the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization. The European Commission has caught up with its campaign schedule, saying this week that 70% of the European Union's adult population had been fully vaccinated, hitting a target set at the beginning of the year. read more The settlement allows for distribution while the highly-contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is causing a spike in cases and vaccines are being studied for longevity of protection. The EU's vaccine needs have for the most part been served by Pfizer and BioNTech because the partners have managed to ramp up production for ample supplies. Concerns over very rare cases of serious blood clotting linked to the Astra shot, co-developed with Oxford University, have weighed on demand for it. Use of the Astra shot in the region fell further when Germany decided in July that recipients of an initial Astra shot would complete their two-shot regimen with a dose of Pfizer or Moderna. ""I'm very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding which allows us to move forward and work in collaboration with the European Commission to help overcome the pandemic,"" said AstraZeneca senior executive Ruud Dobber. About 92 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine have been distributed to EU member states so far, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. That is far below the 437 million doses delivered by Pfizer/BioNTech but ahead of the 77 million Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine doses delivered. Astra said it had released more than 140 million doses to date at no profit to the EU, including doses that have yet to be delivered to member states and EU consignments to COVAX or to other non-EU states.

Supply shortages sap strength of euro zone recovery,2822,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity remained strong last month, despite fears about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and widespread supply chain issues, according to a survey which suggested the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end. IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 59.0 last month from July's 15-year high of 60.2, still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction but below a 59.5 ""flash"" estimate. ""Growth momentum in the euro zone is fading according to recent surveys and nowcast indicators. The big question is whether the recovery can carry on at a decent pace and quickly close the gap with pre-pandemic GDP,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. The economy will grow 2.2% this quarter, a Reuters poll published earlier on Friday predicted and IHS Markit said the euro zone economy was on track to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, if not sooner. But ongoing supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant the cost of raw materials soared again this month. The input prices index was a near record 69.5 - although down from July's 69.9. Inflation surged to a ten-year high of 3.0% in August with further rises likely, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase. read more Still, with much of the service industry reopening after the lifting of many restrictions its PMI remained well above breakeven at 59.0, albeit below July's 59.8 which was the highest reading since June 2006. Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at a strong pace as businesses which had been hit by coronavirus lockdowns catered for pent-up demand, although staff shortages and costs pressures put a dent in France's growth. read more Italy's services industry recorded another month of steep growth, sustaining hopes of a strong economic rebound, and in Spain the sector expanded for the fifth month in a row as more COVID-19 travel restrictions were phased out. In Britain, outside the common currency union, the recovery lost more momentum than originally estimated as staff shortages and supply chain issues weighed on companies in the country's huge services sector. Meanwhile, euro zone retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, were much weaker than expected in July, pulled down mainly by a sharp fall in the number of goods bought online, official date showed. read more Fears lockdown measures could be re-imposed have also put a dent in optimism.

"China faces difficulties in expanding COVID-19 vaccination drive, official says",1731,"BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China is facing growing difficulties in expanding its mass COVID-19 vaccination drive, but it will continue to inoculate more people and step up the programme of booster shots, a health official said on Friday. Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission, did not specify the obstacles but stressed that those who have not been vaccinated could not rely on being protected by those who have had the shots amid concerns over the highly transmissible Delta variant. ""Recently, as (pushing vaccination work) came to the later stage, it has become increasingly difficult,"" Zheng said at a health forum. He said China has given full doses to about 900 million people, or more than 60% of its 1.4 billion population, but cited some experts saying China may need a vaccination rate higher than 80%. China administered around 13 million doses per day on average in July and August, slower than June's daily average of 19 million. By the end of October, the country is expected to complete giving regular regimen doses to 1.1 billion people as well as giving booster shots to limited groups such as the elderly and high-risk employees, according to estimates in Zheng's presentation. Currently people are recommended to take booster doses of the same type of technology as their first vaccinations, but more options might be available once studies on using different shots as boosters yield results, Zheng said. China has supplied 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the rest of the world, Zheng said. President Xi Jinping said in August that China would strive to provide 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries in 2021. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Are COVID boosters needed? FDA vaccine advisers wrestle with a thorny issue,4100,"CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to discuss two key questions when they meet on Sept. 17 to consider a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign this fall: Is protection from the initial shots waning, and will boosters help? The debate will likely be heated following the Biden Administration's announcement last month - before the experts could weigh in - that the U.S. plans to start booster doses Sept. 20 if regulators approve them. The White House move usurped the normal process in which the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make these sort of science-based decisions, according to interviews with six current and former FDA scientists and CDC advisory panel members. On Wednesday, the FDA set the meeting date to consider a third booster shot of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE vaccine and may discuss others. Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) submitted data to the FDA for consideration of its booster and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) last week said it was in discussions with the agency about one. read more ""The recommendation shouldn't precede the data, which is what happened here. And that's why people are so upset,"" said a source close to the FDA advisory panel who was not authorized to speak on the record. These experts took the FDA's decision to hold an advisory panel meeting on boosters as a promising sign that their opinions will be heeded, but said a favorable outcome is not guaranteed. Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University in Washington and a former chief scientist at the FDA, said the agency will need to go through all the relevant data before Sept. 17 to be ready for the panel meeting. ""We need to see that there is a meaningful boost in antibody levels and there are no red flags,"" he said. That will be challenging given that scientists still do not agree on the level of antibodies in the blood that predict vaccine protection, said Norman Baylor, chief executive of Biologics Consulting and former director of FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review. Much of the drug company argument in favor of boosters hinges on data that show antibodies wane over time and that another shot increases them. ""One of the things that committee members have to struggle with is ... what does this mean?"" Baylor said. ""You see an increase, but is that increase sufficient? And for how long?"" 'SHOW THE DATA' A fierce debate is expected around whether most Americans should get another shot rather than just those at high risk of severe illness, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose. ""You've got to show the data - show me that you're solving an important public health problem,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, a former FDA vaccine advisory panel member and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. The issue, according to Poland and others, is that the current crop of vaccines were designed to prevent hospitalization and death, which the CDC says they continue to do. The Biden Administration has taken a cue from Israel, where early data shows that a booster campaign appears to be lowering transmission of the virulent Delta variant, which has begun to cause mostly asymptomatic and mild infections in fully vaccinated people. Boosters would increase antibody levels, which fight infections. But immune memory from other components of the immune system is what offers protection from severe disease and hospitalization, and that can last for years. ""No matter how many booster doses you give, you cannot convert a disease-blocking vaccine into an infection-blocking vaccine,"" Poland said. Whatever the United States decides will likely influence decisions about boosters in other parts of the world, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""I think you'll probably see a trend in high-income countries to boost if the FDA grants them,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Privacy alarm in Indonesia over president's leaked vaccine certificate,2347,"JAKARTA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A leak online of the president's COVID-19 vaccine certificate has heightened concern in Indonesia about information security, coming in the same week as a data breach affecting 1.3 million users of a government contact-tracing application President Joko Widodo's vaccine records were accessed using the app, PeduliLindungi (care protect), and shared widely on social media, raising questions among experts about the government's commitment to data security. Digital analyst Ismail Fahmi said the leak showed how easy it was to view or potentially use another individual's vaccination certificate, even that of a head of state. ""If there was protection, there would be an investigation into why this problem persists, why personal records can be easily mined,"" he said. ""But there is no such protection."" Health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin on Friday said officials' records could no longer be accessed. Some social media users expressed dismay over flaws in the application, which was last month made mandatory. ""I trust the government's apps less and less after this,"" said a Twitter user under the handle @delrellove. Another user, Denny Siregar, who has more than a million followers, said: ""Our data protection is very low. Even the president's got leaked."" The application includes private biodata and displays vaccination dates and types administered. Its use is required for air travel and entering malls. Fadjroel Rachman, a presidential spokesman, said his office regretted the breach. ""We hope that relevant authorities can conduct certain procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening, including the protection of the people's data,"" he said. A data protection bill was submitted to parliament last year but has yet to be passed. The government on Tuesday said it was investigating a problem in an earlier version of the app that exposed data of about 1.3 million people. L4N2Q219C It came a few months after an alleged breach of social security data by a state insurer. ""The problem is still the same, there is no grand strategy to protect citizen data,"" said Damar Juniarto of digital advocacy group SAFEnet.

Caribbean tourism recovery punctured by new coronavirus spike,3613,"KINGSTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Just as tourism was beginning to show signs of recovery, the Caribbean has been hit by a new wave of coronavirus infections that is causing lockdowns and flight cancellations and overwhelming hospitals. Countries including Jamaica, Martinique, The Bahamas, Barbados, St. Lucia, and Dominica have seen a rise in cases fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant and a relaxation of earlier restrictions. Misinformation spread on social media has also contributed to a low vaccine uptake. The Caribbean is one of the regions most dependent on tourism, with nine countries in the world's top 20, according to an index compiled by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Many experienced double-digit declines in gross domestic product (GDP) growth when COVID-19 struck, drying up tourism dollars, destroying jobs and hurting their balance of payments. Since the latest wave of COVID-19 hit Dominica and the government ordered a lockdown - now lifted - business has been slow for Nahgie Laflouf, operations manager for adventure company Extreme Dominica on the island of some 70,000 people. ""Things are gone back a bit quiet,"" said Laflouf, who takes tourists hiking and rafting among Dominica's lush forests and waterfalls. ""They had started to pick up before the spike."" In August, there were four or five tours, when they might have had three times that before the COVID jump, Laflouf said. The outbreak has prompted governments to impose restrictions including curfews and mandatory vaccinations as they deal with too few hospital beds, low levels of oxygen and exhausted healthcare workers. Some countries, like the Cayman Islands, shut their borders to tourists, but others like Jamaica continued to welcome them, allowing the country of 3 million people to salvage some earnings. ""We have to double up our efforts to manage,"" Jamaican Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett told Reuters. ""The region is now on alert to deal with visitor hesitancy."" Jamaica's foreign exchange earnings from tourism fell $2.5 billion last year, a 74% drop from 2019, the government says. The IDB said vaccines are crucial to getting tourism back to normal and forecast that recovery to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity could take up until 2024 in some countries. Vaccine rollout in the Caribbean has been slow due to vaccine skepticism, logistical hold-ups and inadequate supply. Jamaica has administered enough doses to give two shots to about 9% of the population, data compiled by Reuters show. Since the start of July, new COVID-19 cases more than tripled and now stand above 69,000, while hospitalizations have risen almost sevenfold. Total cases in The Bahamas have jumped by almost half since the beginning of July. Active cases in Dominica skyrocketed from five on July 7 to 638 on Aug. 27. In Martinique, the French government announced a three-week lockdown on Aug. 10 and asked tourists to leave the country. ""Most of the shops are closed down, most of them have to put people on layoff,"" 41-year-old Cristal Joseph said by phone from the town of Le Lamentin, Martinique. In St. Lucia, infections are up eighteen-fold to over 1,900 since July 9, the Pan-American Health Organization said. Concerns that St. Lucia could end up on Britain's COVID-19 'red list' - which imposes an expensive quarantine on Britons returning from such nations - are hurting tourism, said Norbert Williams, a spokesman for the opposition United Workers Party. ""There have been a number of cancellations going into the Christmas season,"" said Williams. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Australian PM seeks quicker reopening after COVID-19 vaccine swap with Britain,2922,"SYDNEY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Australia will receive an additional 4 million doses of Pfizer's (PFE.N) COVID-19 vaccine this month after agreeing a swap deal with Britain, to help accelerate its vaccination programme amid a record surge in infections.

Australia on Friday recorded its biggest one-day rise in COVID-19 infections, with 1,657 new cases and 13 deaths reported in the past 24 hours. ""On a difficult day like this, it’s important to bring hope. And, I can assure you, there is hope,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""This will enable us to bring forward significantly the opportunity for Australia to open up again."" Australia agreed a similar swap arrangement with Singapore earlier this week. Both deals will see Australia return Pfizer vaccines later in the year when the bulk of Canberra's order is delivered. ""Our agreement with Australia will share doses at the optimum time to bolster both our countries’ vaccination programmes,"" Sajid Javid, Britain's Health Secretary, said in an emailed statement.

Britain set to raise taxes to pay for social care - reports,2795,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The British government is planning a tax hike for around 25 million people to help fund adult social care and the National Health Service, newspapers reported on Friday. The state-run National Health Service (NHS), which has provided healthcare that's free at the point of use for more than 70 years, is a hugely emotive issue and successive governments have avoided tackling the challenge of how to meet the growing costs of funding adult social care. The Telegraph and The Times said the government was looking at hiking National Insurance social security contribution rates by between 1 and 2 percentage points in return for capping the amount an individual would have to spend on social care costs in their lifetime. ""Work is going on and I'm sure we will hear the outcomes very soon,"" justice minister Robert Buckland told Sky News when asked about the reports. ""No final decisions have been made."" The move would break a 2019 election promise by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives not to raise the rate of income tax, the VAT sales tax or National Insurance. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have got to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Buckland told BBC News. After winning the 2019 election with a big parliamentary majority, Johnson said he had a ""clear plan"" to fix the crisis in social care. But his agenda was soon eclipsed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports said an announcement could come next week. Before an election in 2017, Johnson's predecessor Theresa May saw her party's large lead in opinion polls dwindle after she proposed that people should pay more of the costs of social care which opponents dubbed a ""dementia tax"". Johnson's office favours a 1% rise in the tax, while the finance ministry is possibly looking at a higher rate of up to 1.25%, the Telegraph reported. The Times said health minister Sajid Javid had pushed for as much as a 2% rise. The opposition Labour Party said the move would hit low earners, young people and business. The Telegraph said that in return for the higher contributions, the government would cap the amount a person spends on social care costs during their lifetime, possibly at between 60,000 pounds ($83,010) and 80,000 pounds. It would also raise the level of assets an individual could hold while also receiving government help to cover social care costs. Both measures were aimed at better protecting people from having to sell their home to pay for care, the Telegraph said. The package would also include extra funding for the NHS to help tackle waiting lists which have spiralled during the COVID-19 pandemic, the report added.

The state-run National Health Service (NHS), which has provided healthcare that's free at the point of use for more than 70 years, is a hugely emotive issue and successive governments have avoided tackling the challenge of how to meet the growing costs of funding adult social care. The Telegraph and The Times said the government was looking at hiking National Insurance social security contribution rates by between 1 and 2 percentage points in return for capping the amount an individual would have to spend on social care costs in their lifetime. ""Work is going on and I'm sure we will hear the outcomes very soon,"" justice minister Robert Buckland told Sky News when asked about the reports. ""No final decisions have been made."" The move would break a 2019 election promise by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives not to raise the rate of income tax, the VAT sales tax or National Insurance. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have got to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Buckland told BBC News. After winning the 2019 election with a big parliamentary majority, Johnson said he had a ""clear plan"" to fix the crisis in social care. But his agenda was soon eclipsed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports said an announcement could come next week. Before an election in 2017, Johnson's predecessor Theresa May saw her party's large lead in opinion polls dwindle after she proposed that people should pay more of the costs of social care which opponents dubbed a ""dementia tax"". Johnson's office favours a 1% rise in the tax, while the finance ministry is possibly looking at a higher rate of up to 1.25%, the Telegraph reported. The Times said health minister Sajid Javid had pushed for as much as a 2% rise. The opposition Labour Party said the move would hit low earners, young people and business. The Telegraph said that in return for the higher contributions, the government would cap the amount a person spends on social care costs during their lifetime, possibly at between 60,000 pounds ($83,010) and 80,000 pounds. It would also raise the level of assets an individual could hold while also receiving government help to cover social care costs. Both measures were aimed at better protecting people from having to sell their home to pay for care, the Telegraph said. The package would also include extra funding for the NHS to help tackle waiting lists which have spiralled during the COVID-19 pandemic, the report added.

U.S. shipped more than 2 mln COVID-19 doses to Kenya and Ghana,1033,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday shipped more than 2 million doses of Moderna's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine to Kenya and Ghana on Thursday through the COVAX global distribution program, a White House official said. The United States sent 880,320 doses to Kenya, bringing the total number of doses sent to the African country to just over 1.76 million, the official said. It sent 1,229,620 doses to Ghana, the first shipment to that country. Thursday's shipments were the latest installments in a U.S. vaccine diplomacy push that has sent vaccines to dozens of countries. The doses are being delivered through COVAX, jointly run by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).

Israeli troops shoot Palestinian dead in Gaza border clashes,2003,"GAZA/TEL AVIV, Sept 2 (Reuters) - (This Sept. 2 story corrects paragraph eight to add Hamas member) Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian along the Gaza border on Thursday as hundreds set fire to tyres and threw stones, Gaza's health ministry said. The Israeli military said that over 1,000 Palestinians had gathered along the fortified frontier, hurling explosives and setting tyres ablaze. ""IDF (Israeli military) troops deployed in the area are using riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire and .22 Caliber rounds,"" the military said in a statement. Gaza's health ministry said the man killed had been shot in the abdomen. Five others were wounded by Israeli fire, including a child who is in critical condition, it said. Sanctioned by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas, Palestinians have staged nightly protests along the border this week to voice anger at an Israeli-led blockade of the territory. Israel cites threats from Hamas for the restrictions. The protests add to a recent rise in cross-border violence that has tested a fragile truce that ended 11 days of deadly Israel-Hamas fighting in May. Since the Egyptian-mediated ceasefire, Palestinians have sporadically sent balloons carrying incendiary material into Israel, igniting brush fires and drawing Israeli air strikes on Hamas facilities in Gaza.

EXCLUSIVE U.S. funding tapped for Pacific undersea cable after China rebuffed,4160,"SYDNEY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The Federated States of Micronesia will tap a U.S. funding facility to construct a Pacific undersea communications cable, two sources told Reuters, after rejecting a Chinese company-led proposal that was deemed a security threat by U.S. officials. The United States has taken great interest in several plans in recent years to lay optic fibre cables across the Pacific, projects that would bring vastly improved communications to island nations. The undersea cables have far greater data capacity than satellites, leading Washington to raise concerns that the involvement of Chinese firms would compromise regional security. Beijing has consistently denied any intent to use cable infrastructure for spying. Two sources with knowledge of the plans said FSM would use U.S. funds to construct a line between two of its four states, Kosrae to Pohnpei, replicating part of a route proposed under a previous $72.6 million project backed by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Reuters reported in June that project, which also encompassed Nauru and Kiribati, was scuppered after Washington raised concerns the contract would be awarded to Huawei Marine, now called HMN Technologies and majority owned by Shanghai-listed Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd. read more . One source told Reuters that FSM would draw around $14 million from the American Rescue Plan, a U.S. facility created by President Joe Biden to distribute funds both at home and abroad to combat the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. FSM said it was committed to providing fibre connectivity to the State of Kosrae, and onward connectivity to Kiribati and Nauru. It did not respond directly to questions about U.S. funding. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. The United States and FSM have a long geopolitical relationship, enshrined in the Compact of Free Association, a decades-old agreement between the United States and its former Pacific trust territories. Under that agreement, Washington is responsible for the island nation's defence. The second source said the U.S. funded cable would likely connect to the HANTRU-1 undersea cable, a line primarily used by the U.S. government that connects to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The World Bank said in a statement it was working with FSM and Kiribati to map out their next steps after the original tender for the larger project concluded with no contract awarded. PACIFIC POLITICS Undersea cables represent one of the newest and most sensitive fronts in the rivalry between China and the U.S. in the strategic waters of the Pacific. While FSM has close ties to the United States, it also has long-standing diplomatic and trade relations with China. Prominent U.S. lawmakers have warned that Chinese companies could undermine competitive tenders by offering state-subsidised bids Reuters previously reported. read more The U.S. Commerce Department publicly lists Huawei Marine on its so-called ""Entity List"" - known as a blacklist - which restricts the sale of U.S. goods and technology to the company. The Department told Reuters that Huawei's new owner, HMN Tech, would also be captured under these restrictions. China has strongly refuted the allegations. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters that Chinese companies had a good record in cybersecurity. ""The so-called security threat [alleged] by the U.S. is totally groundless, and has ulterior motives,"" the statement said. ""Who the 'hacker empire' really is - engaging in spying and stealing secrets - is plain to the world."" Australia, a strong regional ally to the United States, has ramped up its presence in the Pacific through the creation of a A$2 billion ($1.48 billion) infrastructure financing facility that island nations can potentially access for cable projects. Nauru has been negotiating plans to tap into the Australian-backed Coral Sea Cable system, via Solomon Islands, sources told Reuters in June. read more ($1 = 1.3510 Australian dollars) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Fall of Japan PM Suga triggered by criticism over pandemic, failure to communicate",2615,"TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - When Yoshihide Suga took over as Japan's prime minister last year, hopes were high that skills honed over years as a keen backroom operator, and a common touch from his rural roots, would enable him to lead his nation through the pandemic. Instead, the virus surged back amid a rocky vaccination rollout and a series of ""states of emergency"" that did little to stop the spread of the more contagious Delta variant. Suga, 72, also insisted on holding the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, postponed from last year, despite widespread public opposition. But his support rates sank below 30% ahead of a ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership race and general election this year. On Friday, facing a revolt inside his own party, Suga said he would step down to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for his replacement as premier after just one year in office. Known for his steely gaze and sharp, sometimes irritable, replies during news conferences as chief cabinet secretary and right-hand man to predecessor Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Suga took over in September 2020 when Abe abruptly quit, citing health problems. His image as a savvy political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74 percent when he took office. Initially, populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments were applauded. He also set up a digital agency to unify central and local government technology systems, an area where Japan has lagged. But removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a his junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism. His delay in halting the ""Go To"" domestic travel programme - which experts say probably helped spread the coronavirus - hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses. Perceptions that he was more focused on hosting the Olympics than the pandemic also eroded support, although authorities have denied any link between the Games and the spike in infections. Critics blamed poor communications skills at news conferences in parliament for failing to unite the public behind largely voluntary pandemic restrictions. By August, when the Olympics closed, Suga's support had slid below 30%, alarming party leaders and junior lawmakers ahead of an election for the powerful lower house of parliament that must be held this year and leading to talk about unseating him.

S.Korea extends distancing curbs ahead of thanksgiving holiday,2054,"SEOUL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South Korea on Friday extended social distancing curbs for several weeks to rein in COVID-19 outbreaks nationwide as the country supercharges its vaccination campaign ahead of a thanksgiving holiday later this month. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said the toughest level 4 restrictions in greater Seoul and level 3 curbs in the rest of the country would run through to Oct. 3. However, he also announced that restaurants and cafes in the greater Seoul area would be allowed to close an hour later each evening and families would be allowed to gather in groups of up to eight people in the week of the Sept. 21 Chuseok holiday. Kim has been balancing providing incentives for people to get vaccinated with reining in an outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant that started in July. read more The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 1,709 new COVID-19 cases for Thursday, 1,675 of which were locally acquired. Korea has recorded a total of 257,110 infections since the pandemic started, with 2,308 deaths. The Health Ministry said the current outbreak is likely to intensify in early September, possibly peaking at 2,300 daily cases, before subsiding toward the end of the month. That would surpass the record2,223 cases reported on Aug 11. ""We fear a spike in outbreaks from increased movement around the Chuseok holiday,"" Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol told a briefing. The allowance for eight people to gather for Chuseok is dependent on at least four having completed their vaccination, and in greater Seoul will be restricted to house gatherings. Kwon said the government plans to deliver a first vaccine dose to 70% of the 52 million population by Chuseok, and complete inoculation for half the population by the end of September. Around 58% of the population has currently received one dose, with about 33% fully vaccinated.

New Zealand sees success in curbing Delta outbreak as new cases plunge,1737,"WELLINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported 28 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, a big drop compared to the last few days, as authorities said the country was breaking the chain of transmission of the highly infectious Delta variant of coronavirus. Authorities said 27 new cases were in Auckland and one was in Wellington. Friday's numbers were lower than 49 new cases reported on Thursday and 75 the day before. ""While the fall is encouraging we are mindful these outbreaks can have a long tail...,"" Director of Public Health Dr Caroline McEnlay said in a news conference. ""We are being successful in breaking the chain of transmission,"" she said. Barring a few cases in February, New Zealand had been largely free of coronavirus until the Delta outbreak prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order the snap lockdown last month. About 1.7 million people in the largest city of Auckland still remain in strict level 4 lockdown. Curbs have been eased in the rest of the countries but schools and offices as well as cafe, restaurants and all public venues remain shut. Most New Zealanders have been asked to stay indoors. Ardern's lockdowns and international border closure since March 2020 have been credited with reining in COVID-19, largely freeing up day-to-day activities from curbs. But the government faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout that has left a majority of the population exposed to the latest outbreak. Just over a quarter of New Zealand's 5.1 million people have been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping.

First Katrina and now Ida: Some residents think about giving up,3639,"GRAND ISLE, La., Sept 2 (Reuters) - Jim King, 75, surveyed the damage to his home on Grand Isle, Louisiana, on Thursday, a house he rebuilt himself after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago. Hurricane Ida wrought new havoc this week. King said he and his wife have just about had enough. He was stuck on the deck of his home after Hurricane Ida ripped off the stairs that gave him access to the road below. He flagged down a helicopter and asked for a ladder to descend to the road. ""These storms are only going to get more powerful,"" King said, marooned on his deck after the steps leading to the road below were obliterated by Ida. He said his wife wants to talk about ""whether we continue to live here. And I agree."" King spoke as shattered communities across southern Louisiana were still assessing storm damage from Ida on Thursday as floodwaters had yet to recede in many places four days after the hurricane knocked out power to a million homes and businesses. The Category 4 hurricane came ashore on the barrier islands and swampy lowlands known as the bayou, where many small towns are difficult to reach even without roads being clogged with fallen trees, power lines and debris hurled about by gusts of wind that reached 172 miles per hour (276 kph). Ida leveled Grand Isle, a town of 740 on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico, where officials said virtually every structure sustained damage and about 40% were destroyed. About three feet (one meter) of sand covered the island, rendering it uninhabitable. Around 600,000 people had no water and another 400,000 were advised to boil their tap water before drinking it, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said. At least nine deaths have been reported. On Grand Isle many had roofs blown off and some were reduced to rubble. Downed power lines lay tangled along the only road onto the island where Paul Delise, 52, owns a vacation home. ""The inside is all tore up. I don't know if it's restorable,"" he said. ""Nobody around here has seen anything like this. I lived through Katrina and as bad as it was it wasn't a wind event like this. This place is never going to be back how it was."" Kendall Simoneaux, 49, a maintenance worker at the Hurricane Hole Hotel on the island, said his team planned to bring in excavators and bulldozers. ""The debris is easy to pick up but it's the sand. It's heavy. It's almost like cement,"" he said. Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng told a news conference after flying over Grand Isle and the rest of Ida's path on Wednesday that the community was ""broken."" ""We don't have electricity. We don't have communication. We don't have gas or water, and sewer systems are very fragile,"" Lee Sheng said. Wrecked neighborhoods looked like ""a little pile of matchsticks,"" she added. President Joe Biden was scheduled to survey the destruction for himself on Friday, when Edwards said he would present a long lists of needs. Louisiana hospitals were already crowded with COVID-19 patients and short of nurses before Ida. Edwards said 2,447 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized on Wednesday, including 446 on ventilators. The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday that four nursing home residents who had been evacuated to a warehouse used as a shelter in Tangipahoa Parish recently died, with three of the deaths related to the hurricane, and one under investigation. The department said it was investigating seven nursing homes for sending over 800 residents to the warehouse, where conditions were so bad a rescue operation had to be launched to remove them from the facility.

South Carolina Supreme Court strikes down city's school mask mandate,2276,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Carolina's Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a school mask mandate in the state's capital city in the midst of its largest surge in COVID-19 cases since last winter. In the latest of several such legal cases across a nation where cultural and political clashes have erupted over the COVID-19 response, the court ruled 5-0 to issue a declaratory judgment for South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who brought the case against the city of Columbia. Wilson, a Republican, argued a state law that allows parents to decide whether their children wear masks in school trumps the city's mask mandate ordinance for private and public elementary and middle school students and staff. The emergency school mask ordinance, brought by Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin in response to the surge in infections, had been approved by the city council in Columbia two weeks ago. The ordinance, which also applied to daycare centers, was aimed at children too young to be vaccinated. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said in a tweet that the court had come to ""a sound conclusion"" based on the rule of law. ""A parent's right to decide what's best for their child is now definitively protected by state law,"" he said, while encouraging residents to get vaccinated. Benjamin, a Democrat, said in a statement that the city ""will always act to preserve and protect the lives, health and safety of our children. This is a sad day for children in South Carolina."" The justices wrote in their opinion that they ""fully recognize that strong and passionate opinions exist on both sides of this debate,"" but are constitutionally bound to only interpret and apply existing laws and not make policy. The South Carolina legislature in June passed a provision in the state budget prohibiting cities from enacting mask mandates. Two weeks ago, the Texas Supreme Court rejected Governor Greg Abbott's attempt to suspend a mask mandate. A state judge in Florida last week ruled that Governor Ron DeSantis' administration cannot ban public school districts from requiring face masks. Southern states, including South Carolina, have seen a recent spike in COVID-19 cases, partly due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Texas abortion ban injects new urgency into U.S. election campaigns,6910,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sept 2 (Reuters) - After the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to block a near-total ban on abortions by Texas, alarmed Democratic candidates and abortion rights advocates had a single, urgent message for voters on Thursday: Abortion rights are on the ballot. Within hours of the court's decision, Democrats running in gubernatorial elections in California and Virginia this year warned their Republican rivals would outlaw abortion if they won, while making impassioned fundraising appeals. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-controlled chamber will vote to protect abortion rights nationwide later this month, but that faces uncertain prospects in the Senate. For decades, Democrats have sounded the alarm about potential Republican attacks on abortion rights in the states and in the courts, often to their political benefit. But now, the threat is no longer ""hypothetical,"" said Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for the Democratic State Legislative Committee, which aims to elect Democrats to state legislatures. While fearful about the Supreme Court's willingness to consider challenges to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Democratic groups hope that the issue will galvanize moderate suburban voters and women to turn out in off-year elections, which will decide control of Congress and many state legislatures. Aside from Texas, four other Republican-led states have also passed laws that outlaw all or nearly all abortions, and the Republican president of the Florida state Senate said on Thursday he would try to pass a similar ban. ""This should be a warning to all states in America they could go the way of Texas,"" Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Republicans, by contrast, largely avoided commenting on the decision. Several Republican groups responsible for winning congressional and legislative elections likewise did not respond to a request for comment. About 52 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36 percent think it should be illegal, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support abortion rights, though support has risen somewhat among both groups in recent years. While Republicans have harnessed conservatives' anti-abortion views to their advantage in past elections, Democrats could benefit this time around if they see abortion rights directly under threat, political analysts said. On Thursday, the Democratic Governors Association asked for donations to help protect reproductive rights in this year's gubernatorial races in Virginia, New Jersey and California. ""The threat wasn't real enough until recently to trigger mobilization on the left,"" said University of Michigan political scientist Nicholas Valentino, who cautioned that the November 2022 elections were still far off. Between now and the end of 2022, voters will elect governors in 38 states, as well as 91 of the 99 legislative chambers. Control of both chambers of Congress will also be at stake. The first of those elections is in California on Sept. 14, where Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom faces a possible recall. Newsom's campaign plans to work with abortion rights advocates to ensure that Democratic voters don't stay home that day, spokesman Nathan Click said. ""Texas has effectively banned a woman's right to choose,"" Newsom said on Twitter. ""This could be the future of CA if we don't vote NO on the Republican Recall by 9/14."" In Virginia, which votes for governor and state assembly in November, McAuliffe's campaign has released two ads saying Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin wants to ban abortion and will continue hammering him on that point, his campaign said. Youngkin's campaign responded by calling McAuliffe a ""pro-abortion extremist"" on Twitter. Youngkin has said he opposes abortion but has not made it a major focus of his campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said he did not think the Texas law alone was enough to ignite widespread revolt against Republicans in suburbs around the state. ""There needs to be a Trump-esque type of threat to the Democrats, and that would have to be the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Stein said. DEMOCRATS STRUGGLE IN STATES The Supreme Court ruling highlights Democrats' struggles to make gains outside of Washington in an era of growing political polarization. Party officials privately acknowledge that they have not paid enough attention to state races over the past decade after Republicans have consolidated gains at that level. Democrats raised a record $51 million to devote to legislative races last year, but still failed to win control in their targeted states of Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Republicans control the governor's mansion and the legislature in 23 of the 50 states and are poised to use redistricting to lock in their advantage over the coming decade. Democrats control 15 states and partisan advantage is divided in the remainder. The divide on abortion is especially stark. State legislatures enacted a record 90 abortion restrictions in the first half of the year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Almost all of those laws, including several that ban abortions entirely, were passed in Republican-controlled states. Many Democratic-controlled states, meanwhile, have expanded abortion access. Texas represents a particular frustration for Democrats, who have seen a growing minority population as an opportunity to flip the most populous Republican-led state. But they have repeatedly come up short in state contests, and this week the Republican-led legislature passed new restrictions on voting and an expansion of gun rights. Republicans said opinion polls show that voters support what they have been doing. ""All indications are that Texas voters believe in protecting easy and fraud-resistant access to polls, they believe in the protection of life ... they believe in the right to self defense,"" said James Dickey, a former head of the Texas Republican Party. Democratic strategists say the Supreme Court decision could help their candidates in suburban areas that have trended away from the Republicans in recent years. ""Republicans for years have been competing against one another to be more and more extreme,"" said Mike Collier, a Democrat who is challenging incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick in Texas. ""They are creating tremendous, tremendous political liabilities."""

"Reed back in action, feared for his life during hospital stay",2064,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Former Masters champion Patrick Reed returned to action at the season-ending Tour Championship on Thursday in Atlanta after a recent hospital stay for bilateral pneumonia that he revealed left him fearing for his life. After playing his first competitive round in 25 days, Reed spent plenty of time during his post-round news conference at East Lake discussing an illness that resulted in a week-long stay at a Houston hospital. ""First couple days they were sitting there telling me that make sure you text your family quite a bit, talk to your family, because you just don't know. I mean, this is not good. We're not in a good spot right now,"" Reed told reporters. ""The only thing that was going through my mind is, I'm not going to be able to tell my kids goodbye. I'm not going to be able to tell them I love them. I'm not going to be able to tell my wife that I love her and give her a hug."" A nine-times winner of the PGA Tour, Reed said he was happy not to show any ill-effects after having missed the first two events of the FedExCup Playoffs. Reed, who only resumed practice on Monday and was the 30th and final man to make the field at the Tour Championship, shot a two-over-par 72 at East Lake but was well off the pace due in large part to a staggered scoring system for the finale. ""As a whole, I feel optimistic, obviously with the way I finished, getting through 18 and not feeling like my health is hindering me,"" Reed said. Reed added he probably would not be playing this week if it were not for his determination to earn a spot on the U.S. team to play Europe in the Sept. 24-26 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin. Having not secured an automatic spot on the team, Reed is hoping to convince U.S. captain Steve Stricker to make him one of the remaining six players selected. ""Honestly, the biggest thing is, talking with Stricks and stuff, is just making sure I'm healthy and I think the biggest thing for me this week is just to see kind of where I'm at,"" said Reed.

U.S. Senator Manchin wants a pause in Democrats' push for $3.5 trillion spending bill,3054,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Senator Joe Manchin on Thursday urged fellow Democrats to pause in their push to enact a $3.5 trillion spending bill encompassing much of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, casting doubt on whether and when they will be able to advance the package. ""Instead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and additional stimulus funding, Congress should hit a strategic pause on the budget-reconciliation legislation,"" Manchin, a moderate West Virginia lawmaker, wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate are currently crafting legislation to fill in the details of a $3.5 trillion spending outline that both chambers approved last month. The package, which Democratic leaders hope to pass in the coming weeks along with a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, would advance progressives' ambitious plans to fight climate change and expand childcare, healthcare and other social programs. But Democrats need to keep the party unified to get both plans through. ""I for one, won't support a $3.5 trillion bill, or anywhere near that level of additional spending, without greater clarity about why Congress chooses to ignore the serious effects inflation and debt have on existing government programs,"" Manchin wrote in the Journal. It was not the first time he has said the spending plan's price tag was too high. He also did so shortly after voting to advance the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint last month, saying he was worried about the ""grave consequences"" of such spending on the nation's debt as well as the country's ability to respond to other potential crises. Biden's Democrats have literally no votes to spare if they are to push the spending legislation through Congress this autumn. They are seeking to advance it in the 50-50 Senate through a special budget reconciliation process that would allow it to pass with a simple majority in the chamber, where legislation usually requires 60 votes to advance. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote. Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the House as well, and with no Republican support expected for the $3.5 trillion plan, Manchin's opinion - or that of any single Democratic lawmaker - matters. Another moderate Democrat, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, has also said she will not support $3.5 trillion in spending. Manchin's opinion piece appeared a day after he made similar comments to the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. Progressive Democrats - many of whom have threatened not to back the $1 trillion infrastructure plan if the $3.5 trillion spending package does not pass the Senate - responded forcefully. ""Pause on finally delivering child care, paid leave, education, health care, affordable housing, climate action, and dental, vision, and hearing to millions of families across America?

Medtech firm Baxter to buy hospital-bed maker Hill-Rom for $10.5 bln,2024,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. medtech firm Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) said on Thursday it would buy rival Hill-Rom Holdings Inc (HRC.N) for about $10.5 billion, adding smart hospital beds to its portfolio of patient monitoring and diagnostic products. Baxter said it would pay $156 per Hill-Rom share, a premium of 7.5% to the stock's last close. Hill-Rom shares were trading up 3% at 149.85 before the bell on Thursday, while Baxter shares rose 1%. Media reports had earlier said the companies had been in talks for months and Hill-Rom in July had rejected a $144 per share offer from Baxter, deeming it too low. On Monday, Reuters reported the companies were nearing a deal. Medical equipment makers in recent months have broadened their offerings through acquisitions to cash in on the sector's recovery from the pandemic-driven slump last year. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc in April agreed to buy contract researcher PPD Inc (PPD.O) for $17.4 billion, while Medtronic (MDT.N) recently snapped up Intersect ENT (XENT.O) in a $936.2 million deal. Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter's business grew in the pandemic due to demand for its renal blood purification systems devices PrisMax and Prismaflex, but has been hit by rising costs and stiffer competition for some products. 106-year-old Hill-Rom makes most of its revenue from its patient support systems, which include smart hospital beds that use sensors and other technology to help monitor patients. Baxter expects the deal, worth about $12.4 billion including debt, to close early next year and to help grow earnings by more than 20% within the three years after. However, analysts have presented a mixed view of the deal, with some saying investors could be concerned about Hill-Rom not having fast-growing revenue. ""The key to share performance will depend on how well Baxter can articulate the strategic rationale and allay fears of growth dilution,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a note on Monday.

(Reuters) - Epstein Becker Green has opened a new office in Columbus, Ohio, and has poached a 12-partner team focused on healthcare from Bricker & Eckler. The team joining the more than 300-lawyer firm will be led by partners Jennifer Nelson Carney, Stephen Kleinman, and James Petrie. They will be based in Epstein Becker's 16th national office, the first in Ohio, and will focus on healthcare, labor and employment, and litigation. “Healthcare, labor and employment lawyers in a group that were aspiring to bring their talents on to a national platform was why we were attracted to the conversation,” said Mark Lutes, chair of the firm's board of directors. Carney, former chair of Bricker & Eckler’s Health Care group and now a partner at Epstein Becker, said that the firm’s specialized health and life sciences focus drew the team to the firm. She said that the veteran team is eager to partner with Epstein Becker's attorneys now that community hospitals, which used to make up a large portion of the team's practice, are becoming parts of sophisticated healthcare systems with complex needs. “We were excited to expand our platform, beyond Ohio, and to tap into the great federal resources that Epstein Becker has,” said Carney. In a Thursday memo, Jim Flynn, managing partner of Bricker & Eckler, which has seven offices in Ohio and about 130 attorneys, said that he wished the team well. “Make no mistake, Bricker & Eckler remains strong and very well-equipped to provide our clients with excellent personal service and outstanding value,” wrote Flynn. Flynn will take over as head of Bricker & Eckler’s healthcare practice, a position he held in the past, in addition to acting as the firm's managing partner, according to the memo.

Walmart's wage bump signals pressure to raise pay in industry battle for labor,4452,"CHICAGO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (WMT.N) move on Thursday to give 565,000 of its U.S. store workers raises of at least $1 puts the spotlight on the industry's tight, competitive labor market as the all-important holiday shopping season is set to kick off. Worth nearly $800 billion last year in the United States alone, the holidays mark the busiest time of the year for stores, making up a majority of their annual sales as people shop on and around Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas. Retailers hire tens of thousands of temporary workers across the country to keep up with crowds of people in stores and online, paying competitive wages and offering benefits. Last year, for instance, big-box rival Target provided a coronavirus health plan and paid workers $15 an hour, versus $13 an hour in 2019. But a nationwide worker shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic has retailers concerned they will not have enough workers in stores and warehouses to handle to extra sales online and in stores. ""The biggest challenge for retailers going into the holiday season is going to be how do they get the sales associates and the warehouse workers in position to fulfill demand,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of consultancy Kearney. With its third wage hike over the past year, Walmart's U.S. average hourly wage is now $16.40, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive John Furner said in a memo to staff. The mean hourly wage for retail salespeople is $14.87, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers in Walmart's shop floor, food and consumable and general merchandise departments will receive the higher wages, effective Sept. 25, Furner said. 'POVERTY WAGES' The hike in pay wasn't enough for some workers who have long fought for more money. ""When Walmart touts its average pay at $16.40 an hour, it distracts from the reality that its business model still relies on poverty wages,"" said Cynthia Murray, 65, a 20-year Walmart worker from Laurel, Maryland, and a member of labor group United for Respect. Murray called for Walmart's minimum wage to increase to $15 an hour at minimum, at a time when workers face ongoing risk of contracting the virus. For others, however, it's not all about pay. In July, Walmart said it would pay 100% of college tuition and book costs for its associates. That policy is what is keeping Cincinnati, Ohio-based Jacob, 19, around as the retailer pays his tuition for a correspondence course in business administration at Southern New Hampshire University. ""Once I graduate college, I do plan on finding a better job,"" said Jacob, who declined to provide his last name out of fear of losing his job. 'BACK INTO THE HARNESS' The news comes days before the national end of federal unemployment benefits, which has been anticipated by employers who hope a lot of people once scared by COVID will return to the workforce. ""This is significant. I mean, if you look at it in percentage terms it's not much, but this is Walmart - they don't really do this,"" said Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington. ""Companies are having trouble getting people back into the harness after being out for so long and this is another sign that the labor market is readjusting."" Smaller retailers aren't immune to the issue either. Chicago's Abt Electronics, a household name in Illinois, said it has raised its minimum wage by just over 10%. Worker wages and benefits are the most expensive operational cost for many retailers, whose workers have long fought for higher wages through unions and organizations including Fight for $15. Unions have shone a spotlight this year on pay in the industry, a issue that received tremendous attention after an attempt by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers to organize at a warehouse in Alabama. A Reuters analysis of two decades of wage data showed earlier this year that workers in unions reap higher wages. Walmart, which is not unionized, raised pay for more than 425,000 stocking and digital associates earlier this year. It said on Wednesday it plans to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division. Dollar General (DG.N) said this week it is looking to hire more workers and truck drivers to whom it is offering a $5,000 sign-on bonus. Target, Best Buy and other major retailers have yet to announce any holiday wage increases or benefits. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Greenberg Traurig taps ex-FDA associate chief litigation counsel,2739,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Greenberg Traurig on Thursday announced it had tapped a U.S. Food and Drug Administration litigator for its health care and litigation practices. James Fraser has joined Greenberg Traurig as a shareholder after serving as the FDA's associate chief counsel for litigation for five years. Prior to joining the FDA in 2016, Fraser was at Venable for 11 years. ""This was a great landing spot for me. I could not be happier to be here at Greenberg Traurig,"" Fraser said. He will work in both the firm's health care & FDA practice and its litigation practice. Fraser represented the FDA and worked with the U.S. Department of Justice in litigation as companies challenged the agency's decision-making on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other products. He also filed civil enforcement actions against companies for allegedly violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Now back in private practice, Fraser said he hopes to leverage his FDA experience in advising life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical and medical device firms, in complex product liability cases or in litigation with the agency. Fraser won't be among strangers. In May, Greenberg Traurig welcomed back one of his former colleagues -- Robert Charrow, the general counsel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- as the senior chairman of its health care & FDA practice. Fraser also counts Lori Cohen, the vice chair of the firm and the co-chair of its global litigation practice, as a friend, having worked on the same side in pharmaceutical product liability litigation. Fraser's departure from the FDA comes three months after his boss, Stacy Cline Amin, the former FDA chief counsel during the Trump administration, joined Morrison & Foerster as the co-leader of its FDA regulatory and compliance practice. Amin started that role in June. Fraser's arrival at Greenberg Traurig comes a day after the firm announced it had recruited John Houghton, the former global co-chair of Latham's restructuring and special situations practice and its former European head of the same practice. Houghton is now chair of Greenberg Traurig's London restructuring and bankruptcy practice.

U.S. President Joe Biden looks on during a meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The White House has called for the ""codification"" of abortion rights that are currently protected by the court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision through legislation in Congress, but has not outlined any specific steps that it is taking to back any such law. A plurality of Americans believe that abortion should be legal up until the fetus is capable of living on its own, and they remain largely supportive of Roe v. Wade, a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June showed. The responses are split along party lines, with 70% of Democrats, 35% of Republicans and 47% of independents agreeing abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Biden's Democrats have control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with slim majorities and he is seeking to push through legislation on infrastructure and other Democratic priorities in the coming weeks. The House will debate and vote on legislation stopping states from enacting restrictive anti-abortion regulations like the one just approved by Texas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday. read more"
U.S. to invest $3 bln in COVID-19 vaccine supply chain -White House official,2087,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. plans to invest $3 billion in the vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position itself as a leading supplier of vaccines for the world, a top U.S. health official said on Thursday. The funding, which will begin to be distributed in the coming weeks, will focus on manufacturers of the inputs used in COVID-19 vaccine production as well as facilities that fill and package vaccine vials, White House COVID adviser Jeffrey Zients said during a news conference. ""The investments we are making, the $3 billion, are in U.S. companies that will expand their capacity for critical supplies,"" Zients said. He added that areas of focus will include lipids, bioreactor bags, tubing, needles, syringes, and personal protective equipment. The White House has not yet selected specific companies to receive the funds. U.S. demand for COVID-19 vaccines remains high as the White House prepares to begin offering a third booster shot to Americans later this month, pending a regulator greenlight. The United States also plans to give hundreds of millions of shots to other countries during the remainder of the year. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci added that he would not be surprised if a third dose became standard for COVID-19 vaccines that originally were expected to require two shots. U.S. cases of COVID-19 have surged to a seven-day average of more than 150,000 per day, up from less than 10,000 in June, according to federal data, as the contagious new Delta variant continues to circulate. The daily average of COVID-19 deaths has risen this week to more than 950 from around 900 last week, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said. Fauci downplayed concerns about a new COVID-19 variant known as Mu, or B.1.621, that some scientists are concerned could be resistant to vaccines. ""Even when you have variants that do diminish somewhat the efficacy of vaccines, the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that type,"" Fauci said.

Plea hearing scheduled for 'QAnon Shaman' facing Jan. 6 riot charges,1839,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The federal judge hearing the case of the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot defendant known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" has scheduled a plea hearing for Friday, according to a court filing and the defendant's lawyer. In a news release, Albert Watkins, lawyer for the ""Shaman,"" confirmed that a hearing had been set for Friday morning ""for the horn donning, fur wearing, tattoo chested, Jacob Chansley,"" which is the defendant's real name. Court records show that Chansley faces six charges, including civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding. As of Thursday, records do not indicate which specific charge or charges to which Chansley intends to plead guilty. He had been a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory that casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals. In his news release, Watkins asserted that Chansley, whom he previously acknowledged had been found by prison officials to be suffering from mental disorders, now ""has repudiated the ‘Q’ previously assigned to him and requests future references to him be devoid of use of the letter ‘Q’.” Watkins said that in the months since the riot Chansley, who has been held in pretrial detention, had charted a difficult path involving ""pain, depression, solitary confinement, introspection, recognition of mental health vulnerabilities, and a coming to grips with the need for more self-work."" Chansley is one of the most recognizable of the hundreds of Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 after the then-president in a fiery speech falsely claimed that his November election defeat was the result of fraud.

"U.S. House to vote on abortion bill, faces tough path in Senate",2974,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives plans to debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping states from enacting tough anti-abortion regulations like the one in Texas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday, but the bill's prospects in the Senate were slim. Declaring that the Texas statute ""delivers catastrophe to women in Texas, particularly women of color and women from low-income communities,"" Pelosi said in a statement that a Democratic bill would be brought before the full House after Sept. 20, when its recess is scheduled to end. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters President Joe Biden will consult with lawmakers on legislation to protect women's right to abortions. She said a range of approaches were under review, including the bill to be voted upon by the House. It was unclear whether the Senate would bring up such a bill even if it is passed by the House, however. It would face a difficult path in the 100-member chamber, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris having the power to break tie votes. Most legislation requires the support of at least 60 lawmakers to advance in the Senate. The House Democrats' measure, the Women's Health Protection Act, would likely struggle to get 10 votes among Republicans. Most Republicans oppose abortion, one of the most divisive issues in the United States, and many have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark decision making it a woman's constitutional right. The Women's Health Protection Act has been introduced in Congress multiple times since 2013 but never advanced in either the House or Senate. The issue took on renewed urgency for Democrats after a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling late on Wednesday allowing a Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion to remain in force. read more The bill aims to protect health care providers’ ability to deliver abortion services free from restrictions such as waiting periods, admitting privilege requirements for providers, or what supporters argue are unnecessary medical procedures, like ultrasounds, before an abortion can be performed. The Texas law and the Supreme Court's initial reaction to it could motivate Democratic voters to turn out in elections in November 2022, which Republicans are hoping will allow them to take control of the House and Senate. With such a tenuous hold on the two chambers, a number of Democrats want to change the 60-vote ""filibuster"" rule in the Senate so that bills could advance now with a simple majority of 51 lawmakers. ""Democrats can either abolish the filibuster and expand the court, or do nothing as millions of peoples’ bodies, rights, and lives are sacrificed for far-right minority rule,"" liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

Transgender insureds can sue over health plan exclusion - 4th Circ,2243,"(Reuters) - Transgender people who are enrolled in the North Carolina State Health Plan can proceed with a lawsuit over its 2018 decision to exclude all coverage for gender dysphoria counseling, hormone therapy, surgical care or other treatment, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Wednesday. The 2-1 decision affirmed a federal judge in Greensboro’s 2020 ruling that NCSHP lacks sovereign immunity from the suit, which was filed by Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund, the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, and Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis on behalf of seven state workers or their dependents under the antidiscrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act. NCSHP waived its 11th Amendment protections against the discrimination lawsuit by accepting federal funds, Chief Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the majority. He quoted from the Civil Rights Remedies Equalization Act (CRREA), which provides that states have no sovereign immunity from suits alleging a violation of “the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.” Circuit Judge Albert Diaz concurred in the result, specifying that he did so based on the combined effect of CRREA and the Affordable Care Act rather than the ACA’s antidiscrimination section alone. The dissenter, Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee, said a state’s waiver of sovereign immunity must be knowing and voluntary, and CRREA – which predates the Affordable Care Act, and never mentions it – fails to provide the requisite notice. “The NCSHP’s sovereign immunity from suit should have been confirmed and the case dismissed,” Agee concluded. “The Supreme Court should proceed expeditiously to correct the constitutional error here.” The case is Maxwell Kadel et al. v.

Hundreds of those workers staged a five-hour work stoppage on Thursday and took to the streets in Athens and other Greek cities for a second time in less than a month to protest against the new rule. A labour union official for hospital workers POEDIN said that a total of 10,000 unvaccinated staff could be suspended, disrupting operations at understaffed Greek hospitals at a time when infections remained high and were likely to rise further. ""We have worked so hard during the pandemic and this is what we get,"" said protester Anna Haritou, who worked as a midwife at an Athens hospital until she was suspended on Wednesday. Attempting to ease any fallout, the government on Thursday said legislation would be amended to allow workers be removed from suspension and get back to their jobs immediately as long as they got the first dose in the coming days. A key condition is that they conclude their vaccination. ""Mandatory vaccination for the workers of the NHS (National Health System) was legislated to help safeguarding public health,"" health minister Thanos Plevris said on Thursday. ""Since we do not intend to punish (people), we will introduce an amendment."" About 53 percent of the Greek population is fully vaccinated and authorities hope to bring that figure up to 70 percent by the autumn. Greece on Thursday reported 2,840 new coronavirus daily cases and 33 deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Italy may eventually make COVID vaccine shots compulsory for all, Draghi says",2180,"ROME, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Italy may eventually make COVID-19 inoculations compulsory for everyone of eligible age, and plans to start administering booster vaccine shots later this month to vulnerable people, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Thursday. The government has already made it mandatory for medical workers to get vaccinated if they want to be paid, but Draghi said everyone may be obliged to get a shot when EU health authorities give full approval to the vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given conditional approval to four vaccines. This could be upgraded to so-called standard marketing authorisation after further checks, at which point, Draghi said, they could become compulsory for all. Such a move would likely spark fierce opposition in a country that has seen a rise in scepticism about all kinds of vaccines over the past decade and where health experts who have promoted inoculations have faced verbal abuse and threats from No Vax opponents. Draghi denounced these attacks, telling a news conference that ""such violence is particularly odious and cowardly when it is directed against those ... in the front line of the fight against the pandemic"". The prime minister told reporters he was confident that 80% of all Italians aged 12 and over would be fully vaccinated by the end of the month, against 70.5% at present. He added that his government was planning to further extend the usage of so-called Green Pass health documents, which are currently needed for long-distance travel, access to many leisure activities and are also obligatory for school workers. read more Officials said last week they were considering extending the scheme to anyone working in a public office or a supermarket. The system has triggered protests by some Italians who say it tramples on freedoms. Some 129,352 people have died of coronavirus in Italy since the pandemic hit last year, the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain. New cases held relatively steady in August, but doctors fear the more contagious Delta variant could cause a fresh spike in infections in the coming weeks. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. labor market powers ahead as weekly jobless claims fall, layoffs hit 24-year low",5799,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market was charging ahead even as new COVID-19 infections surge. The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls tumbling to a 17-month low in the third week of August. Declining layoffs should help to ease concerns about the economy even if August's closely watched employment report on Friday shows a slowdown in nonfarm payrolls growth. ""Regardless of tomorrow's report, keep in mind that the weekly jobless figures say the labor market screws continue to tighten,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There is no sign that the Delta variant is leading to job losses across the country."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 for the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of coronavirus cases. There were notable declines in applications in California, Illinois and Virginia, while Ohio and Missouri reported big increases. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 345,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. The latest wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, and an acute shortage of workers have left some economists expecting moderate job gains in August. Labor market indicators last month were mixed, with a measure of factory employment contracting and private payrolls undershooting expectations. But hiring by small businesses accelerated and consumers' views of the labor market remained fairly upbeat. read more Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index (.SPX) touching a record high. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. WORKER SHORTAGES While last week's claims data has no bearing on August's employment report as it falls outside the survey period, applications trended lower last month. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 160,000 to 2.748 million in the week ended Aug. 21, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs last month after rising by 943,000 in July. ""We expect the jobs report to show that the economy continued to add jobs at a rapid pace in August, defying COVID-19 Delta variant outbreaks across the country,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. That optimism was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers decreased 17% to 15,723 in August, the lowest number since June 1997. So far this year, employers have announced 247,326 job cuts, down 87% compared to the same period last year. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. But soaring COVID-19 cases could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. The claims report showed about 12.2 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-August. This number is expected to drop sharply after next Monday's expiration of government programs, which will affect about 7.5 million people. About 25 states led by Republican governors terminated the expanded benefits several months ago. Those steps did not lead to an increase in hiring, leaving some economists to caution against expectations for an increase in the labor pool. ""Many states already have ended the programs ahead of the federal expiration but so far we have yet to see clear changes associated with the ends of these programs in many of the different variables we have studied,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The labor market recovery is gaining steam despite a slowdown in economic activity caused by the latest coronavirus wave, fading fiscal stimulus and supply constraints. As a result of the expiration of the expanded benefits, weekly unemployment checks for nearly 3.0 million people will be reduced by $300, which economists say will hurt consumer spending. But the moderation in growth is likely to be mitigated by a shrinking trade deficit. The trade gap narrowed 4.3% to $70.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday. Economists have sharply marked down their gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter to a low as a 2.9% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter. ""The slowdown is not broad-based and primarily reflects payback from stimulus spending and ongoing supply issues,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

Philippines' Duterte says medical supplies not overpriced,1692,"MANILA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday denied allegations that medical supplies like personal protective equipment and face masks were overpriced, lashing out at lawmakers probing government officials over emergency purchases last year. The firebrand leader remains popular in the Philippines, but his administration is facing growing criticism over its handling of one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia. ""At the height of the pandemic, when it began, we had nothing,"" Duterte said in a weekly late-night national address. ""It was costly because of lack of supply."" Opposition lawmakers questioned the government's emergency deals to buy medical supplies from a lowly-capitalised company with links to government officials. In budget hearings, health ministry officials were grilled on unspent pandemic funds. State auditors have flagged ""deficiencies"" in more than $1 billion in COVID-19 funds. ""Senate, do not investigate programmes which are ongoing. You will derail it by your incessant penchant for investigating government offices,"" Duterte said. With 2 million confirmed infections and 33,680 deaths, the Philippines has the second highest number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia. Surging cases driven by the Delta variant are overwhelming hospitals, while healthcare workers have protested to end to what they called government neglect and unpaid benefits. Duterte, who is banned by the constitution from seeking re-election, plans to run as vice president next year. Critics see it as an effort to extend his power.

S.Africa's Aspen seeks licence for J&J COVID shot as EU shipments halted,3255,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Aspen Pharmacare (APNJ.J) said on Thursday it was in talks to make Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) coronavirus shot under licence in South Africa, at what would be the continent's first major independent distribution base for a global vaccine against COVID-19. News of the talks coincided with the suspension of heavily criticised shipments to Europe from Africa of the same shot, which is already being made under contract and packaged by Aspen but distributed by J&J. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last month he was ""stunned"" by that arrangement, since Europe has very high inoculation rates while less than 3% of Africa's adults have been vaccinated. read more Aspen CEO Stephen Saad told Reuters it was now seeking a far bigger deal with J&J that would allow it to make, market and sell the vaccine under licence for the whole of Africa, along the lines of the model used by India's Serum Institute. ""At the moment we contract manufacture for J&J. So that's what we do. We take it, they release it,"" Saad said in an interview. ""...But a licence would be different. We would then sell to the end-customer. And then we have a brand. And then we also have control over where our product goes"" and over pricing. ""...At the moment, J&J could take all the product we make because it's their product, and sell it ...wherever they choose to. We have no say in that."" J&J said in a statement that it was talking to Aspen ""to evaluate the further expansion of capacity at Aspen's vaccine manufacturing facility to enable increased COVID-19 vaccine production, including a possible license for Africa"". RAMAPHOSA INTERVENTIONS In an online briefing, African Union (AU) coronavirus envoy Strive Masiyiwa said the arrangement whereby J&J was sending shots finished in Africa to Europe was halted following interventions by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The fewer than 20 million doses shipped so far would be returned. ""All the vaccines produced at Aspen will stay in Africa and will be distributed to Africa,"" Masiyiwa said. Africa aims to vaccinate 60% of its adult population by 2022. But by August, just 10% of the doses that the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, co-run by the WHO, had forecast it would ship there by that time had been delivered, according to the AU. read more Masiyiwa said the talks between J&J and Aspen also came as a result of the South African president requesting that the arrangement between them be changed. Aspen is looking to expand annual vaccine production capacity from around 300 million doses to about 450 million by February 2022. Saad said it was too early to say whether some of that would be reserved for production under licence, though from October onwards, all of the J&J vaccine doses being packaged at its plant would go to African countries. J&J has contracts to supply 31 million doses of vaccine to South Africa and at least 220 million to the rest of Africa. The new arrangement would be ""like (India's) Serum where they get the licenses to manufacture. It's not a foreign model,"" Saad said of the licensing talks.

Number of people with dementia set to jump 40% to 78 mln by 2030 -WHO,2283,"GENEVA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - More than 55 million people worldwide are living with dementia, a neurological disorder that robs them of their memory and costs the world $1.3 trillion a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday. The progressive condition can be caused by stroke, brain injury or Alzheimer's disease. With populations ageing, the number of sufferers is projected to rise to 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050, the WHO said in a report. Only one in four countries has a national policy in place to support dementia patients and their families, it said, urging governments to step up to the public health challenge. ""Dementia robs millions of people of their memories, independence and dignity, but it also robs the rest of us of the people we know and love,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. ""The world is failing people with dementia, and that hurts all of us,"" he said. Health ministers agreed in 2015 on a global action plan, including early diagnosis and providing care, but are falling short on meeting targets by 2025, it said. ""Dementia truly is a global public health concern and not just in high-income countries. In fact, over 60% of people with dementia live in low- and middle-income countries,"" Katrin Seeher, an expert in WHO's department of mental health, told a news briefing. Medication, hygiene products and household adjustments for dementia patients are more accessible in wealthy countries, which have a greater level of reimbursement than in lower-income countries, the report said. Dementia affects memory, orientation, learning capacity, language, judgement, and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Seeher noted that dementia can also affect people aged below 65, with so-called young-onset dementia accounting for around 10% of all dementia cases. But developing dementia is not inevitable and some risk factors can be reduced, by controlling hypertension, diabetes, diet, depression, and the use of alcohol and tobacco, the WHO said. ""These are the things that we can do to promote our brain health and decrease the cognitive decline and the risk for dementia. These are things that can be started at a younger age,"" said WHO expert Tarun Dua. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Get vaccinated, French pupils told as they go back to school",2367,"PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Twelve million French children, who returned to school from their summer break on Thursday, wearing masks, were told by head teachers and President Emmanuel Macron that they should get vaccinated against COVID-19. Only about 47% of 12-to-17-year-olds are fully vaccinated, a concern for the spread of the coronavirus in general - and for how long classes can remain open. ""You need to keep getting vaccinated, and you need, even if I know it's a bit unpleasant, to continue wearing a mask in the classroom, wash your hands and keep your distance,"" Macron told French kids in a video posted on social media.

German firms seek details of employees' vaccine status,2613,"BERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The German government is looking into whether it could temporarily ease data privacy rules to allow companies to find out whether their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19, ministers said on Wednesday. Many countries are making vaccination mandatory for healthcare staff and public sector workers and some companies - particularly in the United States - have started demanding that employees are inoculated. But Germany has tough laws regulating data privacy because of its history of Nazi and Communist state surveillance of citizens, meaning that companies have no right to find out about health issues relating to their staff. German businesses have been pushing to be able to ask staff about vaccination and the government is trying to get more people to get the shots as infections rise again. Almost 61% of the population has had both shots and 65% at least one. The cabinet agreed on Wednesday that companies must allow their employees time off to get vaccinated and said companies deciding on protective measures could take into account the vaccination status of their staff, if they knew it. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the government was looking into the question of whether companies could be allowed to ask about vaccination, particularly for jobs he described as vulnerable. He said there were difficult discussions within the coalition government on the issue, particularly between Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, from the Social Democrats (SPD), and Health Minister Jens Spahn from the Christian Democrats. Heil told ARD television he knew that many employees were also interested in knowing the vaccination status of their colleagues, but the law means that employers cannot ask for it. ""Health data of employees is particularly sensitive,"" Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht, also from the SPD, told the Funke media group, but added that granting employers the right to that information might be possible in risky workplaces. Heil said pragmatic solutions were needed, for example in hospitals or prisons. Exemptions to privacy laws have already been made to allow restaurants to reopen, with staff and customers required to show that they are vaccinated, cured or test negative. Several thousand people marched through the streets of Berlin on Saturday and Sunday in unauthorised protests against coronavirus vaccinations and restrictions. The country reported 13,531 new cases on Wednesday and 23 fatalities, bringing the total number of cases to more than 3.9 million and the death toll to 92,223.

Vietnam PM warns of long coronavirus fight as crisis deepens,2010,"HANOI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Vietnam could be facing a lengthy battle against the coronavirus and cannot rely on lockdown and quarantine measures indefinitely, its prime minister said, as the country struggles to contain its deadliest outbreak so far. Vietnam has deployed soldiers and forced residents of its biggest city to stay in their homes in recent weeks, in its most drastic measures yet to fight an outbreak that has shattered what was one of the world's best containment records. ""We cannot resort to quarantine and lockdown measures forever, as it will cause difficulty for the people and the economy,"" Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said late Wednesday. Aggressive contact tracing and quarantine procedures in the country of 98 million people had succeeded in keeping the virus under control for over a year, but the highly contagious Delta variant has hit Vietnam hard. Total cases jumped from just a few thousand in late April to 480,000 at present, with more than 12,000 deaths, with Ho Chi Minh City by far the worst hit. Authorities reported 13,197 infections and 271 fatalities on Thursday. Restrictions were causing ""material and mental hardship,"" Chinh said while meeting experts to hear ideas on fighting the virus. The measures have also forced companies in labour-intensive businesses, including suppliers for brands like Nike (NKE.N) and Adidas (ADSGn.DE), to suspend operations. Vietnam's industrial output in August fell 7.4% from a year earlier, while its exports dropped 5.4%. Retail sales of goods and services plunged 33.7%, according to official figures. Chinh said preventing deaths was top priority and vaccinations were a key strategic measure. Just 2.9% of Vietnam's population have been inoculated, while its fatality rate of 2.5% is higher than the global rate of 2.1%, according to the health ministry. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving in a complicated and unpredictable manner and may last for a long time,"" Chinh said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

South African train brings COVID-19 vaccines closer to people,2454,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - At Springs train station in South Africa's biggest city Johannesburg, Simphiwe Dyantyi and her partner wait their turn to board. But they are not going anywhere, instead they are getting COVID-19 jabs inside a stationary train. The initiative by South African state logistics firm Transnet is meant to bring vaccines closer to people and save them from travelling long distances as the government ramps up its COVID-19 vaccination drive. From the Springs station, the Transvaco train will in the first week of September move to rural Eastern Cape province. Once there, it will make stops in different places in the province, bringing relief to poor villagers who are often without basic health facilities. It will be stationed there until November. Dyantyi, 32, said the train had saved her a trip to the next vaccination centre where queues have been long since the government made vaccinations available to all adults last month.

South Africa has been battered by three coronavirus waves, infecting at least 2,770,575 million people, killing 81,830 - by far the continent's worst toll - and pummelling an already struggling economy with lockdowns and travel restrictions. South Africa has vaccinated more than 12 million people after its campaign got off to a slow start due to bureaucratic hiccups and a failure to start early talks with pharmaceutical companies, among other challenges. ""We are basically bringing the vaccines to the people,"" Paballo Mokoena, the train manager said.

"Kosovo to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines",1916,"PRISTINA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Kosovo government decided to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccines over their expired date of use as the country faces a sharp rise in the coronavirus death rate. The vaccines that will be destroyed were part of a donation from Norway with August 31 seen as an expiration date. The decision to destroy vaccines triggered criticism, with some people calling for the resignation of the health minister on the health ministry's Facebook page. Unwillingness to take vaccines, technical difficulties when attempting to make an appointment online and propaganda about harm from the vaccines had put Kosovo among the countries with the lowest vaccination rates in Europe at 15.7%. In the past seven days 157 people died in Kosovo of coronavirus infectionS, and more than 12,0000 new cases were registered among the country's 1.8 million population. New cases were attributed to gatherings such as weddings and a complete scrapping of restrictions. Starting from this week new restrictions are in place including a curfew from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m.. Thousands of Kosovars living abroad, mainly in Germany and Switzerland, who have spent holidays in Kosovo during the summer have reported as positive cases when they returned to western European countries. Kosovo’s Health Minister Arben Vitia said many people refused to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine following “misinformation” that the vaccines already have expired which made people stay away. In Kosovo people can choose between AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BionTech vaccines. But because of some reports on AstraZeneca vaccines, people mostly have chosen Pfizer/BionTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE). Vitia said that in the coming days Kosovo will receive 500,000 Pfizer/BionTech vaccines from the United States, and 250,000 AstraZeneca vaccines from Germany and Italy as donations.

Thai royalist turns protester as anti-government movement broadens,3850,"BANGKOK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Often seen at the wheel of one of his supercars, Thai ultra-royalist Tanat ""Nat"" Thanakitamnuay became a well-known face at demonstrations that ushered in Thailand's 2014 coup. Now he is back on the streets demanding the removal of coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister and reforms to the monarchy - a change of heart that points to the broadening of Thailand's latest anti-government movement. ""It's bad for your mental health to see an incompetent PM,"" said Nat, 29, who was blinded permanently in his right eye last month after being hit by a teargas canister at a protest. He switched sides in part because of anger over the government's widely-criticised handling of the latest coronavirus outbreak, which has brought severe economic hardship as well as nearly 12,000 deaths. That has given new life to a student-led protest movement that emerged last year with demands to limit the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy and remove Prayuth, a former army chief who seized power in 2014 after months of protests against the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra. After a lull due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings, demonstrations against Prayuth have gathered renewed steam in recent weeks. ""The protests have broadened due to COVID-19 and its economic consequences,"" Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of Ubon Ratchathani University's political science faculty, told Reuters. ""That prompted a more diverse group of people to join."" Defending the government's handling of the pandemic, Anucha Burapachaisri, deputy secretary to the prime minister, told Reuters that all necessary measures to contain the spread of infections had been taken. But a recent poll said fewer than 30% of people thought they could rely on the government of Prayuth, who rejects the accusations of opponents that he manipulated a 2019 election to keep power he had taken by force.

His appearance at protests is very different to that of the youth activists as he drives in his Range Rover along with a bodyguard and a secretary. ""It shocked us initially, but we thought that him joining us was very useful because it paved the way for others,"" student activist Songpon ""Yajai"" Sonthirak told Reuters. ""It shows how people can reform themselves and how we are inclusive."" Nat said his time as a politician with the pro-establishment Democrat Party had made him suspicious of all those proclaiming loyalty to the monarchy. He has joined calls for the removal of the lese majeste law outlawing criticism of the king, which can mean 15 years in jail and has been used against most of the youth protest leaders. After losing his eye, Nat sports a black eyepatch marked with three white dashes representing the ""Hunger Games"" salute adopted by pro-democracy campaigners. ""We have to do whatever we can, whatever it takes,"" he told Reuters. ""If it will cost me another eye then so be it."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Analysis: Texas abortion ban opens up 'Wild West' of enforcement, critics say",4742,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Texas's strict new abortion ban hands over the power of enforcement to private citizens - and offers them cash payments to do so - a unique construction that makes the law harder to block in court. That structure has alarmed both abortion providers, who said they feel like they now have prices on their heads, and legal experts who said citizen enforcement could have broad repercussions if it was used across the United States to address other contentious social issues. ""It is a little bit like the Wild West,"" said Harold Krent, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. He called it a throwback to early U.S. history when it was common to have privately enforced laws at a time when the government was limited and there was little organized law enforcement. The law, known as S.B. 8, bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. That is often before women realize they are pregnant and could effectively ban 85% to 90% of abortions, abortion rights campaigners said. Krent said the measure could be ripe for abuse because anyone can sue for any reason, without government officials exercising the kind of discretion they normally would over enforcing a law, Krent added. This feature creates all kinds of problems for abortion providers seeking to challenge the law, which went into effect on Wednesday. The Supreme Court late on Wednesday denied an application brought by a coalition that supports abortion rights seeking to put the law on hold. L1N2Q4097 Texas is the only one of 12 six-week abortion bans that has gone into effect. Others were routinely blocked by lower courts as a violation of Supreme Court precedent - including the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - guaranteeing the right to an abortion, especially at an early stage of pregnancy. The challenges facing abortion providers in Texas are two-fold. 'VIGILANTE' SYSTEM First, the law sets up what critics have called a ""vigilante"" system in which any Texas resident can sue an abortion provider or anyone who aids and abets someone seeking to obtain an abortion. If they win, they could get a bounty of at least $10,000, which would come out of the pockets of the defendants. The mere threat of litigation has prompted abortion clinics in Texas to immediately limit their abortion services in compliance with the law. There are other laws that have provisions that allow private citizens to enforce them, including various environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, as well as statutes that encourage whistleblowers to report fraud and abuse within the government. But these laws do not give people the power to sue to prevent someone else exercising a right recognized by the Supreme Court. The way the law has written also makes it difficult for abortion rights campaigners to challenge it. In the current litigation, lawyers for the state have countered that the abortion rights campaigners' ""own litigation decisions, not some injustice foisted upon them"" are to blame for their failure to block the measure. They say, for example, that the challengers waited too long to file their lawsuit. Legal experts say that abortion providers could likely succeed in winning lawsuits on an individual basis but face barriers in blocking it statewide, In the current case, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals canceled a lower court hearing to consider whether the law should be put on hold in part because of the complex legal questions raised. One risky way abortion providers could seek to challenge the law is to continue to provide abortions after six weeks, thereby inviting a lawsuit, said Vikram Amar, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. Then, they could argue that the law is unconstitutional and ""hope that a state court decides to follow existing Supreme Court precedent and declare the state law invalid,"" he added. If the law remains in place, abortion providers expect other states to enact similar measures. It could also prompt states to consider similarly structured laws aimed at people exercising rights that state officials - whether they be Republicans or Democrats - frown upon. ""You can spin out hypothetical after hypothetical about any individual right that a state could undermine,"" said Marc Hearron, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights who represents the challengers. ""That's why I think everyone from all sides ... ought to be extremely concerned."" As for those providing abortions, Dr. Anuj Khattar, a doctor from Washington state who flies to Texas to provide abortions, believes the law will have a chilling effect. ""I feel like there's a bounty on my head and I don’t want play this game,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

CMC warns on profits as trading volumes ease after frenzy,1888,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Online broker CMC (CMCX.L) cut its annual profit guidance by up to 80 million pounds ($110 million) on Thursday after market volatility eased from extreme levels earlier in the pandemic, triggering a 27% fall in its share price. CMC, which lets investors trade complex financial instruments on its platforms, said overall market activity had been subdued over the last couple of months, leading to lower trading volumes across new and existing clients. The company's stock dived 27% to its lowest in more than a year on the London Stock Exchange by 1000 GMT, heading for its worst day since late 2016. ""CMC cannot escape the slowdown in trading activity,"" Peel Hunt analysts wrote in a note. Among reasons for the drop, it cited clients taking holidays after the easing of pandemic curbs, meaning they have less money to spend on investing as well as less time. CMC and the broader sector profited from high volumes as fears over the economic impact of the health crisis spurred volatility, while a so-called ""GameStonk"" retail trading frenzy on Wall Street during the lockdowns also aided.

Facemasks and sanitizer as French kids go back to school,1260,"PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Twelve million French children headed back to school on Thursday, wearing facemasks, using sanitizer at the entrance and standing distanced from each other in the yard under strict government rules aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. ""This is very different from usual 'back-to-school' days,"" said Matthieu Seguin, deputy director of the Rodin high school in central Paris, also pointing out air purifiers in classrooms and spare masks for any pupils that had forgotten theirs. With inoculations now also available for children from age 12, and pupils encouraged to get their shots, Seguin said his school might become a vaccination center. Eleven-year-old Louise admitted being a bit nervous for her first day at a big school but said she couldn't wait to get her shot. ""I really want to get vaccinated,"" she said. For others, the focus was different: ""I'm really happy because I will discover high school and be back with my buddies,"" 11-year-old Eli said.

Stars return to Venice red carpet as film festival opens,3263,"VENICE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Decked out in a black and white Chanel gown, Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz led the comeback of movie stars to the red carpet of the Venice film festival on its opening night on Wednesday, as cinema hopes to shake off the gloom of the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike rival Cannes, the world's oldest film festival did not skip the 2020 edition due to the health crisis but it is only this year that celebrities are returning in force to the Lido waterfront, in a show of support for an industry hammered by lockdowns. Organisers are banking on a strict anti-COVID protocol to help keep the 11-day movie marathon trouble free. Theatres are operating at half capacity and a wall blocks the view to the red carpet to stop crowds from gathering outside the main venue. Face masks and a health pass or a negative COVID test are required to attend screenings, and there will be fewer late-night parties. ""They are taking measures really seriously. Everyone is being really careful, really responsible. I think it's great for the industry that things can start to come back,"" Cruz told Reuters ahead of the opening ceremony. ""I am happy that it's happening. It's a celebration of cinema but it also gives jobs to a lot of people around the world."" Cruz stars in ""Parallel Mothers"", the festival's opening film by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Hollywood stars Kirsten Dunst, Timothee Chalamet, Matt Dillon and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also among those who have made the trip to Venice so far. Actor Serena Rossi, who will host the opening ceremony of the 78th Venice International Film Festival, poses during a photocall on the beach, in Venice, Italy, August 31, 2021. REUTERS/Yara Nardi ""Everybody everywhere is eager to come back, to reopen, to restart, to release the films that stayed on the shelf for a year and a half or maybe two years,"" festival director Alberto Barbera told Reuters. He said most of the world premieres to be screened at the festival were already sold out, and promised that there would be no shortage of celebrities - even though fans will not be able to get anywhere near them. ""The red carpet will be one of the most crowded in years because everybody is here,"" he said. Titles vying for the Golden Lion award for best film include Jane Campion's ""The Power of the Dog"", with Benedict Cumberbatch as a ranch owner who torments a young widow played by Dunst, and Kristen Stewart's turn as Princess Diana in ""Spencer"". Also in the main line-up is Gyllenhaal with her debut as director, of ""The Lost Daughter"", based on an Elena Ferrante novel and starring Olivia Colman and Dakota Johnson. Ridley Scott's medieval epic ""The Last Duel"" starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and Denis Villeneuve's hotly anticipated science-fiction tale ""Dune"", with Chalamet and Zendaya, will both screen out of competition. The festival is a showcase for Oscar contenders as awards season approaches, and South Korean ""Parasite"" director Bong Joon-ho - who presides over the jury - said he was ready for a fight with fellow jury members to pick the award winners. ""As a film-maker I don't believe cinema can be stopped so easily. COVID will pass, cinema will continue,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"U.S. FDA seeks new warnings on arthritis drugs from Pfizer, Lilly and AbbVie",1992,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator has asked Pfizer (PFE.N), Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) and AbbVie (ABBV.N) to include information about the risks of serious conditions and death from the use of their drugs that belong to a class of treatments known as JAK inhibitors. The warnings on Wednesday stem from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's review of Pfizer's arthritis drug Xeljanz after initial results from a February trial showed an increased risk of serious heart-related problems and cancer with the drug. AbbVie shares closed down 7%, while Pfizer and Eli Lilly were slightly lower. Pfizer said the update would bring important clarity for healthcare providers on the risk/benefit profile of Xeljanz. JAK inhibitors like Xeljanz block inflammation-causing enzymes, known as Janus kinases, and target autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. The FDA said Lilly's drug Olumiant and AbbVie's Rinvoq have similar operating mechanisms, leading to the possibility of risks seen in the Xeljanz safety trial. ""Based on available data across approved and investigational indications, we remain confident in the positive benefit-risk profile of Olumiant,"" Lilly said. AbbVie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FDA is currently reviewing AbbVie's applications for expanded use of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Rinvoq in patients with active psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis. ""We wait to see how the FDA handles the ongoing regulatory review of Rinvoq and other JAKs in atopic dermatitis and other indications, but believe investors are now pricing in a worst-case scenario for Rinvoq,"" Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said, referring to the decline in AbbVie shares. Incyte Corp's (INCY.O) Jakafi and Bristol Myers Squibb's (BMY.N) JAK inhibitor Inrebic will not need warnings as they are not approved to treat inflammatory conditions, the agency said.

Azarenka calls for mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations,2492,"NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka moved into the U.S. Open third round with a 6-3 7-6 (1) win over Italy's Jasmine Paolini on Wednesday, saying she was happy to be back playing in front of crowds at Flushing Meadows, especially vaccinated fans. Azarenka made it to the final last year before losing to Naomi Osaka but did it in empty stadiums as COVID-19 restrictions barred spectators from the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. This year the fans are back but only those who have proof of vaccination and the 18th-seeded Belarusian admitted confusion over why the rules do not extend to players as well. ""It was great to be back playing in front of fans and mostly vaccinated,"" said the twice Australian Open champion, who pulled out of a WTA Tour event in April because it coincided with her scheduled COVID-19 vaccination. ""To me that's a bit bizarre that fans have to be vaccinated and players are not. ""So I think that in my opinion, it's inevitable that it will be mandated at some point, like other leagues are doing. ""I don't see the point of stalling it, because I think we all want to be safe, we all want to continue doing our jobs."" The New York City mayor's office last week mandated proof of vaccine to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the major puts on its prime time matches. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) then elected to extend the vaccine requirement to all attendees aged 12 or older entering the sprawling facility. Both the WTA and ATP has urged players to get vaccinated but some have expressed reservations and declared the decision a freedom of choice. World number three Stefanos Tsitsipas said he would only get the COVID-19 vaccine if it became mandatory to compete in tennis, drawing a sharp rebuke from the Greek government. World number one Novak Djokovic, who is bidding to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam at the U.S. Open, said in April he hoped the COVID-19 vaccine would not become mandatory for players and has declined to answer questions regarding his own vaccination status. ""I respect everybody's opinion as long as it's not conspiracy theory,"" said Azarenka, a three-times U.S. Open runner-up. ""If you actually have decent knowledge and looked into research and have your facts and stats and research, that's a different conversation.

Bulgaria imposes new restrictions to curb surge in COVID cases,1499,"SOFIA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Restaurants and bars in Bulgaria will have to close at 10 p.m. from Sept. 7, while indoor sports competitions will be held without spectators, the health minister said on Thursday, as the Balkan country braces for a surge of new coronavirus infections. Bulgaria, the least vaccinated country against the coronavirus in the European Union, has seen a spike in infections in recent weeks, mostly of the highly infectious Delta variant. On Thursday alone the country of 7 million people registered some 1,745 new cases, bringing its tally of active infections to some 32,192. Some 18,950 people have died since the beginning of the pandemic, with 54 more deaths reported on Thursday in the country with the highest mortality rate in the European Union, figures from Our World in Data showed. ""There is no place for panic. The situation is serious, but not out of control. The low percentage of vaccinations forces us to impose these measures,"" interim Health Minister Stoicho Katsarov told reporters. He appealed again for Bulgarians to get vaccinated. Under the new restrictions, which will be in force until the end of October, music festivals will be banned, while cinemas and theatres will have to operate at 50% capacity. Students will be allowed to attend classes when the school year begins on Sept. 15, Katsarov said, but he warned that if the infections continue to rise, they may have to switch to online studies.

Thailand cites positive results from Sinovac-AstraZeneca vaccine formula,2024,"BANGKOK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Thailand's health ministry said on Thursday that its COVID-19 vaccine regimen of China's Sinovac (SVA.O) followed by British-developed AstraZeneca (AZN.L) was safe and successfully boosted immunity among its first 1.5 million recipients. Thailand in July became the first country in the world to mix a Chinese vaccine and a Western-developed vaccine as cases and deaths in the country surged and the government struggled with vaccine supplies. ""The cross formula has been injected to over 1.5 million people and it is safe. Please don't say things that would create concern,"" senior health official Supakit Sirilak told a news conference. He said Thailand, which has been manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine, would no longer be giving two doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac. Just 13% of Thailand's population of over 66 million has been fully vaccinated. The majority of its 1.2 million infections and 12,103 coronavirus deaths came after April this year, brought on by the highly transmissible Alpha and Delta variants. The health ministry said the Sinovac-AstraZeneca combination boosted immunity to the same levels as two AstraZeneca shots and meant vaccinations could be completed faster due to the shorter dose gap. The formula will be used for most of Thailand's vaccinations, Public Health Permanent Secretary Kiatiphum Wongrajit said. Booster doses will be given to 3 million people who received two Sinovac shots, using a different type of vaccine, likely from this month, health minister Anutin Charnvirakul has said. Sinovac's inactivated virus vaccine has caused concern in some countries about its resistance to the Delta variant. Earlier this week during a censure debate on the coronavirus crisis, Anutin told lawmakers not to criticise Sinovac, to protect the Thai public and avoid harming ties with China.

Japanese PM's rival Kishida urges coronavirus stimulus package,3964,"TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Japan's former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who is challenging Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as ruling party chief, said on Thursday an economic stimulus package worth ""tens of trillions of yen"" was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Kishida also said Japan must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the pandemic-hit economy, offering the clearest sign to date that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies would remain in place if he replaced Suga. The winner of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race is all but assured to become premier given the party's majority in parliament's powerful lower chamber. ""Many countries are signalling that they will maintain expansionary fiscal and monetary policy steps for the time being. Japan must not fall behind,"" he told a news conference, shifting away from his prior remarks signalling the need to dial back the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose policy. Kishida also said that as party chief, he would aim to bring socio-economic activities back to near normalcy by early 2022, criticising the current handling of the pandemic as too little and too slow. Kishida said the stimulus package must be compiled ""swiftly"" and include cash payments to non-permanent workers and others who will be affected by steps to contain the flow of people. The party leader contest is slated for Sept. 29, and the government is considering a plan to hold the general election on Oct. 17. 'WORST-CASE SCENARIO' Late on Wednesday, Japan's minister for digital transformation became the first serving cabinet member to openly back Kishida. The move marked another turn in the rollercoaster week that saw the unpopular Suga come to the brink of calling a snap election on Tuesday night, only to deny the reports by Wednesday morning after party grandees, including his powerful predecessor Shinzo Abe, intervened to stop him. In a series of manoeuvres to cling on to his job, Suga is set to remove his unpopular long-term ally Toshihiro Nikai from a key LDP post. It is a part of a reshuffle expected next week that will likely bring several high-profile names to both party executive positions and Suga's cabinet as the premier strives to shore up his support. Kishida said Suga's coronavirus policies were fragmented and piecemeal and said the government should move with urgency. ""In crisis management, being more thorough in assuming the worst-case scenario, rather than believing enough has been done, is necessary,"" he said. Kishida laid out plans to set up a new government agency overseeing health crisis management, complete vaccinations by November, and to provide government aid for the development of oral drugs for COVID-19 treatment. ""I would have legislation revised so state and local governments have strong authority to curb people's movement and secure medical resources,"" Kishida said. When launching his candidacy last week, he said he wanted to reduce income gaps and support the economically vulnerable such as workers in insecure jobs and women, in contrast with Suga, who has stressed self-reliance before public support. ""Suga has been focused on helping businesses, such as aids for corporate loans. Kishida, by contrast, emphasises support for household income rather than companies,"" said Daiju Aoki, chief Japan economist at UBS SuMi TRUST Wealth Management. ""While both are calling for expansionary fiscal policies, this point is clearly different."" The low-key Kishida, 64, has ranked poorly in surveys of voters' preferred next premier, but the head of an LDP faction is now viewed as a promising rallying point for lawmakers seeking a new leader ahead of the lower house election. Suga, 72, took office last September with support of about 70% but his ratings have sunk to record lows below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections and many of his LDP lawmakers fear for their seats.

Densely populated Kerala, on India's southern tip, accounted for nearly 70% of the 47,092 new infections and a third of deaths, a week after it celebrated its biggest festival during which family and social gatherings were common. ""With cases rising in Kerala, adequate steps should be taken to contain the inter-state spread of COVID-19,"" Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in a statement after speaking with his state counterparts in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which border Kerala. He asked them to increase vaccination in the districts close to Kerala. India has so far administered 662 million doses, with at least one dose in 54% of its 944 million adults and the required two doses in 16%. Vaccinations have soared in recent days as supplies have improved. And as more than two-thirds of Indians already have COVID-fighting antibodies, mainly through natural infection, experts think another national surge in cases will be less deadly than the last one in April and May when tens of thousands of people died and hospitals ran out of beds and oxygen. Also offering hope is a recent non-peer-reviewed study done in Kerala that showed that one dose of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shot, the mainstay of India's immunisation drive, generates 30 times more antibodies in previously infected people than fully inoculated ones who never contracted the virus. ""A decently managed vaccination programme, along with the hybrid immunity we're seeing now, makes a massive third wave unlikely,"" said clinical immunologist and rheumatologist Padmanabha Shenoy, who led the study and was referring to the immunity from natural infection and one vaccine dose. The federal government, nevertheless, has warned that like in Kerala, the rest of India could also see a rise in infections around the festival season starting this month and ending in early November. Some parents are also worried about the reopening of physical classes - voluntary and mainly for middle school and above - in the capital Delhi and states like Gujarat. India has so far reported about 32.9 million infections, the most in the world after the United States. Deaths went up by 509 on Thursday to a total of 439,529, which experts say is a massive undercount. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand says fall in COVID-19 cases shows Delta lockdown working,1808,"WELLINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported a drop in new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, which authorities said was a sign that a nationwide lockdown was helping to limit spread of the infectious Delta variant. Barring a few cases in February, New Zealand had been largely free of coronavirus until the Delta outbreak prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order the snap lockdown last month. Authorities reported 49 new infections in the outbreak epicentre of Auckland, a fall from 75 on Wednesday, taking the tally to 736. ""The latest lower number is encouraging and does show that our alert level 4 lockdown is working, even against Delta,"" the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told a news conference. Of the 42 people in hospital infected with Delta, six were in intensive care units (ICU) and three on ventilation, he added. About 2 million people in the largest city of Auckland and the neighbouring Northland region remain in strict level 4 lockdown, but authorities have eased curbs elsewhere. ""Our case numbers are moving around ... that's not unusual,"" Ardern told the news conference. ""The important thing is we are seeing some positive trends."" Northland will drop to alert level 3 from midnight, Ardern said, bringing it in line with the rest of the country. Ardern's lockdowns and international border closure since March 2020 have been credited with reining in COVID-19, largely freeing up day-to-day activities from curbs. But the government faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population of 5.1 million has been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Australian doctors warn of risks to hospitals once COVID-19 curbs ease,2982,"SYDNEY, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Australian doctors on Thursday warned the country's hospitals are not ready to cope with the government's reopening plans, even with higher vaccination rates, as some states prepare to move from a virus suppression strategy to living with COVID-19. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) said the health system was in danger of being locked into a ""permanent cycle of crisis"" and has called for new modelling to check if staffing levels in hospitals can withstand an expected surge in cases when lockdown rules ease. ""If you have opened up and you haven't looked at the safety nets or the life rafts that we've got, we might end up actually trying to push more people on the life rafts and capsizing them,"" AMA Vice President Chris Moy told broadcaster ABC. Australia in July unveiled a four-stage plan back to greater freedoms when the country reaches 70%-80% vaccination. read more But virus-free Queensland and Western Australia have said they may not stick to those plans as the agreement was finalised when cases in New South Wales were much lower. New South Wales on Thursday reported 1,288 new locally acquired cases, just below its pandemic high of 1,290 hit on Monday. Seven new deaths were recorded. A total of 957 people are in hospitals, up from 698 a week ago, while cases in intensive care units (ICU) jumped nearly 40% to 160, 64 of whom require ventilation. Authorities quadrupled the number of the state's intensive care ventilators to 2,000 early last year, but the medical association's Moy said governments need to focus on hospital staffing before relaxing lockdown rules. ""It's not just the number of ventilators, it's not the number of IC units, it's the number of staff and people that are going to have to man this when we open up,"" he said. 'DON'T DELAY INEVITABLE' Soaring cases forced Victoria on Wednesday to join New South Wales in abandoning a COVID-zero target, with both states now targetting rapid vaccinations as a pathway to freedom after failing to quell an outbreak of the Delta variant, even after a weeks-long lockdown. read more New cases in Victoria jumped to 176 on Thursday, the year's biggest daily rise, from 120 a day earlier. Australia has largely lived in COVID-zero for much of the pandemic, recording 1,019 deaths in total and just over 56,500 cases. But a slow vaccination rollout has left it vulnerable to more infections and hospitalisations. So far, only about 36% of people above 16 have been fully vaccinated, well below most comparable countries. The federal government urged all states to stick to the national reopening plan, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg saying the states can't ""delay the inevitable."" ""You have to learn to live with COVID-19. COVID-19 may come to your state within a week, it might be a month, it might be a little bit after that. But the reality is we can't eliminate the virus,"" Frydenberg told Nine News on Thursday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Helped by TSMC and Foxconn, BioNTech vaccines finally reach Taiwan",2929,"TAOYUAN, Taiwan, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The first batch of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, helped by the involvement of two of the world's most important tech firms after months of heated political and diplomatic wrangling. Taiwan has blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an original order from the German firm this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government then allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high-profile billionaire founder, Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the doses. A $350 million deal for 10 million shots was inked in July, which will be donated to the government for distribution. A cargo flight from Luxembourg carrying the vaccines landed at Taiwan's main international airport at Taoyuan, outside of Taipei, at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT), and was met on the tarmac by Health Minister Chen Shih-chung and Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation's chairwoman and Gou's cousin. Chen spoke briefly to thank the companies, and a Taiwanese Buddhist group that has also ordered 5 million doses, for their efforts to get the vaccine. ""They've worked very hard and overcome all the difficulties,"" he said. Chen did not mention Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (600196.SS), which has the right to sell the shots on BioNTech's behalf in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and whose unit signed the deal for the island's doses. A large label on the side of one of the crates with the names of BioNTech, Fosun and the vaccine, using simplified Chinese characters, which are not used in Taiwan, was removed before arrival. Fosun had posted a picture on its Weibo account of the crate in the warehouse, with the label, before it was loaded onto the aircraft. In another flourish of drama, China announced the exact arrival date of the vaccines on Wednesday, shortly before Chen began his daily news briefing. The roughly 900,000 doses of the vaccine, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), are expected to start being administered later this month. Taiwan is getting the shots earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order. More than 10 million vaccine doses have arrived in Taiwan to date, split between Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), while local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp's (6547.TWO) shots have also started to be administered.

South Korean health workers drop strike plans after agreement,1777,"SEOUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Korean frontline health workers on Thursday dropped plans to strike after they reached an agreement with the government on their demand for increased staffing and better work conditions during last-ditch negotiations overnight.

Natasha Harrison steps down from Boies Schiller's leadership role,3190,"(Reuters) - Boies Schiller Flexner said on Wednesday that Natasha Harrison, a London-based lawyer who was seen to be next in line to take the reins from the firm's chair, famed trial lawyer David Boies, has stepped down from her role as deputy chair of the litigation firm. Harrison had been tapped as co-managing partner and one of Boies' likely successors in 2019, along with former partner Nicholas Gravante. She was elevated to the deputy chair post last December after Gravante decamped for Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. In a firmwide email obtained by Reuters, the firm's managing partners, and founders Boies and Jonathan Schiller, said ""a variety of professional and very personal factors"" that are largely tied to challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to Harrison's decision. ""International travel restrictions have prevented Natasha from spending the kind of time in the U.S., actively engaging with the leadership team, the Firm and our U.S.-based clients, that she feels is necessary to fulfill the obligations of the Deputy Chair position,"" the email said. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Boies said the firm has not appointed a successor for Harrison and will discuss whether there is a need for the deputy chair role. Harrison will remain one of the firm's four managing partners, serving alongside Sigrid McCawley, Matthew Schwartz, and Alan Vickery, and will continue to serve on its executive committee. ""We have a transparent, effective team of managing partners,"" Harrison said in the interview with Reuters on Wednesday. ""I expect the other managing partners will become more involved in other aspects of the business I've been leading on. I think from a firm perspective, things will be quite seamless."" The firm was founded in 1997, the same year Boies was hired by the U.S. government in antitrust litigation against Microsoft Corp, boosting the firm's reputation as a litigation powerhouse. He later represented Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court battle over the 2000 presidential election recount. The firm had for years been among the most profitable U.S. law firms, with partners commonly earning seven-figure compensation, according to data from The American Lawyer. But, it has lost dozens of partners since the start of 2020. Departing lawyers cited concerns over transparency, culture and the health of the firm, among other factors, as their reasons for leaving. Harrison has said in previous interviews that some of the departures were planned and part of a restructuring and leadership change. Last year, the firm's revenue dropped 38% to $250 million while profits per equity partner dropped by 32% to nearly $2.3 million, according The American Lawyer. Looking ahead, Boies said he is expecting better financial results for this year. ""Our revenue was down significantly last year in part because of the pandemic and in part because the number of lawyers that we had reduced,"" Boies said. ""But I think this year we will be well over the million dollars of revenue per lawyer benchmark."" Xiumei Dong reports on the business of law. She is based in Washington, DC.

Pfizer's Hospira escapes adrenaline patent claims based on PTO omissions,3614,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Pfizer unit's win against Belcher Pharmaceuticals' claims that its adrenaline shot Abboject infringed a Belcher adrenaline patent was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Wednesday. Belcher's patent was invalid because the company purposely omitted important information from its application that would have kept the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from awarding the patent if it had had the information, U.S. Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. Belcher's chief science officer Darren Rubin represented to the PTO that its formulation was a novel invention that was contrary to prior art and solved problems that ""seemed impossible,"" while also telling the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about earlier formulations with similar specifications, Reyna said. Belcher and its attorney Peter Lancaster of Dorsey & Whitney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Pfizer subsidiary Hospira's attorney Matthew Freimuth of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Largo, Florida-based Belcher applied for FDA approval of an injectible formulation of adrenaline in 2012, and applied for a patent related to the drug in 2014, which was issued in 2016. The drug has several potential uses, including countering allergic reactions, treating cardiac arrest, and providing relief for asthma and COPD. Belcher sued Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira in 2017, alleging its application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Abboject infringed Belcher's patent. After a two-day bench trial, U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Delaware ruled last year that the patent was invalid based on inequitable conduct, finding Rubin withheld three pieces of information that would have prevented the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from awarding the patent. Belcher argued on appeal that, among other things, the prior art was immaterial, and that Rubin withheld it because he genuinely believed it was irrelevant based on other features of the prior art that differed from Belcher's drug. Reyna, joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Richard Taranto and Kara Stoll, wrote on Wednesday that the information Rubin withheld was material to the decision to issue the patent and that he intended to mislead the PTO. The prior art disclosed epinephrine formulations with the same pH range as Belcher's drug that would have made the patent obvious, Reyna said. He also noted that the Delaware court found the relevant parts of the patent invalid based on one of the pieces of prior art, an earlier epinephrine product from another company. Reyna also said that the ""single most reasonable inference"" was that Rubin intended to deceive the PTO. He noted Rubin's ""about-face"" from telling the FDA that the drug's claimed pH range was ""old"" to telling the PTO that it was a ""critical innovation"" that yielded ""unexpected results,"" and rejected Belcher's ""post hoc rationale"" for withholding the information. The case is Belcher Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Hospira Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 20-1799.

2nd Circ. denies challenges to ban on deadly paint remover,3961,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday denied an industry bid to partly invalidate an Environmental Protection Agency rule banning the deadly methylene chloride chemical in paint removers for consumers, and rejected a separate environmentalists' petition seeking to expand the prohibition. A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Inc's (HSIA) claims that the rule restricts, arbitrarily, not only sales to individuals but also some commercial sales by barring small businesses from distributing the product. The panel also turned down a consolidated petition by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and its co-plaintiffs, who sought to broaden the ban to commercial users, who can still buy the product in bulk, by alleging the EPA was violating its regulatory obligations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). HSIA and its lawyers at Squire Patton Boggs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Robert Sussman, a lawyer for co-plaintiff Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, said: ""It's deeply disappointing that the Court declined to require EPA to ban commercial paint remover uses of methylene chloride after the Agency has delayed action for years despite dozens of deaths."" EPA spokesperson Ken Labbe said: ""Because this is pending litigation, EPA has no additional information to share."" The EPA prohibited the manufacturing, import, processing and distribution of methylene chloride in paint strippers for consumer use in 2019, but not for use in industrial settings. Exposure to methylene chloride fumes can rapidly cause dizziness, loss of consciousness and death, the agency has said. HSIA sued shortly after the 2019 ban, as did the green coalition. HSIA asked the court to vacate provisions of the rule prohibiting retailers from selling the product, arguing it was ""inconsistent"" to allow its commercial use while prohibiting contractors and artisans also commercial users, from buying the product from retailers. The NRDC and its co-plaintiffs for their part claimed that the EPA had violated TSCA obligations to eliminate a chemical with unreasonable risks. Responding to HSIA's claims, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval wrote that the 2019 rule had deferred regulating access to methylene chloride, rather than crafted a policy favoring continued access. The EPA determined, the following year, that commercial use of the chemical presents an unreasonable risk to health, the ruling said. That determination evidenced the absence of a policy favoring continued access to the product with which the retail ban would be ""inconsistent,"" Leval wrote. And given that the 2020 determination had triggered a deadline under the TSCA to finalize a rule on the substance's commercial use within two years, the judge held that the green groups' claims were ""prudentially unripe."" Leval was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Jose Cabranes and Reena Raggi. The case is Labor Council for Latin American Advancement v.

Canada's ruling Liberals pledge massive new investments as election looms,3201,"OTTAWA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party on Wednesday pledged a whopping C$78 billion ($62 billion) in new investments over five years, with a focus on healthcare, if it wins the Sept. 20 federal election. The investments would be partially offset by more than C$25 billion in new revenue, mostly from a higher tax on profits of banks and insurers and fighting tax evasion, the party said in releasing its full election platform. These investments are in addition to the C$101 billion in extra spending over three years passed in a budget earlier this year, and would be spread over five years, from 2021-22 to 2025-26. The Liberals spent heavily on programs to shield citizens and businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the national debt and budget deficits to record highs. Trudeau sidestepped repeated questions as to when the budget might be balanced. ""I think it matters to be fiscally responsible. I think it matters to live within our means,"" he told a news conference in Toronto. ""I think it also matters to be making the right investments so that future generations can prosper."" ""This is a plan for jobs and growth,"" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said standing alongside Trudeau. Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is projected to decline 2 percentage points to 46.5% in 2025-26, the Liberals said. Trudeau called a snap vote two years early on Aug 15 hoping his management of the pandemic and his vaccine roll out would be a springboard to a majority. (See party platform FACTBOX: ) But the polls show Trudeau's Liberals in a statistical tie with Erin O'Toole's Conservatives less than three weeks before the vote. (POLLS: ) The platform is ""more borrowing, more debt, higher taxes, and rising prices,"" said Dan Robertson, chief of strategy for O'Toole, on Twitter. O'Toole has also put forward a big-spending platform, but he said on Tuesday he would balance the budget in 10 years time ""without cuts"" and only by boosting revenues through stronger economic growth. The Conservatives have yet to detail the costs of their platform. ""If he doesn't show the numbers, why should Canadians believe him?"" Trudeau said of O'Toole's pledge to balance the budget. ""He's relying on a level of magical thinking that involves 3% growth every single year."" Most of the individual policies in the Liberal platform have been announced, but this is the first glimpse at a full pricing of the plan with investments focused on improving long-term care, mental health, indigenous health and lowering soaring housing costs. One new element in the platform is a promise by Liberals to increase accessibility for abortions across the country while revoking the charity status of anti-abortion organizations, an issue that has historically divided Canadian Conservatives. While legal in Canada, access to abortions varies by province. Trudeau has suggested that a woman's right to choose could be threatened if the Conservatives win, given that some social conservatives want abortion limits to be imposed. O'Toole reiterated on Wednesday that he is pro-choice. ($1 = 1.2587 Canadian dollars) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge will approve Purdue Pharma bankruptcy plan that shields Sacklers,5202,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Wednesday he would approve OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan, clearing a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shielding the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future opioid litigation. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said that with small changes he would approve the plan, which overcame opposition to garner support from nearly all states, local governments, tribes, hospitals and other creditors that voted on the restructuring. They became creditors in the bankruptcy by virtue of suing Purdue and Sackler family members over their alleged contributions to the nationwide opioid epidemic. Drain said it was clear the wrongful marketing of the company's opioid products contributed to the addiction crisis, which touched every corner of the country. ""That makes the bankruptcy case before me highly unusual and complex,"" said Drain, who spent more than six hours reading his ruling from the bench. The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, dissolves the drugmaker and shifts assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company will be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic. It also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks introduced legislation to block such legal releases. The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid addiction crisis. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. The Purdue bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members. The contribution is in the form of cash that will be paid over roughly a decade and also includes $175 million in value from relinquishing control of charitable institutions. Drain noted that he had expected a larger contribution from the Sacklers and said the evidence showed more might have been secured through litigation, although that was hard to predict. ""This is a bitter result,"" he said. He also said he would not jeopardize what the plan achieved by rejecting it and asked for small changes to secure his final approval. Still, the evidence showed the plan was negotiated by the creditors who all viewed the Sacklers as ""the other side, the opposition, the potential defendants,"" Drain said. ""This is not the Sacklers' plan."" 'INSULTING TO VICTIMS' The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct. Several state attorneys general opposed the plan. “This order is insulting to victims of the opioid epidemic who had no voice in these proceedings,” said Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who said his office would appeal. A lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog and part of the Department of Justice, said his office would file a motion for a stay of the order confirming the plan during the appeal. More than 95% of creditors voting approved Purdue's restructuring, far above the legal threshold required for a bankruptcy judge's blessing. Ryan Hampton resigned on Tuesday as the co-chair of the official creditors committee, which included governments and other creditors. Even though the committee helped negotiate the plan, he called the outcome a ""total injustice."" He said people like himself who were recovering from addiction were the real victims and they had to fight states and local governments during plan negotiations for the $750 million set aside for them. ""At no point were the victims listened to,"" he said. Sackler family members behind Purdue were prolific philanthropists, with their names on museum wings and other cultural institutions. They have also agreed to a prohibition on associating their name with charitable contributions until litigation settlement funds are fully paid, according to court records. Much of the plan's value is contingent on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications that Purdue has under development. Drain noted that Sackler family owners who testified showed little remorse. ""A forced apology is not really an apology,"" he said. ""And so we will live without one."" Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits against the company and Sackler family for contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999. Drain, the judge overseeing the case in a White Plains, New York, bankruptcy court, agreed early in the case to halt litigation against Purdue and Sackler family members, who had not filed for bankruptcy themselves. Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They previously agreed to pay $225 million to resolve separate civil allegations with the Justice Department. The family members have denied those allegations. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge throws out suit against Tesaro board over $5.1 bln sale,3058,"(Reuters) - A Delaware judge threw out a shareholder’s suit accusing Tesaro Inc’s managers and lead venture capital investor of selling the cancer drug company to GlaxoSmithKline Plc in an allegedly conflicted $5.1 billion sale. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn in Wilmington said on Tuesday that she was dismissing former Tesaro investor John Kihm’s suit because she was “satisfied,” that when Tesaro’s shareholders approved the deal, they were fully informed and not coerced by major investor and venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates Inc. “In the complaint, the private equity sponsor is everywhere and nowhere: the plaintiff offers pages of allegations about the sponsor’s motivations, but does not assert the sponsor was a controlling stockholder, nor that the sponsor or any of its agents had any specific role in the flawed sale process,” Zurn wrote in granting the defendants' motions to dismiss. Kihm’s attorneys, including Randall Baron of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Neither did attorneys for the Tesaro officers and directors, NEA and Citigroup. Representatives for GlaxoSmithKline, NEA and Citigroup also did not respond to requests for comment. GlaxoSmithKline announced in December 2018 that it had agreed to purchase Waltham, Massachusetts-based Tesaro for $75 a share at a premium. The deal closed in January 2019. Kihm filed a proposed class action in November 2020, alleging that NEA and its employees who sat on Tesaro’s board pushed for the acquisition to financially benefit the venture capital firm. The Tesaro investor also accused CitiGroup of being conflicted because it was acting as Tesaro’s financial advisor while advising GlaxoSmithKline on another transaction. The defendants denied wrongdoing and moved to dismiss the lawsuit. In her ruling, Zurn said the Tesaro investor didn’t show that documents recommending the transaction to shareholders lacked important information. The judge said that certain projections didn’t need to be included because they wouldn’t have changed the overall information available to shareholders. She also said the documents adequately informed Tesaro's investors about Citigroup’s conflicts of interest as well as conflicts of interest between one of Tesaro’s directors and NEA. The case is Kihm v. Mott, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 2020-0938.

Texas's near-total abortion ban takes effect after Supreme Court inaction,5913,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Texas on Wednesday enacted the strictest anti-abortion law in the country after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to act on a request by abortion-rights groups to block the law banning the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy. It was a victory for conservatives, who have long sought to eliminate abortion access in the United States. Prominent Democrats including President Joe Biden voiced outrage, saying the Texas law violated the right to abortion access established by the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973. ""My administration ... will protect and defend that right,"" Biden said. Abortion rights activists said such a ban has not been enacted in any U.S. state since that landmark ruling. Texas abortion providers worked until almost the midnight deadline, when the 6-3 conservative-majority court's inaction allowed the law to be enforced while abortion-rights groups further pursue their legal challenge to its constitutionality. The justices could yet take action on the Texas case. But they have already agreed to hear arguments in Mississippi's effort to overturn Roe v. Wade. The law amounts to a near-total ban on abortion procedures given that 85% to 90% of abortions occur after six weeks of pregnancy, and would likely force many clinics to close, the abortion-rights groups said. A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. But it remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and a majority of Republicans opposing them. Texas's Republican-controlled state legislature this week also passed a bill restricting voter access, following Republican former President Donald Trump's election defeat, which he falsely blamed on widespread voter fraud. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to sign that bill into law. 'BOUNTY SYSTEM' Abortion opponents nationwide are hopeful the Supreme Court, which now has three Trump-appointed justices, will eventually take steps to reverse Roe v. Wade. At Whole Woman's Health in Fort Worth, Texas, clinic staff worked up to midnight, serving 25 patients in the 2-1/2 hours before the deadline. The national group said its Texas locations, also including Austin and McKinney, remained open on Wednesday. ""This morning I woke up feeling a deep sadness,"" said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization's chief executive. ""This law opens up a bounty system, a vigilante kind of system that can call into question anyone who supports access to abortion."" A demonstrator holds up an abortion flag outside of the U.S. Supreme Court as justices hear a major abortion case on the legality of a Republican-backed Louisiana law that imposes restrictions on abortion doctors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 4, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo Whole Woman's Health, Planned Parenthood and other women's health providers, doctors and some clergy members challenged the law in federal court in Austin in July, contending it violated the constitutional right to an abortion. The law, signed on May 19, is unusual in that it prevents government officials from enforcing the ban, instead giving private citizens that power by enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. Citizens who win such lawsuits would be entitled to at least $10,000. Abortion providers say the law could lead to hundreds of costly lawsuits that would be logistically difficult to defend. In a legal filing, Texas officials told the Supreme Court justices to reject the abortion providers' request, doubting it can be challenged before it has been enforced against them. Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states that have enacted ""heartbeat"" abortion bans, which outlaw the procedure once the rhythmic contracting of fetal cardiac tissue can be detected, often at six weeks - sometimes before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Courts have blocked such bans. ""Texas Right to Life is thankful that the Texas Heartbeat Act is now in effect. We are now the first state ever to enforce a heartbeat law. We still await word from SCOTUS,"" spokeswoman Kimberlyn Schwartz said in a statement, using an acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States. A court could still put the ban on hold, and no court has yet ruled on its constitutionality, Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, wrote in a tweet. ""Despite what some will say, this isn't the 'end' of Roe,"" he wrote. 'BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER STATES' In the Texas case, empowering private citizens helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the government. It is a formula other states seeking heartbeat bans could potentially follow, legal experts said. ""Texas has certainly created a blueprint for other states,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion at Florida State University College of Law. Those states may see that path as unnecessary, she said, given that the Supreme Court has already agreed to hear a major case over Mississippi's 2018 law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The justices will hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. The Texas challenge seeks to prevent judges, county clerks and other state entities from enforcing the law. A federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss the case, prompting an immediate appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which halted further proceedings. On Sunday, the 5th Circuit denied a request by the abortion providers to block the law pending the appeal. The providers then asked the Supreme Court for an emergency ruling.

EU health body says no urgent need for vaccine boosters,1383,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said on Wednesday there was no urgent need for booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the fully vaccinated, citing data on the effectiveness of shots. The comments follow a similar statement from the European Medicines Agency last month that more data was needed on the duration of protection after full inoculation to recommend using booster shots. read more The evidence on real-world effectiveness shows that all vaccines authorized in the region are highly protective against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe disease and death, the ECDC said. But the agency said extra doses can be considered for people who experience a limited response to the standard regimen, adding that these shots should be treated differently from booster doses. Germany and France have announced they would begin giving boosters to vulnerable people and the immunocompromised from this month to protect citizens from the more infectious Delta variant. read more The U.S. government has also started administering a third dose of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)-BioNTech and Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) vaccines to those with compromised immunity. read more It plans to offer booster doses more widely from Sept. 20 if the country's health regulators deem them necessary. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Antibody levels higher after Moderna shot; Lilly arthritis drug used with steroid cuts death risk,3729,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Antibody levels are higher after Moderna vaccine The mRNA vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) induces higher levels of antibodies against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 than the similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech SE , Belgian researchers have found, although what this means for their efficacy is not clear. Soon after receiving their second shot, the 688 healthcare workers who got Moderna's vaccine had antibody levels roughly twice as high as the 959 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech product, regardless of their ages, doctors at a Belgian medical center reported. This held true even after accounting for individual risk factors, and regardless of whether participants had previously been infected with the virus, the researchers reported on Monday in JAMA. Antibodies are just one component of the immune system's defenses, however. The study cannot determine whether one vaccine is more effective at preventing infection or illness, or whether the antibodies induced stay longer in the blood before disappearing. Those questions, and others, require further investigation, the researchers said. Arthritis drug adds to benefit of steroids in severe illness Hospitalized COVID-19 patients died less often if they received Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib along with the other treatments their doctors had prescribed, according to a study published on Wednesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The randomized trial involved 1,525 seriously ill patients, all of whom needed extra oxygen to help with breathing. More than 90% were already receiving dexamethasone, a cheap generic steroid known to improve survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients. While baricitinib, sold under the brand name Olumiant, did not appear to keep patients from getting sicker, it did reduce their risk of dying. The 28-day and 60-day death rates were 5% lower among patients randomly assigned to receive baricitinib instead of a placebo. Baricitinib is already approved in the United States for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead Science's (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir. The two drugs together appear to have more benefit than remdesivir alone. In the new study, more than 80% of participants were not receiving remdesivir, suggesting that baricitinib also ""has synergistic effects with other standard-of-care treatments,"" including dexamethasone, researchers said. Vaccine poses low risk for adults with high-risk allergies Highly allergic adults can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, a new study suggests. Among the 8,102 patients with allergies in the Israeli study, 95% received the shots in routine settings because their risk of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine was low, and no such reactions were reported. The remaining 429 patients, who were considered to be highly allergic, received the vaccines under careful supervision and were observed for two hours afterward. Nine had allergic reactions, including three who showed signs of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. All responded to treatment with epinephrine and no one had to be hospitalized, according to a report published on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open. An editorial published with the study said lessons from this study of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine are likely ""generalizable to the Moderna"" shot as well.

Aviation insurers hold back on Afghanistan flights after U.S. troops leave,3239,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Aviation insurers are unwilling to insure commercial flights into Afghanistan because of the risk of attacks after U.S. troops left the country, making it hard to deliver aid or evacuate people, industry sources told Reuters. Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers took control of the airport in Kabul on Tuesday after a massive airlift of more than 123,000 people by the United States and its allies ended. read more Bruce Carman, chief underwriting officer at Hive Aero, said his firm had been able to offer insurance cover for evacuation flights last week, but ""no one can fly there right now"". Shortly before the final pullout of U.S. forces on Monday, an executive with an airline involved in the evacuation flights said it was already hard to find insurers willing to quote for Afghanistan. Lack of air traffic control services, rocket attacks and reports of hostilities around the airport make insuring flights to the Afghan capital exceptionally risky, sources said. Afghanistan's airspace was ""released to the military"" in mid-August and the aviation authority advised airlines to avoid its air corridors. U.S. civil aircraft are barred from operating over the country unless given prior authorization, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday. read more Premium rates to cover aircraft flying into Afghanistan against attacks - known as hull war insurance - rose fivefold last week, with insurers putting in strict requirements, such as two-hour turnarounds at Kabul airport, a broker said. Airlines typically buy hull war cover if they are flying into conflict areas, but the chaotic mass evacuation and withdrawal of foreign troops meant the risks for Afghanistan were particularly acute. ""There was a massive unknown as to how the Taliban would react to the evacuation, and couple this with the added threat of ISIS-K specifically targeting the airport, the stakes were very high,"" said Hive's Carman. ""Premiums charged were a reflection of the level of danger."" Islamic State affiliate ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside the airport on Thursday that killed 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians. The World Health Organization's regional emergency director Rick Brennan said last week that insurance premiums had ""skyrocketed at prices we have never seen before"". read more But a plane carrying WHO medicines and health supplies did land in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Monday, in the final hours of the U.S. withdrawal - the first shipment to get in since the Taliban took control on Aug. 15. read more The flight had insurance, a WHO spokesperson said, adding: ""Our air cargo partners continue to negotiate for the best rates with insurers, which are fluctuating.""

Migrant arrivals to Spain's Canary Islands double from last year,1540,"GRAN CANARIA, Spain, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spain's sea rescue service on Wednesday rescued around 100 migrants trying to reach the Canary Islands in rickety boats from north or west Africa amid a surge in arrivals that have more than doubled so far this year from 2020 levels. The migrants were rescued off three boats and all appeared to be in good health, a sea rescue service spokesperson said. On Tuesday the service rescued 31 migrants on a boat off the island of Lanzarote, with one of them dying shortly after. The migrants told emergency services the boat had left African shores with around 60 people on board and that some had fallen into the sea during the journey, the spokesperson said. A total of 8,222 migrants arrived in the Canaries illegally between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15, compared to 3,364 in the same period of last year, according to Interior Ministry data. Over 23,000 migrants arrived in the archipelago in 2020, which marked an eight-fold increase from 2019 and was one of the busiest years for such crossings in the past decade, overwhelming authorities and sparking tensions on the islands. Overall arrivals in Spain grew by 29% in 2020, reaching close to 42,000 people. Earlier this year, authorities opened several camps for migrants in the Canaries. They were devised as a more stable solution after the 2020 influx, when hundreds of people stayed for weeks at a crammed, hastily improvised dockside camp, where conditions were harshly criticised by rights groups.

Meet the St. Louis bankruptcy chief who aims for pragmatism,6821,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - After a decade on the bench, St. Louis's Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kathy Surratt-States was caught between a coal company that was trying to reduce pension benefits and retired miners who were aghast at the proposal. All eyes were on her as she tried to balance the reality of a company burdened with unsustainable debt and its obligations to its miners. In the end, she approved the company's plan, a difficult decision that she stands by. But it wasn’t easy. In deciding what to do about pension benefits in St. Louis-based Patriot Coal's first Chapter 11 case (it filed a second time a couple of years later, selling its assets to another coal producer) she read more than 900 letters from miners and their families, which often detailed the personal and financial hardships they endured. In a recent interview with Reuters, Surratt-States said she would note at every hearing how many letters she had received: “I thought it was important that those people had written to me, that I read those letters and that we acknowledged their part and opinions in the case.” Patriot Coal was one of the most high-profile cases Surratt-States, 54, had presided over since joining the bench in 2003. She made headlines in 2013 with her approval of the pension cuts, which had prompted staunch opposition from the United Mine Workers of America. Pension cuts for miners had become a hot topic as other large coal producers trickled into bankruptcy. AN EARLY START Unlike many lawyers and judges who turn to bankruptcy later in their careers, Surratt-States got her first taste of the practice area early, taking a job in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri after her first year of law school. She took on what she calls the “rather unglamorous job” of reorganizing the law clerks’ library. Despite the somewhat unexciting nature of the role, she enjoyed the work. Bankruptcy judges would sometimes tell her about interesting cases they were overseeing, which led her to slip into the back of their courtrooms and witness the action first hand. Surratt-States would eventually become the first Black bankruptcy judge in the judicial districts that comprise the 8th U.S. Circuit. She said she was excited to introduce some diversity to an area where ""there weren't a lot of women and certainly not a lot of people of color."" At the time, she was only the eighth Black bankruptcy judge in the country, out of a total of about 350. There are now 17. While she believes the bankruptcy bar is headed in the right direction in terms of diversifying its makeup, there’s still a ways to go, she says. That will likely need to start with building up a pipeline that begins with summer associates at law firms, she added. FAMILY MATTERS Surratt-States grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is a graduate of Booker T. Washington High School. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father an aircraft mechanic at American Airlines (which itself filed for bankruptcy in 2011.) Her parents stressed the importance of education, and she ultimately became the first lawyer in her family. She graduated from Oklahoma City University in 1988 with a degree in political science and earned her law degree from Washington University School of Law in 1991. Surratt-States, who is married to a St. Louis police department lieutenant, spent two years clerking at the St. Louis bankruptcy court after she graduated from law school. She later practiced bankruptcy and commercial litigation at Campbell & Coyne, followed by Ziercher and Hocker. Following her 2003 appointment to the bench, she became the chief judge in 2012. Her daughter is now a sophomore in college studying film production. Surratt-States is proud of the fact that when a group of her daughter’s classmates recently watched Ferris Bueller’s Day Off – one of the judge’s favorite movies – her daughter was one of the few who had seen the film. (The Blues Brothers is the judge’s other favorite.) “She told the rest of them, ‘Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. It's a great movie,'” Surratt-States said. MAKING THE HARD CALLS Since most of the cases on the St. Louis docket are consumer bankruptcies, Surratt-States spends a lot of her time confronting family troubles. The judge says as challenging as Patriot Coal was, the individual debtors often present the toughest situations for her. Consumer cases are especially hard if they involve domestic support obligations or children, she said. “Those are always difficult – to look at what happened with people who may have been in family court versus what's going on their lives now that one of the parties is in bankruptcy,” she said. Sometimes that means dealing with a debtor that's trying to hold on to a house or keep a family afloat when money has become tight, thanks to the pandemic, she said. The good news, she said, is that she's noticed Chapter 13 trustees have been more lenient with individual debtors during the COVID-19 crisis, giving them more time to sort out their finances or get their hands on necessary tax documents. On the corporate side of the docket, the Patriot Coal decision posed a different kind of challenge. Approving the company’s request to modify its benefits for thousands of retirees and their families meant ceasing pension contributions and replacing existing health benefits with a voluntary employees’ beneficiary association. The issue was especially sensitive as the company’s executives had recently been approved for bonuses. The United Mine Workers of America threatened to strike. Surratt-States issued her decision after a five-day trial. In the ruling, she posited that the situation may have been the result of ""unwarranted optimism"" by executives, but that for unions, there is ""likely some responsibility to be absorbed for demanding benefits that the employer cannot realistically fund in perpetuity."" The bottom line, she said, was the practicality of the situation. Patriot Coal, which was dealing with a $3 billion debt load at the time, simply could not afford to continue paying for health insurance at the level agreed to under the collective bargaining agreement. “Coal prices went down and expenses went up,” Surratt-States said. “So as a practical matter, are they going to have no insurance or some insurance going forward? That’s basically what it was going to come down to.” Read more: Bankrupt Patriot Coal can reject collective bargaining -court Maria Chutchian reports on corporate bankruptcies and restructurings.

11th Circuit sides with insurer in COVID coverage case,2156,"(Reuters) - In a second win for the insurer at the federal appellate level, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that Cincinnati Insurance Co’s business income interruption coverage did not include a Georgia dental practice’s losses from a state shelter-in-place order and federal guidance to postpone routine and elective medical procedures at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 11th Circuit agreed with Cincinnati’s attorneys at Litchfield Cavo and a March ruling by a federal judge in Atlanta, who dismissed Gilreath Dental Associates’ potential class action for failure to allege any property damage that would trigger coverage under the “all-risk” policy’s business income interruption, extra expense, or civil authority clauses. Gilreath was represented by Hall & Lampros. Circuit Judges Charles Wilson, Robin Rosenbaum, and Britt Grant issued the unpublished, per curiam opinion Tuesday without hearing argument. “Gilreath has alleged nothing that could qualify, to a layman or anyone else, as physical loss or damage” because the orders and guidance “did not damage or change the property in a way that required its repair or precluded its future use for dental procedures,” the opinion says. The 8th Circuit also ruled for Cincinnati Insurance in July in the first federal circuit court decision on BII coverage for losses arising from pandemic-related shutdown orders. In both circuits, Cincinnati drew amicus support from the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. According to the Covid Coverage Litigation Tracker at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, 183 federal appeals are pending, with 61 in the 9th Circuit alone. At least 57 cases are pending in state appellate courts, according to the tracker.

"Pfizer, Merck launch new trials of oral COVID-19 drugs",2569,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) announced on Wednesday new trials of their experimental oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19 as the race to develop an easy-to-administer treatment for the potentially fatal illness heats up. Pfizer said its latest mid-to-late-stage trial will enroll 1,140 non-hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus infection who are not at risk of severe illness. Patients in the trial will be given Pfizer's pill, known as PF-07321332, and a low dose of ritonavir, an older medication widely used in combination treatments for HIV infection. Pfizer's drug is designed to block the activity of a key enzyme that is needed for the coronavirus to multiply. Merck said its new trial will study experimental drug molnupiravir for the prevention of COVID-19 among adults in the same household as someone diagnosed with symptomatic coronavirus infection. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are already conducting a late-stage trial of the treatment in non-hospitalized patients to see if it reduces the risk of hospitalization or death. Molnupiravir is a type of antiviral designed to introduce errors into the RNA of the virus that eventually prevent it from replicating. Pfizer began in July a different trial of PF-07321332 in adults with COVID-19 infection who are at high risk of becoming severely ill due to underlying health conditions such as diabetes. The company said it expects initial results from that study some time this fall. Rivals Pfizer and Merck, along with Swiss pharmaceutical Roche Holding AG (ROG.S), have made the most progress in developing what would be the first antiviral pill to treat, or possibly prevent, COVID-19. To date, Gilead Sciences Inc's (GILD.O) intravenous drug Veklury, known generically as remdesivir, is the only approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 in the United States. Roche and partner Atea Pharmaceuticals (AVIR.O) in June said early data from a trial of their experimental oral antiviral AT-527 showed that it lowered viral load in hospitalized patients. Merck said in June that the U.S. government agreed to pay about $1.2 billion for 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir, if it is proven to work and authorized by regulators. The company said it expected to file for U.S. emergency use authorization of molnupiravir in the second half of 2021 at the earliest. Pfizer said in July if the PF-07321332 trial was successful, it would file for a potential emergency use authorization in the fourth quarter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Spain reaches goal of fully vaccinating 70% of its population,1515,"MADRID, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spain said on Wednesday 70% of its population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, fulfilling a goal set by the government for August, while the incidence rate kept the decreasing tendency of the past month after a big surge. With over 66 million doses administered, 70.3% of the Spanish population had received by Aug. 31 a complete vaccination programme while 77% had been partially vaccinated, Health Ministry data showed. ""We have achieved it thanks to the strength of the national public service, the effort by health professionals, the work from public agencies and the great awareness from citizens,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted. The average number of cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days in Spain decreased to 221 on Wednesday from 233 the prior day, according to the Health Ministry, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to over 4.8 million. But deaths registered in the past seven days grew, totalling 352 on Wednesday's report versus 319 on Tuesday, taking the overall number of fatalities caused by the virus to around 84,500. Health Minister Carolina Darias urged citizens to remain cautious to achieve a lower incidence. But in a sign of progress, central and regional authorities agreed to increase from 40% to a maximum of 60% the allowed occupancy in outdoor sports facilities, such as soccer stadiums, for the month of September, in a relief to clubs hard-hit by the pandemic's impact.

Most vaccinated Americans want COVID-19 booster shots -Reuters/Ipsos poll,3341,"WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As the United States gears up for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign, most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found, largely driven by concern over the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. The U.S. government said if health regulators approve the move, it will roll out COVID-19 booster shots starting Sept. 20 out of concern about waning vaccine protection against COVID-19 infections. Many scientists say the need for a booster has not been proven. The government has already made third shots available to immunocompromised adults. The national survey, conducted Aug. 27-30, found that among those adults who received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, 76% want a booster, while 6% do not and 18% were not sure. Among those aged 55 and over, 80% said they want one. ""I've got a four-year-old grandson. I want to make sure he knows me,"" said retired journalist Dora Ann Reaves, 75, from South Carolina. ""I'm going to take every opportunity to take every shot I can. I've already had everything else I can have, other than taking shots for bubonic plague."" The results reflect anxiety over the Delta variant that has caused a surge in infections and hospitalizations, and show the public favors boosters more than scientists do, said Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University. ""There's a lot of hedging among people in the medical community about the necessity of boosters, so it sounds like the general public is more in favor than a lot of practitioners are,"" he said. There is no harm in some people not wanting a booster because not everyone needs one, Gallagher said, adding that at-risk individuals should get them. The U.S. began offering the additional shot last month to people with compromised immune systems. Among those who want boosters, almost 43% said they were worried about the Delta variant and over 34% cited their age. Concern that their initial inoculation was no longer effective was cited by 28% of respondents, while 15% said they were immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk. ""I would like to get the booster to be on the safe side,"" said Texan customer service representative Joe Guerra, 63, who has rheumatoid arthritis, which could put him at higher risk. Many widely used medicines for the condition suppress the immune system. Guerra also expressed concern that millions of Americans remain unvaccinated. As of Aug. 31, over 66 million people - 25% of U.S. adults - have not received a single vaccine dose, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. ""It's not a smart thing to not get it. Just play by the rules, keep yourself safe, keep those around you safe,"" said high school graduate Jamarii Perrington, 18, in Massachusetts. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,427 adults, including 3,042 who had received at least once dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 2,374 who expressed interest in a booster shot. Ipsos weighted the results using the latest population and vaccination statistics so that they better reflected the U.S. population. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Moderna to recall COVID-19 doses in Japan after stainless steel contaminants found,3289,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T) on Wednesday said they are working with Japanese authorities to recall three batches of COVID-19 vaccine after an investigation found stainless steel contaminants in some vials. Japanese authorities had suspended use of these batches of Moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses last week after being notified of the contamination issue. Japan's health ministry said on Wednesday, based on information from the companies' investigation, that it did not believe the particles of stainless steel pose any additional health risk. Moderna said the stainless steel contamination probably occurred during production. read more Takeda distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan. The most probable cause of contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Moderna said in the joint statement with Takeda. The material was confirmed to be stainless steel. Moderna conducted its investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi (ROVI.MC), which operates the plant where the contamination occurred. ""Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk,"" Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement. Moderna shares were up 2.6% following the statement. Shares of Rovi were up than 4.5% after falling more than 10% on news of the dose suspensions. Takeda shares rose more than 2%. Administration of the Moderna shots from the three lots was suspended in Japan after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but shots from two other lots from the same Rovi manufacturing line were suspended as a precaution. Those three lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue, the statement said. Rovi has fully inspected its manufacturing facility and implemented new procedures to avoid similar problems in the future, it added. Use of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances were found in unused vials, while others appear to have been the result of incorrectly inserted needles causing bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off. read more The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots. read more The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated. Moderna and Takeda said in the joint statement that there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine. ""The relationship is currently considered to be coincidental,"" the companies said in the statement. About 500,000 people have received shots from the three suspended Moderna batches, Taro Kono, Japan's minister in charge of the vaccination campaign, told reporters on Friday. Moderna said it cannot confirm how many doses were distributed from the batches. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge denies class cert in 'sprawling' NFL opioid litigation,4165,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco has declined to certify a nationwide class in a lawsuit accusing the National Football League of failing to regulate teams' use of painkillers, saying a trial involving conduct that affected thousands of players over a 35-year period ""would become a sprawling train wreck."" U.S. District Judge William Alsup on Tuesday said variations in how the NFL's 32 teams administered opioids and other drugs, changes in practices over time, and the league's inconsistent recordkeeping all presented obstacles to a class-wide resolution of the 2014 lawsuit. The eight retired players who brought the case, including Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent, had proposed a class of all NFL players between 1973 and 2008 who received opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, local anesthetics or other medications. Alsup on Tuesday also said negligence, product liability and medical monitoring laws can vary between the 23 states implicated in the case. ""The Court is concerned that trial of plaintiffs’ proposed nationwide negligence class implicating the law of at least 23 different states would become a sprawling train wreck,"" the judge wrote. An NFL spokesman and the league's lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did the players' lawyers at Silverman Thompson Slutkin & White. Dent and the other plaintiffs sued the NFL in 2014, claiming the league spearheaded a ""return to play"" policy in which injured players were given painkillers and sent back into games, leading to further injuries. The players accused the league of negligence, negligent hiring and retention, fraud, and other claims on behalf of the proposed nationwide class. Alsup dismissed the case in 2015, finding that the players' union's bargaining agreement with the NFL precluded them from bringing the claims to court. The 9th Circuit in 2018 reversed, saying the NFL was not a party to those agreements. On remand, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint abandoning all but their negligence claims. Alsup in 2019 said the league could not be held liable because it was not directly involved in distributing or administering medications. But the 9th Circuit again disagreed with the judge, ruling last year that the players could succeed on their alternate theory that the NFL voluntarily took on the duty of overseeing the administration of drugs by regulating their use by teams. Alsup in February denied the NFL's motion to dismiss the ""voluntary undertaking"" claim, and the players then moved for class certification. But Alsup on Tuesday found there were too many variations between teams, states, and the NFL's supervision of each team over time to support a nationwide class. In the 2005 regular season, for example, the New York Jets dispensed nearly 470 doses of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Toradol, while the Indianapolis Colts a year earlier administered nearly 900, Alsup found. And the Jets administered more than twice as many Vicodin tablets in 2007 as in the previous year. ""Plaintiffs have provided no reason or evidence, other than exaggerated rhetoric, to believe that the least volume of medications was equally unreasonable to the most and that such differences are immaterial,"" Alsup wrote.

Britain to give third COVID-19 vaccine doses to immunosuppressed,2297,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Britain will give severely immunosuppressed people a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine to increase their chances of generating a better immune response, although officials stressed the offer was separate from any broader booster vaccine programme. With the move, Britain follows the United States, which last month authorised a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)-BioNTech and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from two-dose regimens. read more Public Health England on Wednesday said the decision to offer third doses to the immunosuppressed followed data that showed 40% of immunosuppressed people generated only low levels of antibodies from two vaccine shots. However, officials stressed the third dose was not a ""booster"" dose as it would be administered as part of the primary vaccination schedule and aimed at helping the initial process of generating an immune response. ""We want people with severely suppressed immune systems to have the best chance of gaining protection from COVID-19 via vaccination,"" said Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 Immunisation for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The JCVI's final advice on the broader booster programme for the elderly and vulnerable is expected soon. The committee previously said it could start this month. read more Third doses will be given to people with immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV/AIDS, and those who have received immunosuppressive treatments like chemotherapy. The move will impact less than 1% of the population, around 400-500,000 people. Officials said mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna should be used as the third dose, as there was more data on these shots, but AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) vaccine could be added later if the data supported the move. The government said it accepted the JCVI's advice. ""The NHS (National Health Service) will contact people as soon as possible to discuss their needs and arrange an appointment for a third dose where clinically appropriate,"" health minister Sajid Javid said. ""This is not the start of the booster programme – we are continuing to plan for this to begin in September."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Majority of U.S. companies may mandate COVID-19 vaccine in coming months - survey,2040,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - More than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment, according to a national survey of nearly 1,000 employers. In the face of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, spurred by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, that has strained the U.S. health care system, many companies have come out with mask mandates and changed their vaccination policies. Google's parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Walmart Inc (WMT.N), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine. read more The survey, which polled 961 U.S. companies that together employ around 9.7 million people, found that by the fourth quarter of 2021, over 52% of employers could have one or more vaccine mandate requirements, an increase from 21% currently. The mandates could range from requiring vaccination for staff to access common areas such as cafeterias to requiring vaccination for all employees, according to the survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson between Aug. 18 and 25. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. ""We expect even more employers to institute vaccine mandates in the wake of FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine,"" Willis Towers Watson's population health leader, Jeff Levin-Scherz, said. The survey found the number of employers that track whether employees have completed their vaccination was increasing, with more companies considering implementing financial incentives for vaccinations. About 62% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, while more than half or roughly 52% are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Tuesday, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

"More vaccines urgently needed in Latin America to contain Delta, says health agency",1791,"BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Three-quarters of the people in Latin America and the Caribbean have not been fully immunized against COVID-19 in contrast to the United States and Canada where a majority have been vaccinated, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. PAHO Director Carissa Etienne stressed the inequality in the access to vaccines in a region that has been disproportionately hit by the pandemic, with nearly a third of the world's deaths. ""We need more vaccine donations,"" she urged in a briefing from Washington, appealing to countries around the world with excess doses to quickly share them with the region to save lives. While vaccines lack in most countries, over half the population of the United States and more than 60% of the people of Canada, Chile and Uruguay have been fully vaccinated. The Americas region needs an additional 540 million doses to ensure that every country can cover at least 60% of its population, she said. ""The best way to protect against variants of concern, like the Delta variant, is to ensure more people are fully vaccinated everywhere,"" Etienne stressed. COVID-19 infections are surging again in North America and hospitalization rates among young people and adults below the age of 50 are higher today than at any other point in the pandemic, PAHO reported. COVID-19 outbreaks are accelerating in multiple Central American countries, especially Costa Rica and Belize, according to PAHO. In the Caribbean, Jamaica is seeing its highest-ever COVID death toll as its hospitals reach full capacity. In South America, infections are declining, except for Venezuela, where cases are plateauing, and Suriname, where transmission has increased for four consecutive weeks.

PMI Q2 2021: Corporate work puts on a dazzling performance,5754,"The record-breaking PMI performance in Q2 may have been driven in a large part by the hot corporate practice area, including M&A activity. But can it last? In the second quarter of 2021, the Thomson Reuters Peer Monitor Index (PMI) hit an all-time high, rocketing up 22 points to a previously untouchable score of 84, its greatest showing of all time. While we have gone to great effort to point out the myriad underlying conditions that had to line up just right to achieve it, this is still a phenomenal result which deserves a deeper look. At first glance the record-setting PMI can be credited to that ever-topical COVID-19 pandemic. For our purposes however, the pandemic served to create an exceptionally low baseline for compassion to current metrics. Unlike the great recession, this crisis has left the general health of the legal economy suppressed rather than damaged. As the suppression was removed the legal industry snapped back into full production. So, there you have it: Litigation’s 7.7% demand growth and Real Estate’s 17.6% growth? All beneficiaries of a low baseline. Once measured against 2019’s 2nd quarter, this massive growth evaporates to -0.9% and 1.6%, respectably. Like a stage magician’s illusion, what you perceive is largely a function of where you’re looking. Except, there is a problem. While at a first glance comparisons to the last “normal” year of 2019 show many practices flat or down, one practice stands out from the rest as deserving of the spotlight: corporate. Although the corporate practice group saw smaller 2021 vs. 2020 growth than real estate, its 2021 vs 2020 growth was still impressive at 12.7%. Importantly, we see that this growth is no illusion in the above figure, with 2021 vs 2019 growth at just over 11%. Quickly, let’s contrast it to litigation’s performance during the same period. In the above chart we can see that, in a Q2 2021 vs Q2 2020 matchup, corporate work is still well ahead of litigation in growth across all market segments. Litigation’s growth certainly appears respectable here as few firms would look askance at growing only 7.7%. Yet when we zoom out to our 2019 comparison, we see litigation is still below its “normal” baseline, having yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level. Corporate on the other hand? Its growth appears unflappable, with Am Law 100 firms seeing 15% demand growth above 2019’s levels. Consider that litigation makes up 29% of the large law firm hours tracked and corporate lords over an additional quarter portion. This quarter’s metrics become more impressive in light of this, as corporate carries flagging practices like litigation across the finish line into Q3. Except, once again, there is a problem. This figure displays how practices with higher demand growth tend to have higher lawyer growth as they require an ever-increasing number of professionals to sate demand. The inverse can also be shown as practices which are shrinking tend to bleed lawyers as prospective recruits look to hotter practice areas and old hands move to where the grass is greener. Mergers & acquisitions and general corporate are the two components of corporate (All) that in a year-to-date June 2021 vs 2020 comparison, were maintaining extremely high growth rates. Yet, they also go against the trend when it comes to recruiting. General corporate work is almost able to maintain the labor it already has despite its high practice growth. M&A has completely broken from the pack, hemorrhaging lawyers, down almost 3% YTD, even as it nears 15% practice demand growth. The most likely interpretation? Corporate work is growing so fast that, in a labor market where new blood is a rare commodity, their lawyers are experiencing intense burnout. M&A especially is undergoing a sort of “too much of a good thing” phase, where it’s growing so fast that the lawyers simply cannot keep up and are dropping out faster than they can be replaced. There are three potential ways this is likely to play out. The first is that corporate law firms turn down work they would have otherwise readily accepted because their operations have reached their breaking point. Secondly, firms feel reluctant to turn down work and the revenue that goes with it, and continue to take on work from an increasingly growing pool. The potential downside of this choice could be a further strain on resources resulting in reduced quality of work product – an outcome to be avoided for any lawyer. The third outcome is the most likely, as early indicators are signaling in its direction: full-time equivalent (FTE) growth increases as firms flood the market with recruiting dollars and larger salaries to attract the potential wave of associates expected to enter the market soon. In other words, the already hot legal labor market goes nuclear. No matter which way this turns out, corporate’s Q2 2021 performance is already locked in. This was a quarter in which the practice area played the leading role in powering the overall legal market to an all-time high, a performance which in contrast to its co-stars’ opportunism, was all its own brilliance.

"Italy reports 69 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, 6,503 new cases",946,"ROME, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Italy reported 69 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, down from 75 the previous day, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 6,503 from 5,498, the health ministry said.

"U.S. childcare in short supply as burned-out workers quit, new hires hard to find",7068,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Rochelle Wilcox, the owner of three childcare centers in New Orleans, receives 10 to 15 phone calls nearly every day for each school from parents asking if there is space for their children. But Wilcox has to turn them away. While her enrollment is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, she doesn't have the staff to take on more students. ""I have to say that we’re full,"" said Wilcox, who capped the wait list for the three schools at 140 children, compared to the more typical range of 45 to 60. She estimates the schools could accept nearly 40 more children if she could hire 10 more staffers. Childcare centers across the country are struggling to find enough qualified educators to be fully staffed for back-to-school season, an obstacle that has some schools reducing planned enrollment and cutting back hours. Owners of childcare centers say more workers are quitting and fewer people than usual are applying for open positions. The staffing crunch is further limiting childcare options for parents eager to get back to work. It also creates more hurdles for working mothers, who were disproportionately pushed out of the labor market when schools went virtual and childcare centers closed because of the pandemic. Without reliable childcare, it will become more difficult for those parents to return to steady work schedules, economists say, potentially slowing a labor market recovery that many had hoped would get a jolt as schools reopened this fall and which becomes even more critical as enhanced jobless benefits expire in September. Research released on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that women with children under age 6 made up 10% of the workforce before the pandemic but accounted for 22% of the jobs lost during the crisis. The ability to find quality childcare is ""likely to be a determining factor for employment"" for women with young children, Atlanta Fed researcher M. Melinda Pitts wrote in the report. Four out of five early childhood educators working at childcare centers said they were understaffed in late June and early July, according to a survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. More than one in three respondents said they were thinking about leaving or shutting down their centers this year. Recruiting childcare workers has always been difficult because wages are typically low - workers earn a median of $12 an hour according to the Labor Department - and the work is demanding. But those challenges were exacerbated by the pandemic, which put workers' health at risk and, with many quitting, created greater responsibilities for those who remained on the job. The renewed focus on the workforce is leading to a national conversation about early childhood educators and what needs to change to provide them with more opportunities and reduce turnover. ""I think what we’re going through right now is a revaluing of care work and understanding that care work is the work that makes all other work possible,"" said Mara Bolis, associate director of women's economic rights for Oxfam America. BURNING OUT Employment of child daycare workers plunged by 36% at the start of the pandemic after many centers shut down, greater than the roughly 15% drop in employment seen in the U.S. labor market overall, according to Labor Department data. Childcare employment was still down 11% from pre-pandemic levels as of July, compared to a 4% shortfall for the labor market overall. Some workers leaving the industry now say they are worried about the health risks or are burning out after being asked to work longer hours with less support. Some people are moving into more lucrative roles as nannies, which came into higher demand during the pandemic with daycare centers shuttering and as more families opted to keep their children at home. Amanda Chugg worked through the early part of the pandemic at a childcare center based in a hospital campus in Portland, Oregon. But she left in May of 2020 because too many of her colleagues were showing up to work sick and she was concerned about exposing her roommate, who is immunocompromised, to COVID-19. ""Having people coming to work sick is not uncommon in childcare,"" said Chugg, 26, who now works as a nanny taking care of two children, ages four and six. ""But with the onset of COVID it got to a place where it was untenable for me."" Jordan Potts, 21, realized it was time for a change after being asked to work multiple 12-hour shifts because the center she worked at in north Texas was short-staffed. Many of the teachers hired to help would leave after a week or two. ""It kind of clicked, the burnout,"" said Potts, who quit in August after about three years in the industry. Instead of caring for a room of about 10 one-year olds, Potts is now working as a full-time nanny caring for a five-month old baby. While her pay is about the same, her responsibilities as a nanny are more manageable, said Potts, who will start college in January and wants to be an elementary school teacher. SEEKING SOLUTIONS Owners of childcare centers say they want to boost wages to retain more workers. But they argue they are limited in terms of how much more they can offer before they have to start raising tuition - putting more pressure on families already struggling to afford childcare. That tension is not new, but some childcare center owners feel they are competing more intensely with retailers, restaurants and other businesses that are better able to increase pay or sweeten benefits to attract more workers during the pandemic. Wilcox, the owner of the childcare centers in New Orleans, increased hourly wages for all of her staff this spring, going from a range of $10 to $13 per hour to a range of $12 to $16. But she still hasn't been able to fill all of her openings. In addition to better wages, early childhood educators say they need more opportunity for growth within the field, support from staff and broader access to health insurance, sick time and other benefits. Megan Ahern initially envisioned she would spend her evenings coming up with creative lesson plans when she started teaching pre-Kindergarten full-time in Eugene, Oregon, in September of 2020. But after struggling to afford groceries on her teacher paycheck alone, the 25-year-old started delivering food through Uber Eats after school. She worked close to 12 hours a day between the two jobs. Ahern, who quit the school at the end of August, said she didn't have the resources needed for her classroom, which included some children with special needs. Some of the children would hit, bite or pee on her. She was so overwhelmed she often found herself shedding tears during her 30-minute lunch breaks. Ahern's pay was increased to $17 an hour from $13 an hour in early August, but it wasn't enough to change her mind. ""Ideally I’ll be able to come back to working with kids at some point,"" said Ahern, who plans to keep delivering food until she finds another job. ""But I just need a break.""

"'Oh, that's an idea...': U.S. parents respond to China screen time ban",3076,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - (This 31st August story corrected a spelling error in paragraph 4) Raleigh Smith Duttweiler was folding laundry in her Ohio home, her three children playing the video game Minecraft upstairs, when she heard an NPR story about new rules in China that forbid teenagers and children under age 18 from playing video games for more than three hours a week. ""Oh, that's an idea,"" Duttweiler, who works in public relations at a nonprofit, recalls thinking. ""My American gut instinct: This is sort of an infringement on rights and you don't get to tell us what to do inside of our own homes. ""On the other hand, it's not particularly good for kids to play as much as even my own children play. And I do think it would be a lot easier to turn it off if it wasn't just arguing with Mommy, but actually saying 'Well, the police said so.'"" For Duttweiler and many families outside of China, Monday's news of the country's strict social intervention - which regulators said was needed to stop a growing addiction to what it once described as ""spiritual opium"" - underscores a challenge to rein in video game use in their own homes, particularly during the pandemic. China's regulator said the new rules were a response to growing concern that games affected the physical and mental health of children, a fear echoed by parents and experts in the United States. Paul Morgan, a father of two teenagers and Penn State professor who studies electronic device use, sees flaws in the ban while acknowledging the challenge of controlling children's screen time. ""These electronic devices are ubiquitous,"" Morgan said. ""It's really hard to get kids away from them."" Yet Morgan says negative associations with screen time are particularly evident for heavy users, possibly due to displacing activities like exercise or sleep. The ban doesn't address social media use, which is thought to be especially harmful for girls. And some populations, such as students with disabilities, may benefit from the social interactions provided by video games. Shira Weiss, a New Jersey-based publicist for technology clients including a video game company, sees value in the games that help keep her twin 12-year-old sons connected to their peers, but wants to better limit how often they play the more violent games. ""I think the Chinese rules are good,"" Weiss said. ""You're still saying 'Play video games,' but you're just setting limits."" She added, partially joking: ""Can they come here and impose that restriction on my house?"" Michael Gural-Maiello, who works in business development at an engineering firm and has an 11-year-old son, believes parents should be the ones regulating their children's video game use. ""I don't think governments really have a place in telling parents how their children should be spending their time,"" Gural-Maiello said. ""China has a rotten record in technology in general. I'd be far more worried about my son using apps that originate in China that collect data than I am about him playing Mario Kart."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Cuba prepares to vaccinate its children, entire population",2617,"HAVANA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Cuba will begin vaccinating adolescents against COVID-19 this week and younger children from mid-September as part of a drive to immunize more than 90% of the population by December, state-run media said on Wednesday. All children ages 2 through 18 will receive at least two doses of the Cuban-developed Soberana-2 vaccine beginning Sept. 3, the official Cubadebate digital news outlet reported. Health Ministry official Ileana Morales Suarez was quoted as saying the campaign would resemble annual vaccinations against various childhood diseases, taking place at thousands of community-based family medical practices and clinics. Trials of the vaccine in minors found it to be safe and that it elicited a stronger immune response than in adults, according to state-owned manufacturer Finlay Institute. The decision was announced at a weekly meeting of leaders and scientists to confront the pandemic on the Communist-run Caribbean island currently battling a Delta variant-driven surge that has strained its health system and hit the younger population much harder than previous versions of the virus. Over the past week, Cuba averaged between 6,500 and 7,000 cases per day and 70 to 80 deaths, down significantly from a few weeks ago but still one of the highest rates in the world in terms of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Vaccination of the adult population primarily using another locally-developed shot, Abdala, will be stepped up with the goal of ensuring all eligible adults have at least begun the three-shot-treatment by the end of the month. Cubans are desperate to get their kids back in school after months of home schooling, a prospect postponed again this September. The country is suffering shortages of everything from food and medicine to parts and inputs for power plants and agriculture, due to closure of the tourism industry, tough U.S. sanctions and its own inefficiencies. It desperately wants to tame the disease in time for the tourism season that begins in November. Both Cuban vaccines, with a reported efficacy of more than 90%, have been approved by local regulators for emergency use, although the data has not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. In the capital, Havana, where more than 60% of the 2.2 million residents are fully vaccinated, cases and deaths per 100,000 residents are far below the national average, according to government statistics. Currently around 50% of Cuba's 11.3 million residents have received at least one dose of vaccine, with more than 3.5 million fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Well-vaccinated countries should prioritise COVAX over booster shots - WHO's Tedros,900,"BERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation recommends against using spare doses of COVID-19 vaccine to give booster shots to countries' fully-vaccinated populations, since the priority is to ensure the global population is vaccinated, the agency's head said. Speaking in Berlin at the opening of a new epidemic intelligence hub, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries with spare vaccines available to donate any deliveries they received in the near term to COVAX or other initiatives aimed at sharing doses with poorer countries. ""For now, we do not want to see widespread use of boosters for healthy people who are fully vaccinated,"" he said. ""We call on countries that have contracted high volumes of vaccines to swap near-term delivery schedules with COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, or AVAT.""

"Italy extends COVID-19 Green Pass to trains, planes, ferries and coaches",2073,"ROME, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Italy broadened usage of Green Pass health documents on Wednesday, making them obligatory for anyone travelling on high-speed trains, planes, ferries and inter-regional coaches. The Green Pass is a digital or paper certificate that shows whether someone has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, has tested negative or has recently recovered from the virus. Prime Minister Mario Draghi introduced the pass earlier in the summer to try to prevent infections and encourage people to get vaccinated. It was initially needed to enter many cultural and leisure venues, but its scope has gradually been widened. The scheme has triggered protests by some Italians who say it tramples on freedoms, and opponents had vowed to block railway traffic on Wednesday to show their dissent. In the event only a handful of people showed up at the demonstrations. Some 70% of all Italians over the age of 12 are now fully vaccinated and the vast majority of people seem to back the inoculation drive and the use of the Green Pass. ""They are right to ask for a Green Pass. If you don't want to get the vaccine then stay at home and don't travel,"" Rome resident Alessia Colombi said at the city's main train station. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio on Tuesday denounced what he called a ""climate of hatred"" against the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, after he and a number of other politicians and medical experts received threats on social media. read more The government has already said teachers will need a Green Pass when schools reopen this month after the summer holidays. Last week, officials said they were considering extending the scheme to anyone working in a public office or a supermarket. Some 129,221 people have died of coronavirus in Italy since the pandemic hit last year, the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain. New cases held relatively steady in August, but doctors fear the more contagious Delta variant could cause a fresh spike in infections in the coming weeks.

"Swiss trainers resign amid abuse allegations, poor performance",2080,"ZURICH, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Trainers for the Swiss Gymnastics Federation's (STV) women's team resigned en masse on Wednesday following an ethics investigation that upheld athletes' complaints of psychological abuse and after a series of poor performances. The ethics committee's report, which was presented to the STV's leadership on Aug. 27 and made public on Wednesday, recommended cutting ties with the coaching staff. ""By mutual agreement, it was decided that the current coaching team would relinquish the leadership of training with immediate effect and be released from their duties,"" the federation said in a statement. The committee's investigation found violations of the Swiss Olympic Ethics Charter during the period from 2016 to 2019 ""and that in particular the mental and physical health of female athletes was not sufficiently protected"". The STV initiated the review in November after two athletes said they had faced harsh training conditions and disparaging comments about their eating habits and body weight. ""I am deeply saddened by the investigation report and apologise on behalf of the STV to those affected for what happened,"" STV Director Beatrice Wertli said. ""The psychological and physical integrity of the athletes is our top priority."" The STV described the resignations as a fresh start for the women's team, which - with the exception of star Guilia Steingruber, a 2016 Rio Olympic Games bronze medallist - had no realistic chance of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati announced Tuesday that it will extend a series of wellness-related benefits and resources – including offering an extra two weeks of paid time off – to ward off stress from the ongoing pandemic. In addition to its regular vacation plan, the Silicon Valley-founded firm said the extra two weeks comes with billable-hour credit. According to Cherie Beffa, Wilson Sonsini's director of attorney recruiting, the firm is continuingsome wellness initiatives from last June, and that this offer is designed to make its employees ""feel that they can take time to focus on their own well-being."" ""This isn't a vacation. This is 'go take two weeks to do what you need to do and take care of yourself,' and that can be for anything,"" she said. Recognizing that people are struggling with different issues, Beffa added that Wilson Sonsini has partnered with on-demand mental healthcare company Ginger to create an emotional support program that provides free, virtual behavioral health coaches to employees and their dependents. ""The genesis is giving people real-time help when they need it and giving them a vehicle to do that,"" Beffa said. ""And it's been hugely popular. People are using it for different reasons. Sometimes people have serious mental health issues that they need to talk through. Sometimes it's stress management ... it's all different things."" With the Delta variant causing a new surge of COVID-19 cases Wilson Sonsini is also offering both COVID-19 and flu vaccines in its Palo Alto office. As of now, the firm has pushed its office reopening date to October. However, according to Beffa, Wilson Sonsini has continued to provide flexible work arrangements to its employees. ""It's also afforded us the luxury of being able to bring people back to the firm who had left the firm because they moved into a geography that we didn't have an office,"" Beffa added. She also noted that Wilson Sonsini had raised associate salaries to match the new scale set by Davis Polk & Wardwell and kept up with the special bonuses that many large law firms are now to retain and attract young talent. In March, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe unveiled an ""unplugged week"" initiative, which encourages all timekeepers to receive 40 hours of billable credit for taking time off. Orrick in November also announced that its associates caring for children and elderly parents could temporarily work reduced hours at full pay during the pandemic.

Japan finds another Moderna vial suspected to contain foreign substance,2701,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Japan reported a fresh contamination case involving Moderna's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine, the fourth such incident in less than a week, threatening to slow the country's sputtering inoculation campaign. Kanagawa prefecture said on Tuesday several black particles in one Moderna vaccine vial were found upon checking for foreign substances before its use, and it has put the rest of the lot on hold. Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of Moderna shots last week after being notified of contamination in some of the supply. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines, have said the cause could be a manufacturing issue, and European safety regulators have launched an investigation. Moderna has said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified from the issue. No similar Moderna incident has been reported in other countries. Kanagawa prefecture said the vaccine's domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T), had collected the vial with the suspected contaminant and that about 3,790 people had already received shots from the same lot. More Moderna shots were temporarily halted in two other regions this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off when needles are incorrectly inserted. Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kanagawa incident. The company posted a notice on its website on Wednesday saying that on rare occasions during manufacturing, rubber stopper material can get mixed into the vaccine solution. Japan's health ministry, citing an investigation by Takeda, said on Wednesday that the vial sent to Kanagawa was from a different lot than the other lots, and rubber stopper material appears to have gone into it during the manufacturing process. Rovi did not have an immediate comment to a Reuters' request for an update on its investigation. Medical staff are advised to do a visual inspection of vials for discoloration or foreign materials before use, the notice said. The contamination incidents come as Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with daily infections exceeding 25,000 in August for the first time. Tokyo reported on Wednesday 3,168 more cases, with NHK citing 20,031 new cases nationwide. Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 45.4% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Oxford Nanopore to launch $3.4 bln London IPO in coming weeks - sources,1807,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Oxford Nanopore, a provider of rapid COVID-19 tests to the UK’s national health service, is working with banks to launch an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange in the coming weeks - a deal that would strengthen Britain's efforts to lure life science businesses to its main market. The company aims to build on the 2.48 billion pounds ($3.42 billion) valuation achieved in a funding round in May, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Oxford-based life sciences firm, which counts IP Group and Singapore's Temasek among its shareholders, provides DNA/RNA sequencing technology for sectors such as biomedical, pathogen, plant and animal scientific research, infectious diseases and food and agriculture. It has also worked on rapid COVID-19 tests. The deal will add to a crowded pipeline of share sales expected to launch in London and other European centres in the last IPO window of the year as 2021 looks set for record volumes of new listings, dominated by tech and e-commerce businesses. The Oxford Nanopore listing is a major win for London's main market as most biotech firms typically list on the LSE's junior AIM bourse before floating on Nasdaq - home to some of the world's biggest drugmakers - after reaching a certain size. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. Bank of America (BAC.N), Citi (C.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) are global coordinators for the London listing. In May, Oxford Nanopore held a 195 million pound funding round that saw Temasek, Wellington Management, M&G Investments and Nikon becoming new investors in the company.

English study finds long COVID affects up to 1 in 7 children months after infection,2032,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As many as 1 in 7 children may have symptoms linked to the coronavirus months after testing positive for COVID-19, the authors of an English study on long COVID in adolescents said on Wednesday. Children rarely become severely ill with COVID-19 but they can suffer lingering symptoms, and the study is one of the largest of its kind on how common so-called long COVID is in the age group. The study, led by University College London and Public Health England, found that 11- to 17-year-olds who tested positive for the virus were twice as likely to report three or more symptoms 15 weeks later than those who had tested negative. Researchers surveyed 3,065 11- to 17-year-olds in England who had positive results in a PCR test between January and March, and a control group of 3,739 11- to 17-year-olds who tested negative over the same period. Among those who tested positive, 14% reported three or more symptoms such as unusual tiredness or headaches 15 weeks later, compared with 7% reporting symptoms by that time among the control group. The researchers said that while the findings suggested as many as 32,000 teenagers might have had multiple symptoms linked to COVID-19 after 15 weeks, the prevalence of long COVID in the age group was lower than some had feared last year. ""Overall, it's better than people would've guessed back in December,"" Professor Terence Stephenson of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, told reporters. The findings were a pre-print which had not been peer-reviewed. The authors said that any decision to extend vaccination to 12- to 15-year-olds in Britain was unlikely to be based on this study as there was not enough data on whether vaccination protects against long COVID. ""We are getting increasing evidence on the safety of the vaccine in the 12- to 15-year-olds and that's more likely to be taken into consideration,"" Liz Whittaker, a paediatrician at Imperial College London, told reporters.

China ramps up healthcare reform with pilot pricing scheme,2217,"BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China stepped up its reform of public healthcare service pricing mechanisms with the announcement of a pilot programme aimed at ensuring proper compensation for service providers and affordable costs for consumers. The plan comes after China had blocked some channels that allowed public hospitals to earn revenues from medical devices and drug sales. The measure reduced over-prescription and illegal rebates but also increased public healthcare operators' reliance on medical services to support their staff. The new scheme is also aimed at rectifying weaknesses in current pricing mechanisms, where some services are priced too low and medical professionals do not participate in the government's price-setting process sufficiently. ""(Price increase) will be inevitable to make sure doctors' income remains reasonable,"" said Zhao Bing, a China Renaissance Securities analyst, noting reduced revenue streams for public healthcare operators due to restrictions in sales of drugs and medical devices. Zhao said the rule does not necessarily mean consumer costs will also increase, as state insurance will help cover the bill. The pilot programme guideline will specify how public hospitals should adjust service prices and involve both increases and decreases, but will avoid excessive increases in costs, according to the guideline issued late on Wednesday. The government plans to start the pilot programme in five cities before national launch by 2025, the guideline said. Under the scheme, authorities will set guide pricing for most services at public institutions, and services eligible for market-driven pricing will be limited. Private hospitals will be allowed to use market-driven pricing plans, but China will strengthen its regulation and, when necessary, take action such as pricing investigations, summoning hospital operators and public disclosure of price irregularities, according to the guideline. Shares in private service provider Aier Eye Hospitals Group (300015.SZ) fell as much as 4.4% on Wednesday before closing 1.4% higher.

Wood's bet on Zoom and other pandemic winners such as online healthcare service provider Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC.N) had helped her ARK Innovation's portfolio outperform all other U.S. equity funds in 2020, although the fund has lagged this year. Asset manager Ark Invest said it added about $45.5 million shares of Zoom to the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK.P) and about $11 million in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF . The video conferencing company issued a dour forecast of 31% rise in third-quarter revenue compared with the multiple-fold growth rates seen last year amid remote work and schooling. Its shares have nearly halved in value compared to their peak in October last year as the pandemic-boom started to fade. Meanwhile, the $25.5 billion ARKK is down about 2% for the year, clawing back from losses of about 22%. Separately, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF.P) added about $11.5 million shares of Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD.O).

Portugal lifts COVID-19 travel ban on tourists from Brazil,1553,"LISBON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Portugal said on Wednesday it would allow entry for tourists from Brazil, nearly 18 months after it imposed a ban on non-essential travel from the Portuguese-speaking South American nation to stem the spread of coronavirus. Although Brazilians, who make up Portugal's biggest expatriate community, were allowed access for reasons such as work, family or health, the lifting of the tourism ban has been long-awaited. Portugal is now open to tourists from the European Union who present the bloc's digital COVID-19 certificate, as well as the United States, from where visitors must show a negative test result on arrival. Travellers from Brazil now no longer need to quarantine but must provide a negative COVID-19 test. The same rule applies to visitors from Britain, according to the government.

Passengers from nations such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Singapore and Canada will also be able to travel to Portugal if they provide a negative test. Visitors from Nepal, India and South Africa are still required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival and must only be travelling for essential reasons.

"Frenchwoman officially considered dead fights to be ""alive"" again",3348,"SAINT-JOSEPH, France, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Declared dead by a French court in 2017, Jeanne Pouchain has spent the past four years trying to escape a bewildering legal twilight zone and prove to officialdom that she is in fact very much alive. She says the experience has been devastating. ""My name was Jeanne. It still is Jeanne, after I've been declared dead in 2017,"" says the 59-year old, smoking cigarette after cigarette. She breaks into tears at times when recounting her ordeal - and what she plans for when she will officially be ""alive"" again. It all started, Pouchain recalls, when the family received a letter four years ago from a court saying mistakenly that she was dead and that her husband and son had to pay for money she was alleged to have owed. The letter was part of a complicated legal procedure launched by a former employee of Pouchain's cleaning business and, unlike what they had assumed at first, it was not easy, or quick, to clear up the error. Pouchain, unable to work and afraid to leave her house because she had no valid ID or social security number anymore, started living as a recluse. Some of the family's belongings were seized by court bailiffs, while all their savings, and more, went into trying to get things back to normal. ""My life, well, it's nothing. I feel I'm of no use. I'm nothing and I'm of no use. And this is hard,"" Pouchain says, speaking to Reuters in the house she shares with her husband Pierre-Jean in a small village near Lyon, in south-east France. But with the courts looking at her case again, Pouchain and her husband have begun to have some hope again. Although it may still be months before her bid to get the case against her revised, and for a judge to officially recognise that she is not dead and should never have been considered dead, she has drawn up a list of what she wants to do when that happens. Jeanne Pouchain poses with her husband Pierre-Jean Pouchain during an interview with Reuters at her home, detailing the ordeal she has been leaving through since being declared dead by a judge, in Saint-Joseph, near Lyon, August 30, 2021. REUTERS/Cecile Mantovani After years of hardships, the priority will be her health. ""I know exactly what I will do ... I will get a health check, because I know some things are wrong with my body,"" she said, adding that, because she could not get proper treatment for lack of a valid social security card, she has only six teeth left, among a series of health issues. ""I would so love to be able to bite into an apple ... I would love to have teeth. I would be so happy, even if they were to give me two dentures, I would be happy to have teeth."" Her other dream is simply to be able to enjoy life again, at home, with her husband. ""During the day, I manage to feel more or less alive, but my nights are awful. I wake up after an hour and a half because it haunts my nights,"" she said. Her husband, Pierre-Jean Pouchain, while speaking of how hard this all has been, also wants to be optimistic. ""Hope is what makes us carry on,"" he said. ""Eventually, the outcome will necessarily be in our favour."" ""It will take the time that is needed,"" he added, ""but we're not asking for something extraordinary ... on some things there can be doubts but, between dead or alive, there is no doubt.""

No tougher Swiss coronavirus curbs for now despite rising cases,2136,"ZURICH, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Switzerland will not tighten curbs on public life for now despite rising coronavirus cases, the government said on Wednesday, reserving the right to make people show a COVID-status certificate to access many indoor spaces. The government had signalled such a move last week when it ordered millions more doses of COVID-19 vaccine for possible use as booster shots,amid concerns that a rising number of serious cases could soon overwhelm hospitals. read more ""The number of hospital admissions of coronavirus patients remains high, but has not increased in the last week. Therefore, the (cabinet) has not yet decided (on widening use of certificates) today,"" a government statement said on Wednesday. It would decide on measures to relieve hospitals ""at any time should this become necessary"", it added. The certificate provides proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test result. President Guy Parmelin acknowledged at a news conference in Bern that the government's plans had provoked a lively debate about how far it should intrude into people's lives, but appealed for national unity. ""The enemy remains the virus, not fellow citizens of a different opinion,"" he said. The number of new infections in Switzerland and tiny neighbour Liechtenstein has picked up again to surpass 780,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll has exceeded 10,500. Just over half the Swiss population has been fully vaccinated, Health Minister Alain Berset said last week, but a third of adults remained unjabbed. He pointed to lower vaccination rates than in neighbouring countries. The government also unveiled an extra 60 million Swiss francs ($65.5 million) in support for the hard-hit tourism sector, aiming to boost demand and encourage innovation. The state is providing around 17 billion francs in coronavirus relief in 2021, around the same as in 2020.

Pandemic accelerates depletion of U.S. Social Security trust funds -Treasury,1819,"WASHINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will cause the main U.S. Social Security trust fund reserves to be depleted in 2033, a year sooner than an estimate made a year ago, as a steep drop in employment shrank revenue, the U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday. The Treasury said the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which pays retirement benefits, would be able to pay 76% of scheduled benefits after 2033 from continuing payroll tax revenues. Social Security's separate Disability Insurance Trust Fund will see its reserves depleted in 2057, eight years sooner than last year's estimate. Combined, the two Social Security trust fund reserves will be depleted in 2034, a year earlier than the estimate made a year ago, Treasury said. The Medicare Hospital Insurance Fund reserves are expected to be depleted in 2026, the same as last year's estimate. This will allow Medicare to pay only 91% of scheduled ""Part A"" hospital and other benefits from expected revenues at that time, Treasury said. Part of the reason for the stable depletion date is the higher mortality rate from COVID-19, which reduces some long-term care costs, offset by higher expected healthcare costs for people weakened by the virus, a Department of Health and Human Services official told reporters. Annual reports on both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds again said that congressional action will be needed in coming years to shore up the programs financially, by increasing revenue, cutting benefits, or finding other cost savings. An added twist to this year's Social Security report is a 3.1% estimated upward cost-of-living adjustment for benefits in 2021, the highest in a decade, due to higher inflation rates caused in part by supply shortages during the pandemic.

Rwandan president removes justice minister amid 'Hotel Rwanda' hero trial,2280,"KIGALI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Rwanda's President Paul Kagame has removed the justice minister but made him ambassador to Britian amid international scrutiny over the trial of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier credited with saving many lives during the 1994 genocide. A government statement issued on Tuesday gave no reason for the dismissal of Johnston Busingye, who had served as justice minister and attorney general since 2013. Busingye was appointed Rwanda's ambassador to Britain, the statement said. Kagame did not immediately name a new justice minister. Requests for comment to government spokespeople and the presidency office were not answered. Rusesabagina was hailed as hero after he used his connections as the manager of a Kigali hotel to save ethnic Tutsis from slaughter during the genocide. He was portrayed in the 2004 Hollywood film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Now he is accused of nine terrorism-related charges, including forming and funding an armed rebel group. Before his arrest, Rusesabagina, who was living in the United States, was a vocal critic of the Kagame government. Prosecutors have requested a life sentence for Rusesabagina, whose family says he is in poor health and being mistreated in prison. The court is scheduled to issue its verdict on Sept. 20. In an interview with Qatar-based Al Jazeera news channel in February, then Minister Busingye said the government had paid for the flight that brought Rusesabagina to Rwanda last year, which Rusesabagina's family said resulted in his kidnapping. Rusesabagina's trial has drawn attention to Kagame, whom rights groups say has used authoritarian tactics to crush political opposition and extend his rule.

UK regulator clears broadcaster over Piers Morgan's Meghan comments,2483,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - High-profile television personality Piers Morgan did not breach Britain's broadcasting code in his criticism of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" show earlier this year, Britain's media regulator ruled on Wednesday. The programme in March, in which Morgan said he did not believe a word Meghan had said in a landmark interview she and her husband Prince Harry gave to Oprah Winfrey, attracted more than 50,000 complaints. Most concerned comments Morgan made on mental health and suicide. Meghan, who during the Winfrey interview revealed she had felt suicidal while living as a royal in Britain,complained to both Ofcom and ITV about the programme. Morgan left his jobon the show following the incident. read more ""Our decision is that overall the programme contained sufficient challenge to provide adequate protection and context to its viewers,"" Ofcom said. In an interview that shook Britain's monarchy, Meghan, a Hollywood actor who married Prince Harry in 2018, said the royal family had also rejected her pleas for mental health support. The couple have stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States. Morgan, a former presenter on CNN, has accused the couple of damaging the royal family and seeking publicity on their own terms without accepting the responsibility and scrutiny that come with their position. He had also dubbed her ""Princess Pinocchio"" in a tweet. ""I'm delighted OFCOM has endorsed my right to disbelieve the Duke & Duchess of Sussex’s incendiary claims to Oprah Winfrey, many of which have proven to be untrue,"" Morgan said on Twitter. ""This is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios. Do I get my job back?"" A U.S.-based spokesperson for the Sussexes was not immediately available for comment out of working hours. Ofcom said that while it was concerned about Morgan's apparent disregard for the seriousness of anyone expressing suicidal thought, the extensive challenge offered by his colleagues throughout the show provided sufficient context. The broadcasting code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views, including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive, Ofcom said. ""The restriction of such views would, in our view, be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience,"" it said.

Hair cuts and dining in as Thai malls reopen after virus cases ease,1886,"BANGKOK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Thailand allowed shopping malls in the capital Bangkok to reopen on Wednesday and restaurants to operate at half capacity, after nearly three months of tough restrictions aimed at containing the country's worst coronavirus outbreak. The move comes after infections numbers started falling in the middle of last month and with the government under pressure to ease lockdown measures due to the impact on the economy. ""Thai citizens like me...will come back to normal life,"" said Wanvipa Luepromchian, who was getting her hair cut in a salon in the Siam Paragon mall in Bangkok. The government in Julystarted imposing strict measures including closing malls and prohibiting restaurant dining as the number of new infections surged due to the Delta variant. At its peak, authorities reported over 23,000 new cases in a single day in mid-August. On Wednesday, the health ministry reported 14,802 new cases and 252 additional deaths. Thailand has overall reported 1.2 million cases and 11,841 fatalities. ""If you (the government) lockdown everything that's so dangerous for the economy in Thailand,"" Wanvipa said. Last week, the government also allowed some domestic flights to resume. Restaurants dining can also restart, but at half the capacity to allow for social distancing. ""Customers need to get temperatures checked before entering and keep social distancing with only two people on one table, but if they are family, they can be seated together,"" said restaurant manager Nichapha Jiwvaganont. While a night time curfew remains in place in Bangkok, the partial reopening will be supportive for Thailand's struggling economy. A joint business group on Wednesday raised its 2021 economic forecast from between a 0.5% contraction to 1% growth from a contraction of 1.5% to 0% growth as curbs were relaxed.

COVID vaccine mandates - and prizes - boost uptake among Palestinians,2303,"GAZA/RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept 1 (Reuters) - After mandating vaccinations for workers and many students - and offering prize money - to nudge a sceptical public to get the jab, Palestinian officials report a big boost in vaccine uptake they hope will stem a surge in COVID-19 infections. Officials in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank announced the new rules last week after many shunned the vaccine due to misinformation online - even as authorities accumulated enough doses to cover most Palestinians over 12. read more In addition to mandating jabs for public sector workers and those in jobs dealing with the public, as well as teachers and students above 15, Gaza now offers a chance at $200 - a hefty sum for Palestinians in the impoverished territory - to anyone over 50 who gets inoculated. Ten winners are chosen daily. More Palestinians in Gaza have taken the vaccine in the past week - some 133,000 - than in the entire six-month period prior, health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. The West Bank has registered a similar jump in vaccinations. Samer Al-Asad, a Palestinian Authority (PA) health ministry official in the West Bank, attributed the increased uptake to ""people's desire to go back to normal life...The vaccine is the only and shortest way to curb the spread of the virus."" Despite the recent boost, however, just 19.5% of Palestinians in Gaza and 41% in the West Bank are vaccinated, according to PA health ministry data. Officials privately worry the current increases will eventually taper off. New infections in the West Bank and Gaza have surged since the global emergence of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. PA health officials began administering vaccines in West Bank schools this week to keep up the momentum. At one school in the village of Dura, near Hebron, 11th-grader Youssef Sharif said he trusted the science behind the jab. ""Scientists won't do anything unless they are sure of it. In my opinion, everyone should get vaccinated,"" he said. At a Gaza vaccination centre, Hassan Al-Farana said he was initially sceptical but decided to get the jab after some of his family members did so. ""We got vaccinated, and we found it wasn't harmful,"" the 43-year-old Palestinian said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealanders venture out as COVID-19 curbs eased in most regions,2354,"WELLINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - New Zealanders on Wednesday visited beaches and queued for takeaway food as tough lockdown measures enforced to beat an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus were eased for most of the country. About 1.7 million people in the largest city Auckland still remain in strict level 4 lockdown for another two weeks, but restrictions for the remainder of the country were loosened. read more Surfers and kayakers were seen heading to the beaches in droves, local media reports said, while other outdoor recreation facilities like golf courses were busy again.

REUTERS/Fiona Goodall Except for a small number of cases in February, New Zealand was largely coronavirus-free until the outbreak of the Delta variant prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. The country reported 75 new cases of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, up from 49 a day earlier. Of those, 74 were in Auckland and one was a household contact in Wellington. The total cases from the current outbreak rose to 687, nearly all in Auckland. ""The latest bounce in numbers is not unexpected,"" the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference, adding it was still below the peak daily number. Ardern's lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, have been credited with reining in COVID-19 allowing the country to live largely without restrictions. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israeli students return to school amid surge in COVID-19 cases,2490,"JERUSALEM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Israeli pupils returned to school on Wednesday with mask requirements and mandatory COVID-19 testing aimed at stemming a surge in coronavirus cases that has overshadowed the highly-vaccinated country's reopening. Health officials worry the launch of a new school year - with most students attending in-person - will exacerbate the current wave ahead of this month's Jewish holiday season, potentially forcing another national lockdown. New infections have soared since the emergence of the Delta variant, reaching a pandemic-high 10,947 on Tuesday among Israel's 9.3 million population. Under what he calls a ""living with COVID"" policy, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has pressed ahead with the new school year, in part by ramping up vaccine booster shots and requiring testing for students and unvaccinated instructors. Visiting a school in Israel's Negev desert, Bennett said the testing effort - some 2 million tests were conducted - was the largest in Israel's history. ""After a year of Zooming, a difficult year of fading and staring in front of the screens, I want to wish you, the students of Israel, this one thing: May the year of screens be done away, and a year of experiences begin,"" Bennett said. But Bennett's government announced the new measures just days before classes resumed, drawing criticism from parents who say they were given little time to prepare. Gal Altberg said she was excited to send her children, in 1st and 3rd grade, back to school but worried there might still be a lockdown amid the rise in infections. ""The policy is still up in the air, the government changes things around but we are hoping for (the best), and we are hoping that the vaccinations will help,"" Altberg, 41, said. Students under 12 - the minimum age of eligibility for the vaccine - must present their teachers with a parent's note confirming they performed a rapid test at home and received a negative result. Such testing is not required beyond the first day. But officials say further testing could be done before or after the Jewish holidays, where large family gatherings are common. The first of those festivals is on Sept. 6 and the last on Sept. 30. In areas with particularly high infection, schools where less than 70% of students are vaccinated are required to conduct remote learning. Around 10% of Israeli students will attend school online on Wednesday, according to the YNet news website. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Warnings as Southeast Asia's biggest economies ease COVID-19 curbs,3138,"BANGKOK/JAKARTA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As Indonesia and Thailand start to ease COVID-19 curbs after seeing case numbers fall, health experts say cases of new infections could rise again with vaccination rates still low. After containing the coronavirus better than much of the world last year, Southeast Asia has turned into a global epicentre in recent months with the arrival of the virulent Delta variant. Although case numbers are still rising fast in most of the region, Indonesia and Thailand, which have its largest economies, have started to lift curbs on dine-in restaurants and shopping malls to ease the economic pain of their lockdowns. Indonesia reported 10,534 new cases on Tuesday, five times fewer than its peak in mid-July, while Thailand reported 14,802 new cases on Wednesday, down 37% from its mid-August peak. However, experts said relaxations carried dangers with a low level of vaccination and a shortage of testing, with rates of positive tests often above the 5% recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). ""We are definitely concerned around the reopening without meeting all the criteria proposed by the WHO,"" Abhishek Rimal, Asia Pacific Emergency Health Coordinator at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told Reuters. ""Now with the Delta variant, which is highly transmissible, and the low vaccination rate, we could very well see a surge of COVID-19 in days to come."" Indonesia has recently had a positive test rate of 12% and Thailand 34%. ""Surveillance is not that great, we still need to be careful,"" said Tri Yunis Miko Wahyono, a University of Indonesia epidemiologist. Indonesia has recorded more than 4 million coronavirus cases in total and more than 133,000 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Thailand has reported 11,841 deaths and 1.2 million cases. The two countries both have first vaccination rates at around 30% with Indonesia having fully vaccinated 17% and Thailand 11%. Their capitals, Jakarta and Bangkok, have much higher levels of vaccination. In Jakarta and some areas on the populous Java island, restaurants inside shopping malls could have a 50% dine-in capacity, and shopping malls could stay open until 9 p.m., while factories are permitted to operate at 100% capacity. Bangkok and 28 other provinces listed as having the most severe outbreaks can similarly reopen dine-in restaurants at a capacity between 50%-75%, with opening hours capped at 8 p.m., the same as shopping malls. ""The situation is getting better because many people are getting vaccinated and they are being more cautious,"" said restaurant customer Orrapin Peenanee, queuing in Bangkok. The economic benefits of easing lockdowns were understandable, said Dale Fisher, a senior infectious disease expert at the National University Hospital in Singapore, but he stressed that they also must vaccinate their citizens faster. ""As you ease off the lockdowns, how much sort of punishment can you take before you have to bring a lockdown back in and be and be stronger? The answer's in the vaccine,"" he said.

Philippines health workers protest neglect as COVID-19 strains hospitals,2146,"MANILA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Scores of healthcare workers protested in the Philippine capital on Wednesday to demand an end to what they called government neglect and unpaid benefits, as pressure builds at hospitals fighting one of Asia's longest-running coronavirus epidemics. Protesters wearing protective medical gear gathered at the Department of Health (DOH) and held placards demanding their risk allowances and hazard pay, and the resignation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque. The Philippines passed the 2 million mark in coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a fifth of those recorded in the past month alone. Medical staff are overwhelmed and 103 have died during the pandemic, among some 33,500 coronavirus fatalities overall. ""It is sad that many of us have died, many of us became sick, and many have resigned or opted to retire early, yet we are still kneeling before the DOH to give us our benefits,"" Robert Mendoza, president of the Alliance of Health Workers, said from the back of a pickup truck. President Rodrigo Duterte gave health and budget ministries 10 days from Aug. 21 to pay health workers, following nurses' threats to resign and unions warning of strikes. read more ""The government promised it will give the benefits today but up to now, it has not. I pity us because we are the ones begging,"" said nurse Nico Oba. Duterte has stood by health minister Duque during repeated calls for his resignation, the latest after state auditors flagged ""deficiencies"" in more than $1 billion in COVID-19 spending. read more Duque on Wednesday told Reuters the government was working on the release of benefits but appealed for more time.

China beats Taiwan to the punch in announcing new vaccine delivery,2783,"BEIJING/TAIPEI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - China beat Taiwan to the punch on Wednesday in announcing the delivery timetable for a highly politicised order of COVID-19 vaccines from BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), saying the first 932,000 shots would arrive on the Chinese-claimed island on Thursday. Taiwan has blamed China for blocking an original order from the German firm earlier this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high profile billionaire founder Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the vaccine. A $350 million deal for 10 million doses was signed in July. They will be donated to the government for distribution. In a brief report shortly before Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung begun his daily news briefing in Taipei, China's official Xinhua news agency said the vaccines would leave Luxembourg on Wednesday and were expected to arrive in Taiwan on Thursday morning. It noted the vaccines were being provided by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (600196.SS), which has the right to sell the shots on BioNTech's behalf in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. A second delivery of around 910,000 doses would arrive next week, Xinhua added. The vaccines are made in Germany and are coming from there. Chen told reporters the aircraft had already departed and would arrive early morning on Thursday, though he offered no comment on Xinhua making the announcement before Taiwan's government could. Gou's office said he would be represented at the airport by his cousin Sophie Chang, who is also the wife of TSMC's founder Morris Chang. Gou is currently in quarantine after returning from a trip to Europe. The BioNTech drama has dominated headlines in Taiwan, especially after Gou got involved. Taiwan is getting the shots, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. read more While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order.

"Euro zone Aug factory growth strong - as were price rises, PMI shows",2041,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth remained strong in August but supply chain issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic continued to constrain supplies of the raw materials factories need, driving up prices, a survey showed on Wednesday. The easing of restrictions imposed to stop the coronavirus from spreading has driven demand but many firms have reported logistical troubles, product shortages and a labour crunch. IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate. An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, fell from July's 61.1 to 59.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth. ""Euro zone manufacturers reported another month of buoyant production in August, continuing the growth spurt into its 14th successive month,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""The overriding issue was again a lack of components, however, with suppliers either unable to produce enough parts or facing a lack of shipping capacity to meet logistics demand."" An ongoing shortage of materials and a lack of transport availability meant sellers of the goods factories need were again able to ramp up their charges. The input prices index thus remained high at 87.0, although shy of July's record 89.2. As a result, factories again sharply increased the prices they charge. Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth. read more The ECB wants inflation at 2% but prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 3.0% in August, fuelled by unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods.

Britney Spears' lawyer wants father out immediately as conservator,2387,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The father of Britney Spears should step down immediately and without conditions from his role as conservator of her estate, the singer's lawyer said in court documents.

South Korea in eleventh-hour talks to head off strike by health workers,2640,"SEOUL, Sept 1 (Reuters) - South Korean government officials were in last-ditch efforts on Wednesday to stave off a strike by health workers who say they are exhausted from battling waves of COVID-19 outbreaks and need more personnel and better work conditions. The Korean Health and Medical Worker's Union has warned some of its 80,000 members, including nurses, medical engineers, pharmacists and administrative hospital staff, would begin striking from Thursday if demands are not met. Lee Ki-il, South Korea's deputy minister of health care policy, said at least 104 hospitals out of around 3,400 across the country are set to participate in the strike. ""Most of the 104 hospitals are large major hospitals and designated to treat infectious diseases."" The union said it has not put a timeline on how long the strike might go on. The government and the union have previously met for talks 12 times since May, including a 14-hour marathon session on Monday, but have not been able to find common ground. The union argues its workers are often working double or triple shifts and need better pay and working hours. It is also seeking higher rates of staffing, the establishment of more public hospitals and the introduction of a recommended nurse to patient ratio. The United States has a recommended ratio of 1:5 and Japan has 1:7 while South Korea has none. For its part, the government has said it plans to expand funding for public medicine but demands such as establishing more hospitals could be too expensive and need agreements of many parties on many levels. It was not immediately clear how crippling the strike could be. Government officials say only a certain percentage of workers are expected to join and essential services such as emergency rooms, surgeries and dialysis will still operate. South Korea reported 2,025 new COVID-19 cases for Tuesday, not far off a record daily high marked earlier last month. Early success in mitigating outbreaks has given way to strains on the hospital system as the Delta variant spreads, though the country's mortality rate remains relatively low at 0.9%. Around 57.0% of South Korea's population of 52 million population has been given one dose of a vaccine, while 30.7% have been fully vaccinated.

Pollution likely to cut 9 years of life expectancy of 40% of Indians,2227,"NEW DELHI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Air pollution is likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40% of Indians by more than nine years, according to a report released by a U.S. research group on Wednesday. More than 480 million people living in the vast swathes of central, eastern and northern India, including the capital, New Delhi, endure significantly high pollution levels, said the report prepared by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). ""Alarmingly, India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time,"" the EPIC report said. For example, air quality has significantly worsened in the western state of Maharashtra and the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it said. Lauding India's National Clean Air Program (NCAP), launched in 2019 to rein in dangerous pollution levels, the EPIC report said ""achieving and sustaining"" the NCAP goals would raise the country's overall life expectancy by 1.7 years and that of New Delhi 3.1 years. The NCAP aims to reduce pollution in the 102 worst-affected cities by 20%-30% by 2024 by ensuring cuts in industrial emissions and vehicular exhaust, introducing stringent rules for transport fuels and biomass burning and reduce dust pollution. It will also entail better monitoring systems. New Delhi was the world's most polluted capital for the third straight year in 2020, according to IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5. Last year, New Delhi's 20 million residents, who breathed some of the cleanest air on record in the summer because of coronavirus lockdown curbs, battled toxic air in winter following a sharp increase in farm residue burning in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana. According to the EPIC's findings, neighbouring Bangladesh could raise average life expectancy by 5.4 years if the country improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organization. To arrive at the life expectancy number, EPIC compared the health of people exposed to different levels of long-term air pollution and applied the results to various places in India and elsewhere.

Walmart says ready to administer millions of COVID-19 vaccine boosters,1331,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) on Tuesday became the latest U.S. retailer to say that it is ready to administer millions of COVID-19 booster vaccine doses this fall if U.S. health officials endorse such a shot to improve fading immunity against the coronavirus. Rivals CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Kroger Co (KR.N) earlier this month had announced plans to make booster shots available at their stores, pending regulatory guidance. read more U.S. health regulators have authorized a third dose of the vaccines made by Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE)as well as Moderna (MRNA.O) for those with weak immune systems, and the government has said it plans to make booster doses available to more Americans in September. The need for boosters, however, has not yet been recommended by health regulators. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said it may be difficult to determine at this point whether immunity from prior vaccination is waning over time or if the vaccines are just less able to prevent infection by the highly-transmissible Delta variant. read more Walmart, which runs one of the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, and its Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering the third dose to immunocompromised individuals.

Idaho reactivates National Guard to help with rising coronavirus cases,1903,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Idaho Governor Brad Little said on Tuesday he was reactivating the National Guard and directing up to 370 additional people to help hospitals as they were overwhelmed with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. There were only four intensive care unit beds available Tuesday in the entire state, out of nearly 400, the governor said in a statement. ""Where hospitals have converted other spaces to be used as contingency ICU beds, those are filling up too,"" Governor Little said. Up to 150 guardsmen will support short-staffed medical facilities and will be tasked with logistical support such as screenings, lab work, and other duties, according to details of the plans to reactivate the National Guard. An additional 200 medical and administrative personnel will be available to Idaho through a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. A 20-person Department of Defense medical response team will be deployed to North Idaho, where vaccination rates are among the lowest in the state, the governor said. ""We are dangerously close to activating statewide crisis standards of care – a historic step that means Idahoans in need of healthcare could receive a lesser standard of care or may be turned away altogether"", he added. The U.S. state of Idaho has thus far seen 221,389 cases of COVID-19 and recorded over 2,300 deaths from the coronavirus, according to the website of the Idaho Department of Health. There were 1,226 new coronavirus cases recorded on Tuesday. Over 820,000 people in the state have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine while over 733,000 people are fully vaccinated, according to government data.

"Brazilian viper venom may become tool in fight against COVID, study shows",2108,"SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian researchers have found that a molecule in the venom of a type of snake inhibited coronavirus reproduction in monkey cells, a possible first step toward a drug to combat the virus causing COVID-19. A study published in the scientific journal Molecules this month found that the molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the virus's ability to multiply in monkey cells by 75%. ""We were able to show this component of snake venom was able to inhibit a very important protein from the virus,"" said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study. The molecule is a peptide, or chain of amino acids, that can connect to an enzyme of the coronavirus called PLPro, which is vital to reproduction of the virus, without hurting other cells. A jararacussu snake, whose venom is used in a study against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is seen at Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil August 27, 2021. Picture taken August 27, 2021. REUTERS/Carla Carniel Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesized in the laboratory, Guido said in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary. ""We're wary about people going out to hunt the jararacussu around Brazil, thinking they're going to save the world ... That's not it!"" said Giuseppe Puorto, a herpetologist running the Butantan Institute's biological collection in Sao Paulo. ""It's not the venom itself that will cure the coronavirus."" Researchers will next evaluate the efficiency of different doses of the molecule and whether it is able to prevent the virus from entering cells in the first place, according to a statement from the State University of Sao Paulo (Unesp), which was also involved in the research. They hope to test the substance in human cells but gave no timeline. The jararacussu is one of the largest snakes in Brazil, measuring up to 6 feet (2 meters) long.

"Judge vets potential Theranos jurors, as COVID-19 looms over start of Holmes trial",4079,"SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug 31 (Reuters) - As Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes' highly anticipated fraud trial began on Tuesday, the judge overseeing the case quizzed potential jurors about whether they could be fair considering the intense media coverage about the entrepreneur, who has long been a subject of fascination in Silicon Valley. Dozens of prospective jurors crowded into a small federal courtroom in San Jose, California, wearing masks and sitting one seat apart to protect against COVID-19. Holmes, 37, has pleaded not guilty to defrauding Theranos investors and patients by falsely claiming that the now-defunct blood testing company had developed technology to run a wide range of tests on a single drop of blood. The meteoric rise and spectacular fall of Theranos turned Holmes from a young billionaire into a defendant who could face years in prison if convicted. When asked on Tuesday if they had been exposed to media coverage of the case, more than a third of the potential jurors raised their hands. At least one had read ""Bad Blood,"" Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou's best-selling book about the Theranos saga. The book chronicles the emergence of the company Holmes started at age 19, concluding that she was a ""manipulator"" whose ""moral compass was badly askew."" Jury pool members who were questioned about that exposure in court largely said it would not affect their ability to be impartial, though several were excused. Known for dressing in a Steve Jobs-style black turtleneck, a masked Holmes wore a black suit in court on Tuesday. The pandemic loomed over the proceedings, with U.S. District Judge Edward Davila assuring jurors about the quality of air filtration in the courtroom. Davila excused nine jurors who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, saying jury service would be a hardship for them. ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes leaves after a hearing at a federal court in San Jose, California, July 17, U.S., 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo The trial is expected to last several months, and Holmes' lawyers have said she may make the unusual move of taking the stand in her own defense, opening herself up to cross-examination by prosecutors. Court papers submitted more than 18 months ago and unsealed late on Friday revealed that Holmes had accused former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani of psychological and sexual abuse. Holmes' lawyers said her ""deference"" to Balwani led her to believe allegedly false statements about parts of Theranos that he controlled, including a claim about a partnership with drugstore chain Walgreens (WBA.O). Holmes was 18 years old when she met Balwani, who is 20 years her senior, and started living with him around three years later, according to Carreyrou's book. Balwani denied allegations of abuse in a 2019 court filing. He is scheduled to be tried separately on fraud charges. Lawyers for Holmes and Balwani did not return requests for comment on Monday. When asked by the judge on Tuesday whether they or someone they knew had experienced domestic violence, five potential jurors raised their hands. One juror said her ex-husband had been abusive toward her. Another, who was dismissed, said his wife was a victim of domestic abuse in a prior relationship. ""Emotionally she is very scarred from it,"" he said, responding to questions from the judge. ""I feel bad for her because it's something she can't shake."" No jurors raised their hand when asked if they knew anyone they thought had been falsely accused of abuse. Christina Marinakis, a jury consultant with litigation consultant IMS, said both sides have likely combed through potential jurors' social media posts for their views about abuse. Marinakis said jurors may be reluctant to admit to a tendency to view a claim of abuse as an ""excuse"" for Holmes' conduct, she added. ""They may fear they are going to be looked at as misogynists,"" she said. Jury selection is scheduled to continue on Wednesday morning, with opening arguments next Tuesday.

Japan's Aug factory activity growth slows on resurgence of COVID-19 - PMI,1883,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Japan's factory activity expanded at a slower rate in August as a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Asia disrupted supply chains across the region, sinking overseas orders into contraction for the first time in seven months. Manufacturers withstood the pandemic's hit in part thanks to their positive outlook for the coming twelve months, even as the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant is pushing countries in Asia-Pacific back into lockdown mode. The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in August eased to 52.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 53.0 in the previous month, and up slightly from a 52.4 flash reading. ""A sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in South East Asia was among the key factors listed by Japanese manufacturers for the easing in demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey. ""Severe supply chain disruption partly caused by pandemic restrictions and raw material shortages remained a dampener on production and orders."" The PMI survey showed that overall new orders expanded at their slowest pace since January, while new export orders posted their first contraction since that month. Overall output saw a rise, but its pace eased from the prior month as the intensifying health crisis and a lack of raw materials weighed on production. The survey also showed output for intermediate goods grew at their fastest pace in four-and-a-half years, offsetting weaker demand for investment and consumer products. Input prices maintained a sustained increase, while companies' expectations for the year ahead remained firm, though they eased to the softest since January. ""Though still optimistic, Japanese goods producers were wary of the continued impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruption,"" said Bhatti. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Novartis signs deal with Britain's NHS for new cholesterol drug Leqvio,1944,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Novartis AG (NOVN.S) said on Wednesday it had agreed a deal with Britain's healthcare service provider for use of the drugmaker's new anti-cholesterol drug Leqvio, after the country's healthcare cost agency NICE approved the medicine. The agreement, whose value was not disclosed, will help with wide access to the Swiss drugmaker's medicine through Britain's National Health Service (NHS) for people at risk of heart disease and for whom conventional treatment has not worked. The deal, which builds on a pact signed in 2020, is a win for Novartis after U.S. authorities last year declined to approve the drug, which the drugmaker bought in 2019 for nearly $10 billion and expects to be a top seller. About 300,000 patients at high risk of a second cardiovascular incident are expected to be treated with the medicine over three years, Novartis said on Wednesday. Heart disease is a big killer in Britain and the NHS has made fighting cardiovascular disorders one of its long-term priorities. Britain's NICE, which determines if medicines should be used in the NHS, has recommended Leqvio's use and eligible individuals will be identified via NHS's network. Leqvio, whose chemical generic name is inclisiran, is a twice-yearly injection that targets ""bad cholesterol,"" a culprit behind heart attacks and strokes, and has been approved in Europe. It is an add-on therapy for those patients whose cholesterol levels do not respond adequately to statins. ""Having faster and broader access to a medicine like inclisiran ... is a hugely positive milestone in patient care,"" said Kausik Ray, a professor of public health at Imperial College London and consultant at the imperial college NHS Trust. Around 7.6 million Britons have heart and circulatory diseases, which account for about a quarter of all deaths annually in the country, according to the British Heart Foundation.

New York prosecutors charge pair with selling fake COVID-19 vaccine cards,2402,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 31 (Reuters) - Two women have been charged with selling forged COVID-19 vaccination cards through an Instagram account and to enter the names of customers into New York state's immunization database, prosecutors said on Tuesday. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. charged Jasmine Clifford, 31 of Lyndhurst, New Jersey, and Nadayza Barkley, 27, of Bellport, New York, with offering a false instrument, which is a felony, and misdemeanor conspiracy. Barkley's lawyer Glenn Hardy said his client maintains her innocence and believes she will be vindicated after a full investigation. An attorney for Clifford was not immediately available for comment. Vance also charged 13 hospital, nursing home and medical and nursing school workers with possession of a forged instrument, accusing them of purchasing cards from Clifford. Barkley is accused of entering some of their names in the database. Demand for counterfeit COVID-19 vaccination cards has increased in recent months as more state and local governments, schools and businesses require employees and students to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Vaccines are widely available and free of charge in the United States, where the inoculation rate lags other developed countries as millions choose not to be vaccinated. read more Vance said social media companies such as Facebook (FB.O), which owns Instagram, needs to prevent fraud on their websites. ""The stakes are too high to tackle fake vaccination cards with whack-a-mole prosecutions,"" he said. ""Making, selling, and purchasing forged vaccination cards are serious crimes with serious public safety consequences."" Vance said Clifford, a self-described entrepreneur with several online businesses, began advertising fake COVID-19 vaccination cards on her Instagram account, @AntiVaxMomma, in May. She sold about 250 cards for $200 a piece on the social media site, Vance said. For an additional $250 fee, Barkley, who works at a medical clinic in New York, would enter the buyer's name into the state's database as having received COVID-19 vaccinations. She fraudulently entered at least 10 names, he said."
Detroit highlights the tension over COVID vaccine mandates,3388,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 26 story corrects to remove reference to number of workers represented by unions in paragraph 14. The error occurred in a previous version as well) Public support for stronger measures to require COVID vaccinations is strong, according to a new Reuters/IPSOS poll, but for Detroit automakers the debate over vaccination policy is far from over. General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Thursday it has required its U.S. salaried employees to report whether they have received COVID-19 shots, the first such action by one of Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers. GM said the information will help ""determine when GM should relax or strengthen certain COVID-19 safety protocols as recommended by the CDC and OSHA, such as mask wearing, physical distancing and facility occupancy rates,"" referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Separately, United Auto Workers President Ray Curry on Thursday expressed support for only voluntary measures to encourage vaccination or survey workers' vaccination status. The UAW, with nearly 400,000 members, represents U.S. factory workers at GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Stellantis NV (STLA.MI) as well as workers at other U.S. manufacturers, colleges, government agencies and casinos. ""We would be open to discussion about voluntary efforts,"" Curry said during a videoconference on Thursday. Steps such as GM's plan to gather information about employees' vaccination status would be subject to bargaining before they could be applied to UAW workers, Curry said. Such data collection would raise medical privacy concerns, he said. Likewise, Curry said the UAW would expect companies to negotiate before following the example of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which said it will charge unvaccinated employees an extra $200 a month for company health coverage. ""We have not had an employer reach out to discuss with us"" a vaccine mandate or a penalty for workers who are not vaccinated, Curry said. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds support for employer vaccination requirements. The poll found that 60% of adults support employers who require people to show a proof of vaccination before allowing them to return to the office, while 34% oppose vaccine requirements. The poll, conducted from Aug. 13 to 19, gathered responses from 4,427 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points. About two-thirds of American adults support mask requirements in restaurants, airplanes, gyms and the workplace, while less than one-third oppose them, the poll found. Detroit automakers have reinstated masking requirements in their factories as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has spread. But they have so far not proposed broad measures to require vaccinations. GM has about 48,000 salaried workers in the United States, as per its annual regulatory filing. ""GM earlier this month implemented an expanded vaccination status reporting process that was mandatory for all U.S. salaried employees. We gathered this information via a confidential online tool,"" the company said in a statement. Ford is requiring salaried staff who travel internationally to get vaccinated. ""We are currently assessing whether we need to expand the requirement,"" the company said in a statement. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
3M loses bid to dodge October bellwether trial in earplug mega MDL,3773,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - An upcoming bellwether case over claims that 3M Co's Combat Arms earplugs were defective and led to hearing damage for U.S. military personnel who used them can go to trial as scheduled next month, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers in Pensacola, Florida on Monday denied 3M's motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by Michelle Blum, who served in the U.S. Army Reserves, National Guard and Army between 1989 and 2009, rejecting the company's arguments that her claims were time-barred. Blum's case is set to go to trial on Oct. 18, following another bellwether trial set for Sept. 20. ""We look forward to the next bellwether trial next month, and plan to hold 3M fully accountable for the damage they have caused to those who served our nation,"" plaintiffs' lawyers Bryan Aylstock of Aylstock, Witkin, Kreis & Overholtz; Shelley Hutson of Clark, Love & Hutson; and Christopher Seeger of Seeger Weiss said in a joint statement. ""We are confident in our case and are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves in all upcoming trials,"" 3M spokesperson Fanna Haile-Selassie said in an email. The company is represented by lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis including Hariklia Karis, Nick Wasdin and Mark Nomellini. 3M is facing more than 240,000 claims over the earplugs, known as Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2, which were standard issue for many U.S. military service members between 2003 and 2015. The vast majority of those are consolidated before Rodgers in the largest multidistrict litigation in history. Three bellwether trials have already been held, one of which resulted in a $7.1 million verdict for three plaintiffs and another in a $1.7 million verdict for a single plaintiff, though the jury found 3M only 62% liable in the latter case. 3M was cleared of liability in the third. In moving for summary judgment against Blum, 3M argued that many of her claims, brought under New York law, were barred by the state's three- or four-year limitation periods because she sustained hearing damage in 2009 or earlier but did not bring her claims until 2019. Rodgers, however, wrote that 3M could not rely on the statute of limitations because it was up to the jury to decide whether the company had concealed defects in the earplugs, preventing Blum from bringing timely claims. The judge said there was ""ample record evidence from which a jury could find that defendants affirmatively misrepresented information"" about the earplugs to the military and to soldiers. The ruling came after Rodgers on Friday scheduled five further bellwether trials in November and December, each involving a single plaintiff. Four will be tried by other judges in Rodgers' district, the Northern District of Florida, and a fifth will be tried in Pensacola by a judge from the Northern District of Alabama. Rodgers is presiding over the September and October bellwether trials, as well as another bellwether set for January involving three plaintiffs. The case is In re 3M Combat Arms Earplug Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, No. 19-md-2885.

Indonesia probes suspected data breach on COVID-19 app,1672,"JAKARTA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Indonesia is investigating a suspected security flaw in a COVID-19 test-and-trace app that left exposed personal information and the health status of 1.3 million people, a health ministry official said on Tuesday. Researchers from encryption provider vpnMentor said personal information in the Indonesia Health Alert Card (eHAC) app, often required to be used by travellers, was accessible ""due to the lack of protocols put in place by the app's developers."" Anas Ma'ruf, a health ministry official overseeing data, said the government was looking into the potential breach, but said the potential flaw was in an earlier version of the app, which has not been used since July. ""The eHAC from the old version is different from the eHAC system that is a part of the new app,"" he said. ""Right now, we're investigating this suspected breach"". The eHAC system is now part of the Peduli Lindungi (Care Protect) app, which the government has promoted for various tracing purposes, including entry at malls. Anas urged people to delete the old app and said the breach might have originated from a partner, without elaborating. He said the current eHAC system was now managed by the government and its safety was ""guaranteed"". VpnMentor researchers said the flaw could expose people to phishing or hacking, as well as discourage people from using a COVID-19 tracing app. Experts say such data breaches point to Indonesia's weak cyber security infrastructure. In May, authorities also launched an investigation into an alleged breach of social security data from the country's state insurer. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Explainer: Why and how China is drastically limiting online gaming for under 18s,3622,"BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China on Monday introduced new rules that limit the amount of time under-18s can spend on video games to three hours a week, a move it said was necessary to combat gaming addiction. The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. WHY IS CHINA CONCERNED ABOUT GAMING ADDICTION? Authorities in China, the world's largest video games market, have worried for years about addiction to gaming and the internet among young people, setting up clinics which combine therapy and military drills for those with so-called ""gaming disorders"". Rising rates of nearsightedness were also cited as a concern in 2018. The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the regulator which approves video game titles, said on Monday the new rules were a response to growing concern that games affected the physical and mental health of children. About 62.5% of Chinese minors often play games online, and 13.2% of underage mobile game users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on weekdays, according to state media. Chinese regulators have also targeted the private tutoring industry and what they see as celebrity worship in recent weeks, citing the need to ensure the wellbeing of children. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR? In 2017, Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said it would limit play time for some young users of its flagship mobile game ""Honor of Kings"", a response to complaints from parents and teachers that children were becoming addicted. A boy plays a game on a phone on a street in Shanghai, China August 31, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song A year later, citing concerns over growing rates of myopia, Beijing said it was looking at potential measures to restrict game play by children and suspended video game approvals for nine months. In 2019, it passed laws limiting minors to less than 1.5 hours of online games on weekdays and three hours on weekends, with no game playing allowed between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. It also limited how much minors could spend on virtual gaming items each month, with maximum amounts ranging from $28 to $57, depending on the age. In addition, minors were required to use their real names and national identification numbers when they logged on to play and companies like Tencent and NetEase (9999.HK), set up systems to identify minors. In July, Tencent rolled out a facial recognition function dubbed ""midnight patrol"" that parents can switch on to prevent children from using adult logins to get around the government curfew. WHAT ARE THE NEW CURBS AND HOW WILL CHINA ENFORCE THEM? The new restrictions forbid children under 18 to play online games from Monday through Thursday, effective Sept. 1. They can only play for one hour, between 8 and 9 p.m., on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Online gaming companies must ensure they have put real name verification systems in place, and all titles will eventually need to be connected to an anti-addiction system being set up by the NPPA. NPPA told state news agency Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections of online gaming companies to ensure time limits were put in place. The regulator will also step up measures to punish gaming firms that violate the rules and has increased penalties given after inspections, noting that more than 10,000 gaming titles were reviewed last year. It noted minors could still use their parents' accounts to bypass the restrictions and said parents and schools also need to step up supervision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Pennsylvania governor issues mask mandate for schools, child care facilities",1827,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Tuesday issued a mask mandate for all K-12 school and child care facilities to protect against the spread of COVID-19, three weeks after the Democrat said he would leave the decision to individual districts. The order, which goes into effect Sept. 7, comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the highly-contagious Delta variant of the virus. Since July, Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 case load has increased from less than 300 a day to more than 3,000 a day, according to the state's health department. “With case counts increasing, the situation has reached the point that we need to take this action to protect our children, teachers and staff. The science is clear,"" the state's acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said in a statement. The decision comes as millions of public education students head back to schools across the United States. School districts, state education agencies and governors across the nation are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements. In South Carolina, for example, the state's supreme court heard arguments on Tuesday in two cases involving mask mandates in city of Columbia schools. The order in Pennsylvania requires students, teachers and staff to wear masks in all public and private K-12 schools. The order also applies to child care providers and early learning programs. The order does not apply to school sports or outdoor activities. In early August, Wolf said he intended to leave the decision to require masks in schools up to individual districts. ""Unfortunately, an aggressive nationwide campaign is spreading misinformation about mask-wearing and pressuring and intimidating school districts to reject mask policies that will keep kids safe and in school,"" he said.

'Most stressful time of my career': Law deans reflect on pandemic,3501,"(Reuters) - Law school deans have lost plenty of sleep during the pandemic, according to a newly published survey in which top law school administrators reported high levels of COVID-related stress. It wasn’t just the health of their law school communities that kept deans up at night during the early months of the pandemic. They were also worried about potential budget shortfalls and the learning experience for students who abruptly traded in-person courses for online classes, according to the survey, which was published last week. It was conducted in November by University of Toledo Law Dean Benjamin Barros and 2021 Toledo law graduate Cameron Morrissey, and generated responses from 51 deans – or about a quarter of those who lead American Bar Association-accredited law schools. “I’ve had some stressful days as a dean,” Barros said in an interview with Reuters. “But that April, May, June period early in the pandemic was hands down the most stressful time of my career.” In addition to quickly figuring out how to move his school online, Barros said he was bracing for a 20% budget cut from the state because Ohio officials were unsure of how the pandemic would impact tax revenue. The state funding reduction ended up being less than anticipated, but the scramble to quickly identify costs savings was unnerving, he said. Barros surveyed his colleagues in November of 2020, in part to create a historical record of how the pandemic was felt across legal education. The resulting article, titled, “A Survey of Law School Deans On the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” appears in the latest edition of the University of Toledo Law Review. The survey looks to be the first to document that law deans at some public schools felt political pressure to hold classes in-person. Only eight of the responding deans indicated a strong degree of political pressure to teach in person, the survey found, but all eight were from public law schools. The survey results were anonymous and did not disclose where the deans who reported political pressure were located. All but four responding deans said their schools went remote in the spring of 2020. For the fall 2020 semester, 63% of courses were given online, on average. The deans generally reported low rates of COVID-19 within their law school communities. When asked what percentage of students and staff had tested positive for the virus in the first nine months of the pandemic, the average response was 3% among students and less than 2% among staff and faculty. But the mental well-being of both students and faculty emerged as a major source of concern among the deans, the survey found. On a scale of 0 to 7, all but six rated the “impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental wellbeing of your students” as a four or higher. The results were similar when asked about the mental wellness of faculty and staff. When asked to report the extent to which the pandemic had negatively impacted their own stress level, all but 10 of the responding deans responded with a four or higher. Barros noted that he conducted the survey at a time when vaccines were about to become widely available and the end of the pandemic seemed to be on the horizon. But the rise of the Delta variant has meant deans are still grappling with COVID-19. “All of us were hoping we’d be past this right now, and we aren’t,” he said.

Eagle escapes Par's patent claims over proposed Vasostrict generic,3870,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc's proposed generic of Endo International subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical Inc's best-selling drug doesn't infringe Par's patents, a Delaware federal court ruled Tuesday. Eagle's generic doesn't infringe patents related to Par's Vasostrict, which is used to treat shock in patients whose blood vessels suddenly relax, because it has a lower pH than the drug composition covered by Par's patents, U.S. District Judge Colm Connolly said following a three-day bench trial in July. Eagle's CEO Scott Tarriff said in an email that the company was ""very pleased"" with the decision, which is ""a significant step towards bringing our vasopressin product to the market."" Tarriff said he anticipated that Eagle would have final approval for the generic in time to launch it this year. Eagle's attorneys David Moore and Bindu Palapura of Potter Anderson & Corroon and Bryan Hales and Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Endo or Par's attorneys Brian Farnan of Farnan and Martin Black of Dechert. Dublin-based Endo sold over $785 million worth of Vasostrict last fiscal year, making it the company's highest-selling drug, according to a company report. Par sued Eagle in 2018 after the Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based company filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a generic version of Vasostrict, alleging the generic would infringe its patents related to the drug. Eagle said it didn't infringe because its formulation of the drug's active ingredient, vasopressin, has a pH value below the range covered by Par's patents. During a study, a batch of Eagle's generic had a pH level in Par's patented range, but Connolly said Eagle altered its manufacturing process to ""assure tighter control of pH"" after the test result, and that none of the test results for batches created after this change approached the patented pH range. Par said the pH of Eagle's generic tends to drift upwards and that its proposal outlines a drug that is just below the patented range, making it likely to infringe. ""But the data do not establish that Eagle's ANDA product has the 'drift problem' Par claims,"" Connolly said in his Tuesday ruling. The measurements for Eagle's product didn't show a ""steady and inevitable creep"" toward higher pH values, but ""minor fluctuations"" with no ""discernible trend,"" Connolly said. Connolly also said Par mischaracterized the high end of Eagle's proposed pH range. Eagle asserted in its ANDA that its drug would have a lower pH value than outlined in Par's patents ""through the entirety of the products' shelf lives,"" and it must comply with its ANDA specifications to receive FDA approval, the court said. ""Accordingly, the ANDA product Eagle is asking the FDA to approve cannot have"" a pH in Par's patented range, and ""therefore a judgment of noninfringement must necessarily ensue,"" Connolly said. Par's infringement case against Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc, which proposed its own generic of Vasostrict and was also part of the July bench trial, is still pending. The case is Par Pharmaceutical Inc v. Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, No. 1:18-cv-00823 For Par: Brian Farnan of Farnan; and Martin Black of Dechert For Eagle: David Moore and Bindu Palapura of Potter Anderson & Corroon; and Bryan Hales and Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis Blake Brittain reports on intellectual property law, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.

"Russian Olympic medallists made to quarantine before meeting Putin, athlete says",1484,"MOSCOW, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Russian Olympic medallists are being made to quarantine for a week after returning from the Tokyo Games so that they can meet President Vladimir Putin, one of the team's athletes said on Tuesday. Russians won 71 medals, including 20 golds, at the Olympics, a result feted as a victory at home despite the country competing without its flag and anthem because of doping sanctions. Putin, 68, had two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, one in March and one in April, according to the Kremlin, but Moscow has continued to take pandemic precautions with regards to his health. Before being vaccinated, Putin spent much of the pandemic running the country from his residence rather than the Kremlin, chairing video conference meetings instead of face-to-face encounters. People who meet him in person have reported being required to quarantine. ""All Olympic champions and medallists have a meeting with the president when they return home,"" gymnast Angelina Melnikova, who won gold in the women's team event and bronze in the all-around and floor exercice, wrote in her Instagram stories. ""The meeting is planned for September 10, and because of COVID, which we are all fed up with, we have to be in quarantine for seven days."" Melnikova said athletes would undergo three COVID tests in the hotel where they will be self-isolating. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"South Africa detects new coronavirus variant, still studying its mutations",2785,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - South African scientists have detected a new coronavirus variant with multiple mutations but are yet to establish whether it is more contagious or able to overcome the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection. The new variant, known as C.1.2, was first detected in May and has now spread to most South African provinces and to seven other countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania, according to research which is yet to be peer-reviewed. It contains many mutations associated in other variants with increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, but they occur in a different mix and scientists are not yet sure how they affect the behaviour of the virus. Laboratory tests are underway to establish how well the variant is neutralised by antibodies. South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, one of only four labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Beta is believed to spread more easily than the original version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and there is evidence vaccines work less well against it, leading some countries to restrict travel to and from South Africa. PANDEMIC 'FAR FROM OVER' Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist and one of the authors of the research on C.1.2, said its emergence tells us ""this pandemic is far from over and that this virus is still exploring ways to potentially get better at infecting us"".

REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo He said people should not be overly alarmed at this stage and that variants with more mutations were bound to emerge further into the pandemic. Genomic sequencing data from South Africa show the C.1.2 variant was still nowhere near displacing the dominant Delta variant in July, the latest month for which a large number of samples was available. In July C.1.2 accounted for 3% of samples versus 1% in June, whereas Delta accounted for 67% in June and 89% in July. Delta is the fastest and fittest variant the world has encountered, and it is upending assumptions about COVID-19 even as nations loosen restrictions and reopen their economies. read more Lessells said C.1.2 may have more immune evasion properties than Delta, based on its pattern of mutations, and that the findings had been flagged to the WHO.

Egypt ramps up local vaccine production with eye on exports,2367,"CAIRO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Egypt is ramping up production of the Sinovac coronavirus vaccine as it aims to become a hub for vaccine exports to Africa and protect its own population of more than 100 million from a fourth wave of infections. The government is preparing new facilities that it says could produce several million vaccine doses daily, and is also in talks with an unspecified European vaccine producer. ""We are currently in discussions with other companies because it is important to us that we diversify our sources, and hopefully soon we will announce our partnership with a European company,"" said Dr Heba Wali, president of the state-run Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA). Wali, speaking at VACSERA's headquarters, said one million doses of the VACSERA-Sinovac jab had already been distributed within Egypt. In recent months, Egypt has also received shipments of vaccines made by Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinovac and Johnson & Johnson. Nearly 7.5 million people in Egypt had received at least one dose of a vaccine, Health Minister Hala Zayed said last week as she announced a push to accelerate jabs. A fourth wave of COVID-19 infections is expected to peak in late September after a lull in infections, according to Zayed. A new VACSERA facility outside Cairo aims to begin production in November and have a capacity of 1 billion vaccines per year. ""We aim to not only be self-sufficient regarding the vaccine, but we hope to export it to our brothers in African countries and the entire region,"" Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in a statement on Monday. Wali said that Egypt's Chinese partners had overseen the local production lines, and she dismissed doubts about the Sinovac shot's efficacy, citing its approval by the World Health Organization. ""However, with the appearance of new strains of the virus, companies always study their vaccines and their effectiveness with these new strains, and if any company confirms that it is ineffective, they will (further) develop their vaccine."" On Tuesday, Egypt reported 263 new cases, bringing its total to 288,162, including 16,727 deaths. Officials and experts say the real number is far higher but not reflected in government figures because of low testing rates and the exclusion of private lab results.

Three hours a week: Play time's over for China's young video gamers,4407,"SHANGHAI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - China has forbidden under-18s from playing video games for more than three hours a week, a stringent social intervention that it said was needed to pull the plug on a growing addiction to what it once described as ""spiritual opium"". The new rules, published on Monday, are part of a major shift by Beijing to strengthen control over its society and key sectors of its economy, including tech, education and property, after years of runaway growth. The restrictions, which apply to any devices including phones, are a body blow to a global gaming industry that caters to tens of millions of young players in the world's most lucrative market. They limit under-18s to playing for one hour a day - 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. - on only Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, according to the Xinhua state news agency. They can also play for an hour, at the same time, on public holidays. The rules from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) regulator coincide with a broader clampdown by Beijing against China's tech giants, such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and Tencent Holdings (0700.HK). The campaign to prevent what state media has described as the ""savage growth"" of some companies has wiped tens of billions of dollars off shares traded at home and abroad. read more ""Teenagers are the future of our motherland,"" Xinhua quoted an unnamed NPPA spokesperson as saying. ""Protecting the physical and mental health of minors is related to the people's vital interests, and relates to the cultivation of the younger generation in the era of national rejuvenation.""

Previously, China had limited the length of time under-18s could play video games to 1.5 hours on any day and three hours on holidays under 2019 rules. The new rules swiftly became one of the most discussed topics on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter. Some users expressed support for the measures while others said they were surprised at how drastic the rules were. ""This is so fierce that I'm utterly speechless,"" said one comment that received over 700 likes. People play online games at an internet cafe in Fuyang, Anhui province, China August 20, 2018.

GAMING SHARES ZAPPED The Chinese games market will generate an estimated $45.6 billion of revenue in 2021, ahead of the United States, according to analytics firm Newzoo. The crackdown reverberated around the world. Shares in Amsterdam-listed tech investment company Prosus (PRX.AS), which holds a 29% stake in Chinese social media and video games group Tencent, were down 1.45%, while European online video gaming stocks Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) and Embracer Group (EMBRACb.ST) each fell over 2%. Shares of Chinese gaming stocks slid in pre-market trading in the United States with NetEase falling over 6% and mobile game publisher Bilibili dropping 3%. About 62.5% of Chinese minors often play games online, and 13.2% of underage mobile game users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on working days, according to state media. Gaming companies have been on edge in recent weeks as state media criticised gaming addiction among young people, signalling a regulatory crackdown. A state media outlet described online games as ""spiritual opium"" this month and cited Tencent's ""Honor of Kings"" in an article that called for more curbs on the industry, battering shares in the world's largest gaming firm by revenue. Tencent later announced new measures to reduce the time and money children spend on games, starting with Honor of Kings. Its president also said it was working with regulators to explore ways in which the total amount of time minors spent on gaming could be capped across all titles in the industry. The NPPA regulator told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems. It also said that parents and teachers played key roles in curbing gaming addiction. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The causation problem in robotically assisted surgical device litigation,9239,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 31, 2021 - Robotically assisted surgical devices (RASD) are one type of computer-assisted surgical systems. RASD have become popularized in recent years and are now commonly used by health practitioners to perform a variety of different surgical procedures. The precision and minimal invasiveness offered by these devices make them attractive to health practitioners and patients, but like all products, RASDs are not flawless and generally not regulated by any singular government agency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared RASDs for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures in general surgery, cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, thoracic and urologic. The FDA does not supervise or credential physician training, however. That role is assumed by manufacturers, physicians, and health care facilities. Some professional societies and specialty board certification organizations have developed and support training for RASD specialty physicians. Specialty boards also maintain RASD specialty physician certification status. RASDs have been the subject of increased litigation due to alleged defects in the manufacturing or design, as well as the failure by health care facilities and practitioners to properly maintain and operate the devices. A variety of causes of action are available to plaintiffs in these matters, including strict products liability, negligence, corporate negligence, medical malpractice, and breach of warranty. A common element of each cause of action applicable to RASD litigation is causation, and a trend in RASD litigation is the difficulty plaintiffs experience in establishing causation. Understanding the various causes of action applicable to RASD litigation and the nature of the causation problem is critical to parties prosecuting and defending these matters. The element of causation, linking the wrongdoing of a defendant to the harm incurred by the plaintiff, is an essential element to every RASD cause of action. In fact, the causation element is the most frequently contested issue at the summary judgment stage in RASD case law. Causation, in broad terms, refers to two critical and related components: actual cause and proximate cause. Actual cause is the simpler concept that merely connects the injury to the cause-in-fact; e.g., a scalpel nicked tissue, causing injury. Proximate causation is the more difficult aspect to establish, as it is the primary cause of injury: e.g., what caused the scalpel to nick the tissue? To establish causation, a plaintiff generally must prove that the defect, design, warning, maintenance or use of the robotic device proximately caused the injury. The failure of a plaintiff to establish causation is fatal to their cause of action. Although causation is generally held to be a question of fact appropriate for a jury to determine, defendants have effectively established the lack of causation as grounds for summary judgment. Certain key issues have been addressed by courts in the struggle of litigants to establish or eliminate the causation element. Causation involving complex medical devices has been most typically established through the use of expert witnesses. Where a jury is expected to consider complex medical or scientific issues beyond the scope of the common person's knowledge, expert testimony is favored and the lack of expert testimony can be fatal to a plaintiff's causation requirement. In addition to it being proffered at the trial stage, plaintiffs often present expert testimony at the summary judgment stage to overcome defensive arguments regarding the lack of causation. In Mraceck v. Bryn Mawr Hosp., a 2010 case in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the plaintiff filed a strict products liability lawsuit arising from an RASD prostatectomy surgery. Plaintiff alleged the RASD malfunctioned and displayed an ""error"" screen, which the surgery team was unable to resolve. The surgeon opted to finish surgery without the RASD. Shortly after surgery, plaintiff began experiencing symptoms, which he attributed to the malfunction of the RASD. The device manufacturer defendant sought summary judgment, arguing the plaintiff failed to submit expert testimony and could not establish the RASD caused his injuries. Summary judgment was granted and affirmed at the appellate level because the plaintiff had not created an issue of fact for a jury to resolve regarding the causal link between his injuries and the RASD. While expert testimony may not be required in all RASD cases, plaintiffs opting to proceed without expert testimony are ideal summary judgment targets for defendants on the causation issue. Because it is difficult to prove a defect and causation in RASD cases, plaintiffs try to employ the res ipsa loquitur theory. Under res ipsa loquitur, an inference that the defendant was negligent is created if the plaintiff can establish: (1) the product was under the exclusive control of the defendant; (2) the plaintiff did not contribute to the incident; and (3) the incident resulting in the injury does not normally occur without negligence on the part of the party in control of the product. Res ipsa loquitur has been disfavored in RASD cases. In Brown v. Griffin, a 2016 Kentucky Court of Appeals case, the appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of a surgeon in a medical malpractice action arising from an RASD hysterectomy. The plaintiff argued res ipsa loquitur should apply because the surgeon testified about his relative inexperience with the RASD, from which she argued a jury could infer the surgeon's ""newness"" in the use of RASD contributed to her injury. The trial and appellate courts rejected this argument, holding jurors do not have general knowledge sufficient to understand the complex nature of RASD surgeries, complications, and mechanisms by which injury or complications occur. A causation issue arises in these cases where certain aspects of a procedure were performed using an RASD and while certain aspects were performed without using an RASD. The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the RASD component of surgery caused injury as opposed to the non-RASD aspect. In Mohler v. St. Luke's Medical Center, LP, a 2008 Arizona Court of Appeals case, the plaintiff underwent a laparoscopic surgery at the defendant's medical center. The attending surgeon performed part of the surgery using a RASD and the other part without. Plaintiff's small intestine was perforated during surgery. In his lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged the medical center negligently failed to ensure the surgeon was properly credentialed to operate the RASD, causing his injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment, finding the plaintiff was unable to establish the failure to ensure credentialing or even the uses of RASD caused his injuries. The Court of Appeals disagreed and found that issues of fact existed for a jury to decide; namely, whether the perforation occurred during the use of the RASD. While RASDs are becoming more common in the practice of health care, it cannot be said that layperson knowledge of these devices has increased proportionally. Because the use of these devices remains heavily specialized, courts will continue to defer to expert testimony and strict causation requirements without allowing causation inferences or more relaxed proof requirements available in more commonplace cases. Counsel on both sides of litigation should expect causation to continue to be the primary point of contention in RASD cases. Opinions expressed are those of the author.

"Italy reports 75 coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, 5,498 new cases",940,"ROME, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Italy reported 75 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday, up from 53 the previous day, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 5,498 from 4,257, the health ministry said. A total of 129,221 deaths linked to COVID-19 have been registered in Italy since its outbreak emerged in February last year. That is the second-highest tally in Europe behind Britain and the eighth-highest globally. Italy has reported 4.54 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 4,252 on Tuesday, down from 4,264 a day earlier. There were 49 new admissions to intensive care units, decreasing from 50 on Monday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 544 from a previous 548. Some 307,643 tests for COVID-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 109,803, the health ministry said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Two top vaccine regulators to leave U.S. FDA,1139,"NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Two of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's top vaccine regulators plan to leave the agency in the next several months, the FDA said on Tuesday. The FDA is ""confident in the expertise and ability of our staff to continue our critical public health work, including evaluating COVID-19 vaccines,"" spokesperson Stephanie Caccomo said in an emailed statement. Dr. Marion Gruber, director of the FDA's Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR), plans to retire on Oct. 31, according to a memo from Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). OVRR is part of CBER. Gruber had been with the FDA for 32 years. Gruber's deputy, Dr. Philip Krause, also plans to leave the FDA in November, according to Marks. Marks said he will serve as the acting director of the vaccines group while the FDA searches for its next director. The search process will begin immediately, he said. The memo did not give a reason for Gruber's or Krause's departures. The departures were first reported by BioCentury earlier on Tuesday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Greek PM sacks public order minister after wildfires,2212,"ATHENS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis replaced his public order and tourism ministers on Tuesday and created a new civil protection post following sharp criticism of the government's response to a spate of summer wildfires. More than a quarter of a million hectares of pine forests were destroyed in August by blazes that burned for several days across Greece, with flames reaching the outskirts of Athens. Homes and businesses were destroyed, two people were killed and thousands were forced to evacuate. read more Mitsotakis, whose conservative government took office in July 2019, has apologised publicly for delays and breakdowns in the official response to the fires, and promised to rectify mistakes. read more On Tuesday, he replaced Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis with Takis Theodorikakos, a political analyst and former interior minister. He switched Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias, who last year oversaw Greece's successful containment of the first wave of COVID-19 infections, to the country's key tourism post in place of Harry Theoharis. Mitsotakis' spokesperson also announced the creation of a civil protection ministry to be headed by Evangelos Apostolakis, a retired admiral and former defence minister. But Apostolakis, who served as defence minister under a previous Syriza leftist government, did not accept the post on grounds that an interparty consensus regarding his appointment had not been reached. The prime minister's office confirmed the rejection by Apostolakis and plans to look for a replacement for the post. The prime minister set up a natural disaster recovery committee in mid-August in the wildfires' aftermath. The reshuffle, in which Finance Minister Christos Staikouras and Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias were retained in their posts, comes less than two weeks before Mitsotakis is due to outline his 2022 economic policy in a keynote speech in Thessaloniki. Greece's economy relies strongly on tourism and is seen bouncing back by 3.6% this year as tourist arrivals pick up sharply following a dismal 2020, when coronavirus travel curbs were in force and it slumped 8.2%.

Yanomami shaman sees tough times ahead for Brazil's indigenous,4104,"BRASILIA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shaman Davi Kopenawa, chief of the Yanomami people who live on Brazil's largest indigenous reservation, fears a pending Supreme Court decision on native land claims could worsen an onslaught of aggressive mining encouraged by President Jair Bolsonaro. ""The machines will scrape off the skin of Mother Earth and wound it,"" he told Reuters in Brasilia, where thousands of indigenous protesters gathered last week to protest ahead of the landmark ruling. Kopenawa said illegal gold miners, emboldened by Bolsonaro's criticism of native land protections, are invading his people's ancestral lands on the border with Venezuela in growing numbers and using automatic weapons to intimidate the Yanomami. In the past, wildcat miners brought influenza and malaria that killed hundreds of Yanomami, but today the danger is the spread of COVID-19 that has taken nine of their people so far. On Wednesday, the top court will discuss an appeal by the Xokleng tribe against a position adopted by Brazilian governments since 2016 that claims to indigenous land can only be recognized if tribes were living there when the constitution was ratified in 1988. The Xokleng were expelled from much of their land in 1952. read more The ruling will affect 230 pending land claims, many of which offer a bulwark against deforestation in the Amazon. A defeat in court for the indigenous people would set a precedent for the rollback of native rights advocated by Bolsonaro and backed by powerful farming interests. ""Our territory was registered and signed by the federal government in 1992, but they want to reduce its size because Bolsonaro says it is too large for so few people,"" the 66-year-old shaman said in an interview. Some 29,000 Yanomami live in 360 villages spaced out over the 96,650 square kilometers (24 million acres) of reservation, about the size of Portugal, stretching from northern Brazilian savannah into the Amazon rainforest. An internationally renowned spokesman for the Yanomami, Kopenawa is the author of ""The Falling Sky,"" a poetic account of his initiation as a shaman, his first encounters with outsiders and an appeal to save his people's culture and the rainforest. WOUNDS TO THE EARTH Satellite and aerial images show the dramatic advance of polluted gold mining ponds in deforested areas along the Uraricoera and Mucajai rivers in the reservation since Bolsonaro was elected in 2018. Bolsonaro has often said indigenous people make up less than 1% of Brazilians and live on more than 13% of the country's territory, sitting on undeveloped mineral riches. Critics say his efforts to legalize mining on protected lands have encouraged the advance of illegal miners, who have swarmed the Yanomami reservation in motorboats and prop planes landing on clandestine airstrips in the forest. A wave of invasions in the 1980s brought miners offering gifts of machetes, hammocks, clothes, soap and even guns and liquor to befriend the Yanomami, Kopenawa said. They chased the women and spread killer illnesses such as influenza and malaria. Now, after international criticism that Brazil's indigenous people had been left to the mercy of the coronavirus, the government has began to vaccinate communities and, according to the Health Ministry, 84% of the target Yanomami population have had a first vaccine dose. An equally dangerous enemy is the mercury used by miners to separate gold from the earth. The toxic liquid metal is polluting rivers and poisoning the fish that the Yanomami and other indigenous people rely on to eat. read more ""The mercury wounds the Earth for years and years, and there is no medicine to cure the Earth,"" said Kopenawa, who complains the government has done little to evict the miners despite a Supreme Court order to protect indigenous people. ""They want to eliminate us and take our land. We have to keep fighting to save it for future generations so they can continue our customs, our language, our songs,"" he said.

Putin approves pre-election payments to soldiers and police in Russia,1889,"MOSCOW, Aug 31 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved one-off payments to law enforcement and military officials ahead of a parliamentary election next month, a move critics said was designed to encourage them to vote for the ruling party. The payments, worth 15,000 roubles ($200) each, will be made in September to fire fighters, police officers, prosecutors and soldiers, among others, according to two decrees signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website on Tuesday. The decrees said the payments were designed to protect the social needs of those receiving them. The Kremlin leader last month pledged similar payments to pensioners, many of whom have been affected by rising food rises and inflation of 6.5%, well above the central bank's 4% target. Kirill Rogov, a political expert who is sometimes critical of the Kremlin, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station that the payments amounted to targeted bribes of key voter groups upon whom Putin relies to remain in power. The Kremlin denies the payments are in any way connected with the elections. Putin, 68, has been in power as either president or prime minister since 1999. He helped found the ruling United Russia party which is expected to retain its dominance at next month's elections despite a slump in its rating fuelled by years of stagnating or falling real incomes. At the party's congress in June, Putin pledged additional spending on infrastructure, education and health projects designed to boost living standards. read more Putin earlier this year signed legislation barring members of groups deemed extremist, including allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, from running for office. The move, critics say, was designed to stamp out opposition to United Russia. The Kremlin denies the crackdown is political.

Geronimo the alpaca euthanised in Britain despite public outcry,1869,"LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - An eight-year-old alpaca named Geronimo, who was at the centre of a legal row with the British government and whose plight triggered a nationwide campaignto keep him alive, has been killed after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis. Video footage showed veterinary staff in blue overalls, masks, and goggles, backed by police officers, arrive at a farm in western England where the animal lived, and lead him away. The order to kill the alpaca led to pleas from owner Helen Macdonald for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie to show mercy, prompting some celebrities to demand they swerve away from what they cast as a public relations disaster. Protesters in recent weeks had shown up at Macdonald's farm to guard him from executioners after the government ordered him to be put down. More than 140,000 people had signed a petition calling for the creature to be saved. ""The infected animal was moved from the premises and euthanised by staff from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) as a necessary measure to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis,"" the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement. Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other mammal species. It can spread to humans through the ingestion of unpasteurised milk. Macdonald, a veterinary nurse, said the alpaca was negative when he was brought in from New Zealand and believes the government’s diagnosis is the result of a false positive. She has spent thousands of pounds on a failed court battle to save the animal. A spokesman for the prime minister said it is highly distressing for someone to lose an animal. ""Our sympathies are with Ms Macdonald and others that are affected by this terrible disease,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
France aims to give third COVID-19 vaccine shot to 18 million by early 2022,1910,"PARIS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - France aims to have administered a third shot of a COVID-19 vaccine to some 18 million people by early 2022, a health ministry official said on Tuesday. Last week, France's top health advisory body (HAS) recommended a booster shot for those aged 65 and over and for those with existing medical conditions that put them at risk. read more ""Those eligible for a booster shot have been able to make appointments since Monday this week. We see this as a genuine health requirement to extend protection, as some studies demonstrate,"" the official said. ""We are talking of around 18 million people who are currently eligible for a third dose. We hope to see some 12.4 million get this booster shot by year-end and the rest at the beginning of next year."" Government data shows nearly 72% of the total French population had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Aug 30. A little more than 65% had received two doses or one dose after having been diagnosed with COVID-19. There is no consensus among scientists and agencies on whether a third dose is necessary. Last week, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus, said data on third shots was inconclusive. He had previously said they should be halted and that authorities should focus on delivering doses to poorer nations. However, WHO Europe head Hans Kluge appeared to be more positive than the U.N. health body's past assessments on Monday, saying booster shots were a way to keep the most vulnerable safe. read more A fourth wave of COVID-19 infections is receding in France but the government is taking a cautious stance as schools prepare to reopen after the summer vacation.

Hong Kong to further relax law to fix doctor shortfall,1545,"HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong will further relax a contentious plan to let non-local doctors practise in the city in order to tackle a shortfall of medical staff in the public sector, the city's Health Secretary said on Tuesday. Sophia Chan, speaking at a press conference, said the government was proposing to allow foreign doctors with specialist qualifications to work in the city via a scheme which allows them to skip a decades-old compulsory exam. The scheme, which was announced at the start of this year, had initially been limited to overseas-trained Hong Kong residents and even then had sparked a backlash amongst many in the local medical sector who believed it would lower health care standards in the Asian financial hub. Some see the legislation as a first step in replacing local doctors with those from mainland China, where there are concerns over health and safety standards, more than a dozen medical workers told Reuters in May. read more Chan dismissed concerns that the law would lead to lower standards. ""We are very careful about ensuring the quality of these doctors,"" she said. Hong Kong has an acute doctor shortage with the per capita ratio two doctors per 1,000 people, far lower than other economies, the government said. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has urged medical workers to support the bill and sharply criticised medics for ""politicising"" government policies, including its response to COVID-19 and the use of the Chinese-made vaccine Sinovac.

Chinese teens vent at new gaming limits as investors weigh impact on industry,3526,"SHANGHAI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Young Chinese gamers took to social media to express their outrage at new rules that limit their gaming time to just three hours per week, while investors fretted about the long-term impact on the industry. Authorities argue the restrictions are necessary to stop growing gaming addiction and the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, said the government had to be ""ruthless"" as online games impair normal study life and the physical and mental health of teens. The curbs are part of Beijing's efforts to promote the primacy of socialism and strengthen controls over society it now views as having become too lax after years of laissez-faire growth for the tech sector and other industries. Young gamers were, however, angry. ""This group of grandfathers and uncles who make these rules and regulations, have you ever played games? Do you understand that the best age for e-sports players is in their teens?"" said one comment on China's Twitter-like Weibo. ""Sexual consent at 14, at 16 you can go out to work but you have to be 18 to play games. This is really a joke."" While the hit to gaming stocks was relatively measured as children do not provide much revenue for gaming companies, analysts noted that the implications for the long-term growth of the industry were much more severe. ""The root of the problem here is not the immediate revenue impact,"" said Mio Kato, an analyst who publishes on SmartKarma. ""The problem is that this move destroys the entire habit-forming nature of playing games at an early age."" There was also relief that the regulations did not go further. ""What the industry is really afraid of is if the government stops approving new games like they did in 2018,"" said a Beijing-based private equity investor, referring to a nine-month period when China suspended approvals of new video game titles as part of an overhaul of the regulatory bodies that oversee the sector. ""The new policy is not the worst thing that could have happened,"" said the investor who declined to identified given the sensitivity of the topic. ONUS ON GAMING COMPANIES Shares in Tencent, the world's largest gaming firm by revenue, initially slid but ended up 3%, with analysts noting it had already imposed additional limits on gaming for minors earlier this month. Krafton Inc (259960.KS), a South Korean company that earns fees by providing services for a similar game to its blockbuster ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG) to Tencent, finished 1% lower. Tokyo-listed Nexon (3659.T) and Koei Tecmo (3635.T) joined NetEase (9999.HK), which is traded in United States and Hong Kong, in losing more than 3%. The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. Kids can often circumvent rules that require the use of their real names and national identification numbers when signing into games by using the login details of adult family members. ""This is a family education issue, not a gaming issue,"" said a 17-year-old gamer who wanted to be known only by her surname Luan. But some parents like Li Tong, a hotel manager in Beijing with a 14-year old daughter, were heartened by the new rules. ""My daughter is glued to her phone after dinner every day for one to two hours and it's difficult for me or her mother to stop her,"" he said. ""We told her it's bad for her eyes and it's a waste of her time, but she won't listen."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thai PM faces parliamentary grilling as protests persist,2134,"BANGKOK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers began a censure debate against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Tuesday, as opponents threatened to intensify street protests fueled by frustration at his government's handling of a COVID-19 crisis. The political opposition accuses the former army chief and five of his cabinet ministers, including deputy prime minister and health minister Anutin Charnvirakul, of corruption, economic mismanagement and of bungling the coronavirus response. Prayuth has weathered two previous censure motions and is expected to survive a no confidence vote scheduled for Saturday, owing to his coalition's clear parliamentary majority. But the motion is unlikely to appease the youth-led anti-government groups that sought Prayuth's removal last year and have returned with renewed support from Thais angered by lockdowns, record COVID-19 deaths and a haphazard vaccine rollout. Demonstrators have threatened nationwide protests while the opposition grills Prayuth in parliament. ""Every seven minutes a Thai person died because of the blundered management of the COVID-19 situation,"" opposition leader Sompong Amornwiwat of the Pheu Thai Party said in opening the debate. ""There are economic losses of 8 billion baht ($247.60 million) per day from a lack of management and lockdown measures that have failed."" Prayuth told parliament the government was always working for public interest. ""For those who suffered, I have introduced assisting measures,"" he said. ""The government has increased domestic spending, investment and built healthcare. For you to tell me that I have nothing to show for my performance I'd say look again."" Staunch royalist Prayuth took power in a 2014 military coup and remained prime minister after a 2019 election, making him the longest-serving Thai leader since the end of the Cold War. The protests against him, which are outlawed under coronavirus restrictions, have gathered steam in recent weeks, despite frequent, at times violent clashes with police who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.

"EXCLUSIVE Thailand's elderly lag behind in COVID vaccination drive, data show",5035,"BANGKOK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Just two weeks before her long-awaited vaccine appointment in Bangkok, Anyamanee Puttaraksa's 62-year-old mother became feverish. Three days later, her mother tested positive for COVID-19. Four hours afterward, she died. Alongside Anyamanee's grief is anger at a vaccine rollout that has left the elderly among Thailand's least-vaccinated groups - a contrast to much of the rest of the world, where vulnerable older people have been a priority. ""If she had been vaccinated, her symptoms wouldn't have been so severe,"" Anyamanee said. Government data analysed for the first time by Reuters shows Thailand has fully vaccinated 6.7% of an estimated 10.9 million people 60 and older, compared with 15% of adults aged 18 to 59 and 10.2% of the total population - including children, who are not being vaccinated. Thailand was the only one of 30 countries for which Reuters reviewed data that had a lower percentage of seniors vaccinated than those in younger age groups. Neighbouring Malaysia had fully vaccinated at least 82% of its senior citizens by Aug. 22, according to government data, compared with 45.6% of its total population to date. In Indonesia, only 17% of the elderly have been fully vaccinated, but that is still higher than the 13% for the total population. Chawetsan Namwat, a senior official at the public health ministry's Department of Disease Control, said plans to prioritise the elderly shifted after a major outbreak in Bangkok and added that the relatively low rate of vaccinations in that age group could have led to more deaths among senior citizens. Since April, people aged 60 and over have accounted for at least 62% of deaths in Thailand and about 8.7% of cases. The proportion of elderly deaths has risen, pointing to the possible impact of slow vaccinations. In Indonesia, the elderly account for nearly 12% of cases, but only 47% of deaths. Critics of Thailand's vaccination policy blame it in part for a spike to more than 10,000 deaths in a country where fewer than 100 people died of COVID-19 last year. ""The higher death toll now is a direct result of the failure to prioritise the elderly earlier,"" said Chris Potranandana, co-founder of Zendai, a volunteer group helping the old and the poor access COVID tests and treatment. Chawetsan said that the higher number of deaths in the current outbreak corresponded with higher case numbers and that death rates were only slightly higher in this outbreak. Since April, Thailand's case fatality rate - the ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases - has nearly tripled to 0.96%, from the first two outbreaks' average of 0.33%, data analysed by Reuters show. The rate for the elderly is 7.2%, up from 4% earlier. SHIFTING PRIORITIES Although the government initially announced that the elderly would be a priority group for vaccinations, planning shifted from an age-based priority system to a geographically-based one after an outbreak in Bangkok in April. But younger and working-age groups in the capital ended up being able to access vaccination centres more easily than senior citizens, resulting in lower inoculation rates for the elderly, Chawetsan said. ""We were going to prioritise the elderly but we didn't foresee the massive wave of infections from the Delta variant,"" Chawetsan said. ""When that happened, we had to pool our supply for the risk area with high infection rates and vaccinate all age groups there to curb infections."" Bangkok was allocated a third of Thailand's vaccine supply when the country's mass rollout began in June, despite having only a tenth of the population, official data analysed by Reuters show. Another chunk of vaccines went to the tourist island of Phuket, where a government plan to vaccinate all adults has allowed it to resume limited international tourism. A chaotic start to the vaccine rollout could also have made it harder for the elderly, Potranandana said. Vaccination bookings were invited on a plethora of mobile apps and websites and sometimes cancelled at short notice or set far in the future because of vaccine shortages. ""Access wasn't oriented towards the elderly, who are the least technologically-savvy group,"" he said. Chawetsan said early registration numbers were also low because of vaccine hesitancy among the elderly. The government says it now aims to step up vaccinations for the elderly. Chawetsan said at 70% or more of senior citizens should have at least gotten their first doses by the end of September. A concerted vaccination push in Bangkok now means 97% of senior citizens there have had at least one dose - higher than the 90% for the city's total population - with 7% of the elderly fully vaccinated. Many families complain it came too late. ""They should have vaccinated the elderly right after health and frontline workers,"" said 18-year-old Thippawan Rodinthra, whose 78-year-old grandfather died of COVID-19 last month. ""Between grief and anger, I'm more angry at the government."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

'Perfectionist' Osaka keen to change mindset at US Open and beyond,2038,"NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Defending U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka said on Monday she had put undue pressure on herself by constantly striving for perfection and that going forward she wanted to stop picking holes in her own performances and be happy with trying her best. Osaka, who began her Flushing Meadows title defence with a 6-4 6-1 win over Czech Marie Bouzkova, withdrew from this year's French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to do media duties. The former world number one had said facing the media contributed to the mental health issues she had struggled with for years. She told reporters on Monday she was her own worst critic. ""I tell people that I'm a perfectionist,"" said Osaka, who beat American great Serena Williams to win the first of her four Grand Slam titles at the U.S. Open in 2018. ""I think for me something that's less than perfection, even though it might be something great, is a disappointment. ""I don't really think that's a healthy way of thinking. So something that I really wanted to change,"" she added. The 23-year-old said she wanted to be happy with knowing that she had tried her best at the U.S. Open, and that even if she made mistakes she would learn from them and keep on playing. ""It's not really a tournament thing, it's more like a life thing. Like I hope I can keep this mindset throughout my life going forward,"" she added. Osaka had said on social media at the weekend she intended to celebrate her own achievements more and told reporters on Monday it was important to believe in herself more. ""For me, one of the biggest things is hearing a little kid telling me that I'm their favourite player or I'm a role model. Instinctively the first thought in my mind is like, 'Why?' ""I feel like I have to sort of embrace more the feeling, the honour that they're telling me that, and I should believe more in myself. I feel like if you don't believe in yourself, then other people won't believe in you."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
S. Korean COVID-19 vaccine in late-stage test against AstraZeneca shot,2249,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Bioscience (302440.KS) and Britain's GSK (GSK.L) said on Tuesday the drugmakers had begun a late-stage trial of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate against AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) approved shot, the second study of its kind globally. The AstraZeneca vaccine will take the place of a dummy shot in the trial, which will enrol about 4,000 candidates worldwide. It will test SK's candidate, GBP510, in combination with GSK's vaccine booster after positive early-stage data and a greenlight from South Korea earlier this month. read more Shots from Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O), J&J (JNJ.N) and AstraZeneca have been approved for use in South Korea. However, its inoculation campaign has been dogged by vaccine shortages and shipment delays amid a surging fourth wave of infections. A potential success of the SK vaccine, the country's first domestic candidate, would help cut reliance on Western shots. ""While many countries have made good progress with vaccination, there remains a need for accessible and affordable COVID-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access and to protect people across the world,"" said GSK Chief Global Health Officer, Thomas Breuer. The GSK-SK vaccine, if approved, would be supplied worldwide through the World Health Organization-led COVAX vaccine sharing programme, the companies said, adding that results from the study were expected in the first half next year. Researchers in some countries may not be able give a placebo shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available for ethical reasons. France's Valneva (VLS.PA) is also conducting a late-stage trial against AstraZeneca's shot. The vaccine by SK, also a contract manufacturer for AstraZeneca and Novavax (NVAX.O), is a coronavirus protein-based vaccine, while AstraZeneca's shot uses a modified version of a common-cold virus to deliver immunity-building instructions. British drugmaker GSK, the world's largest vaccine maker by sales, has focused on supplying its adjuvant, or booster, to developers rather than make its own shot in the first leg of the vaccine race. Shares of SK Bioscience closed up about 5% on Tuesday, while GSK was down 0.6% in morning trade. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. Open day one,6365,"NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray went down fighting in the first round of the U.S. Open as third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas triumphed in a near five-hour contest on Monday. As fans returned in numbers to Flushing Meadows for the first time in two years, they were treated to quality tennis at Arthur Ashe Stadium where Tsitsipas won 2-6 7-6(7) 3-6 6-3 6-4, even as Murray fumed over what he saw as the Greek's stalling tactics. ""I lost respect for him,"" Murray said after Tsitsipas took a bathroom break and a medical timeout that broke the Scot's momentum. Second seed Daniil Medvedev beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-3 6-1 in the final match of the day and the Russian was relieved it did not go the distance after watching many players struggle physically. ""I'm happy that I didn't stay out here for five hours,"" Medvedev said. Fans stayed well beyond midnight hoping to be entertained by Nick Kyrgios but the only fireworks the Australian provided were arguments with the chair umpire over towels while slumping to a 6-3 6-4 6-0 loss to Roberto Bautista Agut. Two-time champion Naomi Osaka kicked off her title defence with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Czech Marie Bouzkova and she was happy to have the crowd back.

Taiwan expects much-anticipated first BioNTech vaccines to arrive soon,2229,"TAIPEI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Around 900,000 doses of BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine are expected to arrive in Taiwan soon, the health minister said on Tuesday, the first delivery of a highly politicised, much-anticipated order whose tortured progress has transfixed the island. Taiwan has blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an order from the German firm earlier this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high profile billionaire founder Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the shot. A $350 million deal for 10 million shots was inked last month, which will be donated to the government for distribution. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung, asked whether the first of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) vaccines would arrive on Wednesday, told reporters he was not able to give an exact timetable, ""but the time mentioned is very close"". ""The number is around 900,000 doses,"" he added. BioNTech, which jointly developed the vaccine with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), declined to comment. Chen said that the arrival of the vaccines had ""great meaning"" for Taiwan, and he would definitely go to the airport to receive them. ""I'll only go when the aircraft arrives,"" he said. Taiwan is getting the shots earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. read more While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order. More than 10 million vaccine doses have arrived in Taiwan to date, split between Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), while local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp's (6547.TWO) shots have also started to be administered.

New Zealand COVID-19 cases drop for second day amid lockdowns,2183,"WELLINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - New Zealand's government on Tuesday reported that new COVID-19 cases fell for a second day, down to 49, amid the tight lockdown the country undertook during the latest outbreak this month. Except for a small number of cases in February, New Zealand was mainly coronavirus-free for months, until an outbreak of the Delta variant imported from Australia prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. The total number of cases in the outbreak is at 612, with 597 in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland and 15 in the capital Wellington. The declining number of daily cases signals that the social restrictions are reducing the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant, Ardern said in a news conference. ""We have a second day where our numbers have declined. We want the tail of this outbreak to be as short as possible,"" Ardern said. Around 1.7 million Aucklanders will remain in strict level 4 lockdown for another two weeks, while restrictions for the remainder of the country will ease slightly from Wednesday. read more Police placed checkpoints at the outskirts of Auckland to ensure no non-essential movement was allowed into the city. Police also said they had arrested 19 people on Tuesday following anti-lockdown protest around the country. There are now 33 people in hospitals from the latest Delta outbreak, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said, with eight cases in stable condition in intensive care. ""It is sobering to see six cases in the outbreak are under the age of one,"" he said But he added that the public health measures in place were slowing the spread of the virus and cases will continue to decline. Ardern's lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, were credited with reining in COVID-19. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Factbox: India prepares for future COVID surge as cases inch up,1836,"NEW DELHI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - India's health infrastructure proved inadequate when COVID-19 cases surged in April and May this year, leading to tens of thousands of deaths as hospitals ran out of oxygen and beds. Infections have started rising again and experts warn of another big jump around October, India's peak festival season. Federal and state governments have said they are more prepared this time around. Here are some numbers shared by the government in parliament as of July or early August: HOSPITAL BEDS * Dedicated hospitals to treat COVID patients have jumped 27 times to 4,389 from April last year. More than 18,000 other centres have been set up mainly for less-serious patients. * Oxygen-supported beds rise eight fold to 416,947. * Total isolation beds jump to 1.8 million from 10,180 in March 2020. * ICU beds rise to 124,598 from 2,168 in March 2020. * Testing capacity jumps to more than 2 million samples a day from 30,000 in April 2020. * The health ministry has supplied about 45,000 ventilators to government hospitals across the country. MEDICAL OXYGEN * The federal government and its ministries are setting up a total of 1,573 PSA oxygen-generation plants, although fewer than 300 plants had started by early August. * Total number of medical oxygen carriers has gone up by 225 to 1,244 since March 2020. PAEDIATRIC WARDS, MEDICINES * Almost all states are setting up special paediatric wards as experts warn unvaccinated children could be vulnerable to any new mutations in the virus. * Some states are also stocking up on anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir. * India is also trying to vaccinate a big majority of its 944 million adults with at least one dose before another COVID wave. More than 52% of its adults have been partially vaccinated so far. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Explainer: What we know about Japan's contaminated Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,3411,"TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japan's COVID-19 vaccination push suffered a blow from widening reports of contamination in supplies of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) vaccine. read more Here are key aspects of the concerns. WHEN WAS IT FIRST REPORTED AND HOW HAS IT WIDENED? The first contamination was reported to Moderna's local distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T), on Aug. 16. That led to the discovery of 39 vials containing foreign material, all from the same lot of 57,000, or about 570,000 doses. On Aug. 26, Japan said that, as a precaution, it had halted use of 1.63 million Moderna doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide. It suspended the use of lot 3004667 that included those vials and two similarly sized lots - 3004734 and 3004956. On Sunday, a vaccination centre in Okinawa prefecture reported finding contaminants from a fourth lot, 3005293. Black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial, with pink substances found in another syringe, the health ministry said. A vaccine centre in Gunma prefecture near Tokyo found a tiny, black substance in a vial from lot 3005236. read more Regional authorities temporarily halted use of the affected lots from Okinawa and Gunma. Later, the health ministry and Takeda said there were no safety concerns and no suspension of use was necessary. The Okinawa cases were probably caused by needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters on Tuesday. read more WHAT ARE THE CONTAMINANTS? The contaminants that triggered suspensions of the first three lots are believed to be metallic particles, public broadcaster NHK said, citing health ministry sources. The ministry has not officially identified the particles, pending an investigation by Takeda, Moderna, and its Spanish contract manufacturing partner Rovi (ROVI.MC). The firms have also yet to comment on what the foreign material is. IS THERE A SAFETY ISSUE? Japan and Moderna have said no safety issues were identified. Two men, aged 38 and 30, died this month within days of receiving their second Moderna doses, the health ministry said on Saturday. Each had a dose from one of the suspended lots, 3004734. The causes of death are being investigated. Each had a fever the day after his second dose and died two days after getting the fever. There has been no evidence of contaminants in their shots, a health ministry official told reporters. By Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving COVID-19 shots from Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech, and 11 after receiving Moderna's. No causality has been established between the injections and deaths, according to the health ministry. About 500,000 people have had shots from the first three suspended batches, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccine push, told reporters on Friday. ARE OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO AFFECTED? Rovi, which packages Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said last week the batch in question was meant for distribution only in Japan. South Korea, which also receives the Moderna vaccines produced from sites in the United States and Spain, said it was not affected. Last week, the European Union drugs regulator said it was investigating the incident but an initial assessment yielded no reason to seek a temporary suspension of production. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Xi’s anti-screen campaign will reshape family time,3638,"HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping wants to reshape Chinese family time at the private sector’s expense. New rules restrict kids to three hours of video games a week to combat smartphone addiction. The financial hit looks manageable for gaming giants like Tencent (0700.HK). But the president wants to drag children away from screens into healthier activities, which will require harsher measures. The latest curbs are strict. Minors under 18 years old are only allowed one hour of game time on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as well as on public holidays. The previous rule allowed them to play an hour and a half on any day, and three hours on holidays. Investors in Hong Kong promptly knocked off some $20 billion from Tencent's market value, roughly 4%, on the news. The sell-off extended to rivals NetEase (9999.HK) and Bilibili (9626.HK). Tencent's smash hit ""Honour of Kings"" is so popular that it has been singled out by state media in a recent column lambasting video-games as ""spiritual opium"". Still, the $575 billion company insists that its systems for verifying identity and limiting game time are adequate. The latest curbs shouldn’t hit the bottom line too hard. In the three months to June, those under 16 accounted for just 2.6% of its domestic gaming revenue. Official distaste for video-games is aggravated by worries about the country's myopia epidemic, a combined side-effect of constant cramming plus screen glare. An estimated 81% of high school students are short-sighted, according to government figures cited by state media in June; Xi is officially concerned, as is the military. The government has already banned for-profit tutoring and is pushing to reduce homework loads. To prevent children from simply shifting to other forms of on-screen entertainment, more online restrictions are likely. Officials are also preparing to reverse decades of systemic under-investment in physical fitness infrastructure like public sports facilities and parks. Parents will feel the change. Workaholics will find it harder to foist off children on tutors or use addictive games and apps as de-facto babysitters, but then the government is trying to reduce overtime too. Over the longer term, this could be healthy for Chinese families, but not so much for businesses. Follow @mak_robyn on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - China's National Press and Publication Administration on Aug. 30 published new rules that allow those under 18 years old to play video games for up to one hour a day, between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. They can also play for an hour, at the same time, on public holidays. - ""Teenagers are the future of our motherland,"" official news service Xinhua quoted an unnamed NPPA spokesperson as saying.

South Korea to begin offering COVID-19 vaccine booster shots in October,2200,"SEOUL, Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Korea plans to begin giving out COVID-19 booster shots from October, joining several countries that have approved such doses amid resurgent infections and concern that vaccine protection wanes over time. The plan will kick in once an October target for full vaccination of 70% of the population is achieved, as authorities aim to boost the rate above 80% with coverage for pregnant women and minors aged between 12 and 17 in the fourth quarter. Initial booster doses will go to those with weakened immune systems or deemed to be at high risk. Others will receive them six months after full vaccination, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said. ""We will start with booster shots for high-risk groups such as the elderly and virus-prevention, medical personnel and gradually expand inoculation in line with expert recommendation and decisions by health authorities,"" President Moon Jae-in told his top aides on Monday. Although the World Health Organization has repeatedly urged a delay in booster doses, arguing that the world's most vulnerable people should be fully vaccinated first, several countries have approved them, citing data on waning protection. Vaccine booster doses will be made widely available to Americans in September, while nations from France and Germany to Israel have decided to offer them to older adults and those with weak immunity. Evidence is growing that protection from COVID-19 vaccines ebbs after six months or more, especially in older people with underlying health conditions. read more In June, South Korea said it planned to secure more mRNA vaccines for booster doses next year for the entire population, on top of its already agreed 106 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N)/(22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O). South Korea has struggled to rein in daily COVID-19 cases as it battles its worst wave of infections since early July. Monday's 1,372 new cases take its tally of infections to 251,421, with a death toll of 2,285. By Monday, at least 56.5% of the population of 52 million had received at least one vaccine dose, while 29.6% had completed the inoculation. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Japan health minister says Okinawa vaccine contaminants likely from needle stick,1691,"TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japan's health minister said on Tuesday it was highly likely that foreign matter found in Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccines in the southern prefecture of Okinawa were caused when needles were stuck into the vials. Some Moderna shots were temporarily halted in Okinawa on Sunday after foreign materials were discovered in vials and syringes. The health ministry said later needles may have been incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. ""Whatever the reason (for the foreign matter) we have heard that there is no safety or other issues,"" health minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters, adding that it was not uncommon for foreign material to enter a vial with other vaccines. ""We will continue to gather information and report back,"" he added. Japan is facing its biggest wave of COVID-19 infections so far during the pandemic, driven by the highly transmissable Delta variant. A race to boost inoculations has been hampered by delays in imported vaccines and the discovery of the contaminants in some Moderna doses that prompted the suspension of three batches last week. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the inoculation campaign, said on Tuesday he wanted to speed up shipments of vaccines to municipalities that had been forced to put a halt reservations due to shortages. The government is considering when and how to give out booster shots that may be needed to maintain immunity against the virus but is focusing for now on completing the first two shots for the public, Kono told reporters.

About 1.6 mln more Americans had health insurance in 2020 - CDC,1654,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - About 1.6 million more Americans had some form of health insurance coverage despite the COVID-19 crisis last year, helped mainly by enrollment growth in government-sponsored health plans, early data from a U.S. government office showed. Estimates based on a household survey by the statistics division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed on Tuesday that a total of 31.6 million, or 9.7% of Americans of all ages, were uninsured last year, down from 33.2 million in 2019. Among Americans of all age groups, the number of people with public health plan coverage grew by 2.1 million to 123.5 million in 2020, while those that had private health insurance grew by 1.9 million to 200.6 million. The United States last year saw a steep rise in job cuts compared to 2019, as companies were forced to layoff employees to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. About 14% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 were uninsured last year, compared to 14.7% in 2019. Hispanic adults were the most likely to lack health insurance coverage, followed by non-Hispanic black adults, the National Center for Health Statistics survey showed. Americans with a family income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level, had the highest percentage of coverage from public health plans such as those of Medicaid, Medicare or children's health insurance program, the survey showed. Officials said the estimates for last year could be impacted by lower response rates, as lockdowns due to the pandemic forced data collection to switch to a telephone-only mode beginning March 2020.

"Louisiana hospitals avoid Ida catastrophe, but staffing challenges loom",2855,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Louisiana hospitals largely escaped catastrophic damage from Hurricane Ida, but the storm created the ""perfect petri dish"" for spread of the coronavirus, officials said on Monday. The weather disaster hit a state where hospitals are crowded with COVID patients, cases of the Delta variant were surging and nurses were in short supply. A handful of smaller hospitals have been forced to evacuate patients, while all major regional hospitals were doing fine for now, Dr. Joseph Kanter, the top medical official in Louisiana, told Reuters by phone. ""Outside of a few, small outlying hospitals, it doesn't appear to be anything catastrophic,"" said Kanter, who worked through the harrowing days of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when some two dozen hospitals in New Orleans had to be evacuated. Warner Thomas, the CEO of Ochsner Health, the largest healthcare provider in the state, said Monday night that two of its smaller hospitals southwest of New Orleans had been evacuated because of damage to roofs and flooding. That affected 65 patients at St. Anne Hospital and Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center, where temporary roofing was being installed. Thomas said Ochsner helped move about 100 patients from Terrebone General Medical Center in Houma, southwest of New Orleans, which is a partner hospital with Ochsner. So far there were no reports of any injuries to patients or staff members because of Hurricane Ida, Thomas said. All Ochsner hospitals in New Orleans suffered roof damage and are working on generator power as electricity remains out, Thomas said, including powering operating rooms where surgeries are still being carried out. The facilities have a 10-day supply of fuel on site, with more on the way already. Nearly all of Louisiana was without power Monday. Many hospitals were using their own water wells while they awaited the restoration of city water services, he said. ""The biggest challenge in the coming days is around our people,"" Thomas said. Doctors, nurses and other staff members have damage to their homes or no power. Ochsner is working on housing them in hotels and elsewhere. Louisiana was already facing a shortage of more than 6,000 nurses before the storm hit, so having more personnel out dealing with damage to their homes would put even more stress on the system, Thomas said. Dr. Rebekah Gee, who until last year was the health secretary for Louisiana and now leads Louisiana State University's healthcare services division, worried about where evacuated patients would go when wards are filled with COVID patients and how the spread of COVID would be impacted. ""This is a perfect petri dish condition for COVID to grow,"" she said. ""People are in close quarters, they aren't going outside, and a lot of congregate sheltering is going to be starting.""

Japan's Moderna vaccine contamination woes widen as regions put holds on shots,3884,"TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine contamination woes in Japan widened after two regions put temporary holds on shots following the discovery of foreign substances in more batches. The disruption to Moderna supplies comes as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 yet, driven by the contagious Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time amid a slow vaccine rollout. The latest reports of vaccine contamination came from Gunma prefecture near Tokyo and the southern prefecture of Okinawa, prompting temporary holds on Sunday on shots from two new Moderna lots. That followed the nationwide suspension of 1.63 million doses last week. A tiny black substance was found in a Moderna vaccine vial in Gunma, an official from the prefecture said, while in Okinawa, black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial, and pink material was found in a different syringe. Japan's health ministry said some of the incidents may have been due to needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. The ministry and Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), which distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan, said there were no safety issues from the Okinawa and Gunma incidents and that there was no need for nationwide suspensions. Gunma and Okinawa can resume using vials from the lots in question as long as they do not contain foreign materials, the ministry told a briefing late on Monday. The contamination cases come on the heels of a government report on Saturday that two people died after receiving Moderna shots that were among lots later suspended. The government had said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was a precaution. The causes of death are being investigated. ""It is unlikely, in my opinion, that contamination of foreign substances led directly to sudden deaths,"" said Takahiro Kinoshita, a physician and vice chair of Cov-Navi, a vaccine information group. ""If the contaminated substances were dangerous enough to cause death for some people, probably many more people would have suffered from some symptoms after the vaccination. ""However, further investigations are definitely needed to evaluate the harm of the particular doses in question."" 'LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE' Japan earlier halted the use of 1.63 million Moderna doses, shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide after Takeda received reports of contaminants in some vials. Some 500,000 people received shots from those supplies, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccine push, has said. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said at the time that the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of Rovi's production lines. Rovi said, in a statement on Sunday, that an investigation was under way in coordination with Moderna, Takeda and the health authorities. Takeda also said, on Monday, that the investigation was ongoing. Rovi shares closed down 13.5% on Monday. Nicholas Rennick, an Australian doctor practicing at the NTT Medical Centre in Tokyo, said the contamination ""is a serious problem"" and there is need to investigate, but given rising COVID-19 cases, Moderna vaccinations should ""continue with appropriate precautions"". Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 44% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries. ""We've got thousands of Delta variant patients around Japan as we speak, spreading the virus, and so many of the population remain unvaccinated and unprotected,"" Rennick said. ""We have to look at the bigger picture."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Florida withholds funds from two school districts over mask mandates,1867,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Florida Department of Education said on Monday it has withheld funds from two school districts that made masks mandatory in classrooms this fall. ""Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld the monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward County, as directed by the State Board of Education,"" the department said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Florida Board of Education told the two school districts that some of their state funding would be withheld if they failed to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that children wear masks. A Florida state judge on Friday ruled that the state had no authority to enforce an order by Governor Ron DeSantis banning public school districts from requiring masks in classrooms, and barring his administration from withholding funds over mask mandates. read more School boards in Broward and Alachua counties have mandated masks in schools in defiance of an executive order issued last month by DeSantis that barred local officials from imposing mask mandates. ""Each district has implemented a mandatory face mask policy that violates parental rights by not allowing a parent or legal guardian to opt-out their child,"" the statement said, adding that the penalties will continue until the school boards comply. Florida is one of several states where Republican governors have sought to prevent local governments and school districts from mandating masks. These governors have said that such rules infringe on personal liberty. Proponents of mask mandates have said the rules are necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases rise particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates, driven by the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant.

'Mission: Impossible' sues insurance company over 7 COVID shutdowns,2374,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. LOS ANGELES, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Production on the new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie was shut down seven times due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday that accuses the film's insurance company of failing to pay out for all but one of the costly stoppages. Filming on the action series starring Tom Cruise was delayed four times in Italy, and three times in the United Kingdom between February 2020 and June 2021, said the lawsuit filed by Paramount Pictures in U.S. federal court in California. The stoppages were caused by positive coronavirus tests among members of the cast or crew, or quarantine or lockdowns imposed in countries where the thriller was being filmed. The lawsuit accuses Indiana-based Federal Insurance Company of breach of contract, saying it has agreed only to pay out $5 million for the first stoppage. Federal Insurance did not immediately return a request for comment. Cruise, who is also a producer on the film, lost his temper on the set of ""Mission: Impossible 7"" in England in December over a breach in COVID protocols, threatening to fire cast and crew members who did not take them seriously. ""Mission: Impossible"" is one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood, with 2018's ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" taking more than $791 million at the worldwide box office. Multiple film and television productions have been disrupted by the pandemic and the cost of testing, consultants and protective equipment has added millionsof dollars to their budgets. Paramount said in the lawsuit that the insurance company argued there was ""no evidence that those cast and crew members could not continue their duties, despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and posing an undeniable risk to other individuals involved with the production."" Paramount did not say how much the shutdowns had cost but said its losses ""far exceeded"" the $5 million that Federal had agreed to pay for the first instance of coronavirus in February 2020. Paramount is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages. The delayed ""Mission: Impossible 7"" is due to be released in May 2022."
U.S. opens investigations into bans on school mask mandates in 5 states,2625,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education is opening civil rights investigations to determine whether five states that have banned schools from requiring masks are discriminating against students with disabilities, the agency said on Monday. The department is targeting Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, all Republican-led states, in its investigations. It said it was concerned that their bans on mandatory masking could leave students with disabilities and underlying health conditions more vulnerable to COVID-19, limiting their access to in-person learning opportunities. ""It's simply unacceptable that state leaders are putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. ""The Department will fight to protect every student's right to access in-person learning safely and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall."" As millions of U.S. public school students head back to the classroom, numerous school districts and state education agencies are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements, especially in the South where the virus is surging. After the announcement of the investigations, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds accused the Biden administration of playing politics. ""I believe and trust in Iowans to make the best health decisions for themselves and their families,"" Reynolds said in a news release. ""Iowa’s democratically elected legislature endorsed that view as well when they passed a law to support a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their own children."" Florida, Texas, Arkansas and Arizona are four other Republican-led states that have banned mandatory masking orders in schools. The Education Department left those states out of its inquiry because court orders or other actions have paused their enforcement, it said in a news release. The department says it is monitoring those states and would take action if local mask-wearing policies are later barred from going into effect. A Florida state judge on Friday ruled that the state had no authority to enforce an order by Governor Ron DeSantis banning public school districts from requiring masks in classrooms. Before the ruling, multiple school districts in the state had defied the governor's order, putting in place mandates that provide exceptions for students with medical conditions. DeSantis has said his office will appeal the court's decision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
BHP considers making COVID vaccinations mandatory at Australian sites,2003,"MELBOURNE, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group (BHP.AX) is mulling whether to make vaccinations for COVID-19 mandatory at its workplaces in Australia as the country's east battles ballooning virus cases. The world's biggest miner on Monday set out measures it was taking to support vaccination in communities where it operates including on-site jabs at its Mt Arthur Coal Mine in New South Wales state that are to begin this week. The state has become the epicentre of Australia's current coronavirus outbreak, having declared a record 1,290 new cases on Monday as the nation struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant. read more Although Australia has used a system of strict lockdowns and quarantine to keep coronavirus infection and death rates lower than in most comparable nations, the Delta variant is now pressuring health services. Residents of its two biggest cities have been on strict lockdown for more than a month. BHP said in a statement that it was actively assessing vaccination as a condition of entry to its workplaces. ""As vaccinations become more accessible to all Australians, we have been encouraging our people to better protect themselves and their families and communities, and we will look for further opportunities to increase access and uptake of vaccinations,"" Edgar Basto, who runs BHP's Minerals Australia business, said. BHP expects to complete its assessment in September, with a policy likely to come into effect in early 2022, once people have had a reasonable opportunity to be fully vaccinated. The miner is funding a new vaccine hub in central Queensland near its coal joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T), and is working with South Australian health authorities to establish a mobile clinic near its Olympic Dam copper mine.

Brazil abandons plans to have fans at Argentine qualifier,1267,"SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities have abandoned plans to allow a crowd of 12,000 to watch Sunday’s World Cup qualifier with Argentina due to what the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said was a lack of time to prepare. The CBF had promised a 12,000 crowd would be the first step to the possible reopening of stadiums in Brazil after almost a year-and-a-half of games without fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, only 1,500 invited guests will be allowed inside the 48,234-capacity Neo Quimica Arena, home of Sao Paulo club Corinthians, for the match.

U.S. vaccine advisers unanimously favor Pfizer/BioNTech shot after approval,3150,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday unanimously recommended the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration last week granted full approval to the vaccine that was previously available under the agency's emergency use authorization (EUA), which had allowed the shots to be rolled out rapidly to Americans. Health officials hope the formal approval and CDC recommendation will spur more Americans to get vaccinated. With full FDA approval, some companies and states have begun mandating COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination rates remain low in many parts of the United States, contributing to a big surge in hospitalizations due to the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Some panel members said increasing vaccinations before the fall season was critical to getting children back to schools safely. ""Everyone who has anything to do with a child that is not old enough to be vaccinated yet should be vaccinated for the benefit of their children,"" said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, an infectious disease specialist who was part of the panel. Regulators have authorized a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines for those with weak immune systems, and the U.S. government has said it plans to make booster doses available to more Americans in September. The CDC advisers are considering an approach to boosters that would focus on preventing severe disease among those most at risk - residents in long-term care facilities, other older adults and healthcare workers - much like the original vaccine rollout. CDC staff presented available data on the need for boosters and said, at this point it may be difficult to determine whether immunity from prior vaccination is waning over time or if the vaccines are just less able to prevent infection by the highly-transmissible Delta variant. Several panel members expressed concern about the White House announcement of a booster policy starting in September, even before the vaccine advisory panel had seen the evidence or determined that such a campaign was needed. read more Members of the vaccine advisory working group, which is shaping the agency's approach to boosters, stressed that the top U.S. priority remains getting shots to the unvaccinated. Another meeting will be scheduled in mid-September to discuss boosters. At Monday's meeting, the CDC reiterated that the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweigh potential risks associated with the shots. New Zealand on Monday reported its first death linked to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine after a woman suffered myocarditis, a type of inflammation of the heart muscle that is a known rare side effect of the vaccine. read more Health officials there said other factors could have contributed to her death.

Abortion providers ask U.S. Supreme Court to block Texas' six-week ban,2237,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Abortion rights groups filed an emergency request at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which is set to take effect on Wednesday. The groups, including Planned Parenthood and other abortion and women's health providers, told the court that the law would ""immediately and catastrophically reduce abortion access in Texas, barring care for at least 85% of Texas abortion patients"" and would likely force many abortion clinics to close. The groups challenged the law in federal court in Austin in July, contending it violates a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The law, signed on May 19, is unusual in that it gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion past the six-week cutoff. The law is among of a number of ""heartbeat"" abortion bans enacted in Republican-led states. These laws seek to ban the procedure once the rhythmic contracting of fetal cardiac tissue can be detected, often at six weeks - sometimes before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Courts have blocked such bans as a violation of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The state of Mississippi has asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade in a major case the justices agreed to hear over a 2018 law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The justices will hear arguments in their term that begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. The Texas lawsuit seeks to prevent judges, county clerks and other state entities from enforcing the law through citizen lawsuits. The plaintiffs also sued the director of an anti-abortion group that they said has threatened enforcement actions under the new law. A federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss the case, prompting an immediate appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which halted further proceedings in the case. On Sunday, the 5th Circuit denied a request by the abortion providers to block the law pending the appeal. The plaintiffs on Monday asked the Supreme Court to block the Texas law or allow proceedings in the lower court to continue."
Uber proposes industry-wide gig worker benefits model in Canada,2664,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) on Monday proposed a plan for a flexible benefits fund for app-based ride-hail and food delivery drivers in Canada under which all gig industry players would share data on workers' hours and earnings. Under the preliminary proposal outlined in a company blog post, the fund would provide gig workers with cash benefits to put toward a retirement or life insurance plan, or to pay for educational or dental and health benefits not covered by Canada's universal healthcare system. The benefits fund would be enabled by Canada's provincial governments, Uber said in the blog post without providing further details, but managed by ride-hail and delivery companies. The companies would share data on drivers' hours and earnings and pay into the fund proportionally. Workers would qualify for fund benefits if they meet a threshold, which Uber's Monday proposal did not disclose. Uber in a statement said it welcomed discussions with other industry players, adding the benefits fund was part of a recent Ontario government submission. DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) in a statement said it welcomed other stakeholders who wanted to provide workers with benefits while maintaining their flexibility, but did not directly comment on Uber's plan. Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) and Just Eat Takeaway.com's (TKWY.AS) Grubhub did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Uber said it advocates for benefits funds everywhere, but added that labor laws, social safety nets and different cultures meant it would pursue a different approach in every country, with Monday's proposal tailored to Canada. Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer their independent contractor workers. Many labor unions, some lawmakers and the Biden administration have said gig workers should be reclassified as employees. read more The companies have also faced several lawsuits in Canada and the United States alleging worker misclassification. The companies have rejected calls for reclassification, saying surveys showed the majority of their workers do not want to be employees. In recent years, the companies have suggested limited benefit models while maintaining workers' contractor status, including in California where voters approved such a proposal last year. The companies at times have argued apportioning benefits is complicated by the fact that many drivers work for multiple platforms at once. In a March blog post outlining its initial Canadian proposal, Uber advocated for industry-wide reforms that held every company to the same standards.

U.S. health department sets up climate change office,2245,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established an office to address climate change and health equity at the national level, Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Monday. The office aims to protect vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by pollution and climate-driven disasters, including drought and wildfires, he said. ""There is no doubt that America is experiencing climate change, and there is no reason for us to doubt that we must take this on immediately, because it's not just about the climate, it's not just about our environment. It's about our health."" Becerra spoke to reporters as Hurricane Ida knocked out power across Louisiana and Mississippi, killing at least one person and littering roads with downed power lines and debris. President Joe Biden declared major disasters and ordered federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in both states. Becerra declared public health emergencies there. Biden has made tackling the climate crisis domestically and abroad a key part of his agenda. He ordered in May the creation of a comprehensive government-wide climate-risk strategy within 120 days. Establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity is part of that strategy, Becerra said. The office will identify communities disproportionately exposed to climate hazards, address health disparities resulting from climate change, and help with regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare sector. Biden aims to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The health sector accounts for roughly 8.5% of U.S carbon emissions, and the global health sector accounts for around 4.5% of the world's emissions, said Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine. The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250,000 deaths annually. Dr. John Balbus, senior public health adviser to the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is interim director of the new office. Arsenio Mataka, formerly Becerra's environmental adviser when he was California attorney general, joined the department as senior adviser for climate change and health equity."
U.S. urges lawyers to volunteer to fight feared surge of evictions,2219,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday urged attorneys across the legal profession to volunteer their time to assist the crush of tenants expected to be forced out of homes now that a COVID-19 pandemic-related eviction moratorium has ended. The move came four days after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a federal moratorium aimed at keeping people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Democratic President Joe Biden and top members of his party in Congress blasted that decision but have not taken further emergency action to stop what could be a wave of evictions. In a letter addressed to ""members of the legal community,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said eviction filings are expected to spike to roughly double their pre-pandemic levels and that lawyers have an ethical obligation to help the most vulnerable. ""We can do that by doing everything we can to ensure that people have a meaningful opportunity to stay in their homes and that eviction procedures are carried out in a fair and just manner,"" Garland said. Garland's letter encouraged lawyers to volunteer at legal aid providers, or to help tenants apply for emergency rent relief through government programs. Garland said ""the vast majority of tenants need access to legal counsel because far too many evictions result from default judgments in which the tenant never appeared in court."" The nation's top court on Thursday granted a request by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that was to have run until Oct. 3, saying it was up to Congress to act. Over 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives pushed for congressional leaders to take action, writing a letter urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, to revive the national eviction moratorium for the rest of the pandemic. Congress approved $46 billion in rental assistance earlier in the pandemic, but the money has been slow to get to those who need it, with just $3 billion issued through June for rent, utilities and related expenses, according to U.S. Treasury data.

"McDonald's, others consider closing indoor seating amid Delta surge in U.S.",2858,"NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Some U.S. fast-food restaurants are closing indoor seating areas or limiting hours of operation because of the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, according to franchisees. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) had temporarily closed indoor dining at nearly all U.S. locations in early 2020, but it reopened 70% by last month. The global burger chain said on July 28 that it was on track to open nearly 100% by Labor Day - barring any COVID-19 resurgence. But last week, McDonald's instructed its franchisees on steps they should take to re-close their dining rooms in areas where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading, according to internal company materials seen by Reuters. ""We have a much deeper sense of what actions make a difference for the safety of our restaurant teams and crew,"" McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said during a Wednesday meeting, according to the materials. In Wednesday's conference call, McDonald's executives recommended franchisees consider closing indoor seating in counties where COVID cases exceed 250 per 100,000 people on a rolling three-week average. The materials did not specify how many locations have shut indoor seating or could soon do so. One McDonald's franchisee who operates multiple locations told Reuters it had to bar indoor seating at several restaurants. But expected closures are fewer than the number that shuttered in spring of 2020, when the pandemic first hit the United States. ""We’re monitoring the impact of the Delta variant closely and recently convened together with our franchisees to underscore existing safety protocols, reinforce our people first approach and provide updates on the rise in cases in the country,"" McDonald's Corp said in a statement on Friday. Top U.S. health officials said on Friday that U.S. cases of the coronavirus continue to rise amid the fast-spreading Delta variant. Vaccination rates were also higher, they said. Deaths and cases were up 11% and 3% respectively over the past seven days nationwide, with hospitalizations up 6% over the past week to an eight-month high, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. Drive-thru, carry-out and delivery helped fast-food sales rise this year despite shuttered dining rooms. But franchisees told Reuters that sales went up further when indoor seating reopened. PMTD Restaurants had to cut hours in a few of its nearly 40 KFC and Taco Bell (YUM.N) restaurants in Alabama and Georgia because they were short-staffed when several employees became infected with COVID-19, according to Bill Byrd, president of PMTD Restaurants. That impacts Taco Bell locations in particular, because closing at 8 p.m. instead of midnight or later means the restaurants lose late-night customers, who can make up 20% of business, Byrd said.

Biogen offers free Alzheimer's drug as Medicare payment uncertainty remains,4505,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) is providing its controversial and expensive new Alzheimer's drug free of charge for some patients amid slow claim reviews by Medicare, according to sources familiar with the situation, including a doctor treating patients with the drug. The development underscores the division among doctors about whether the $56,000-a-year drug helps patients and how uncertainty about reimbursement from Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for people over age 65, has held back prescriptions and sales. Aduhelm, which is given as a monthly infusion, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June even though one of Biogen's two large clinical trials failed to show a benefit for patients diagnosed with the incurable mind-wasting disease. In order to expedite treatment, Biogen has begun to provide Florida's First Choice Neurology with free-of-charge Aduhelm, according to Dr. Jeffrey Gelblum, a neurologist at the center's Aventura, Florida, operations. ""We have been using the Biogen access program - it is almost like a sample program - to get patients started,"" he told Reuters. Biogen has said it has a number of plans in place to support patient access, but did not give further details. Pharmaceutical companies can provide free medications through patient assistance programs, ""however we have never heard of that for an injectable, infused drug,"" Steven Lucio, vice president at Vizient Inc, which works with about half of U.S. hospitals to buy drugs, said in an email. James Chambers, a researcher at the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said providing free medications is a common strategy drugmakers use to boost patient prescription numbers. HOSPITALS SLOW TO USE A number of hospitals, as well as the Veterans Health Administration, have said there is not enough evidence to justify widespread use of Aduhelm. Several commercial insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest private insurer offering Medicare Advantage coverage to seniors, have said they are waiting for further direction from Medicare before covering the drug. ""Mainly because of the uncertainty around insurance coverage ... most doctors and systems are in a holding pattern,"" said Dr. Anton Porsteinsson, director of the University of Rochester Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program, which is only using Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab, on patients enrolled in clinical trials. A recent survey of 78 neurologists conducted by Morgan Stanley found that half were willing to prescribe Aduhelm, but nearly two-thirds don't think the FDA should have approved the drug. Just eight of the surveyed neurologists had prescribed Aduhelm and six of their Medicare claims had been paid as of early August. Florida's First Choice has so far infused more than 30 patients with Aduhelm, but only the first doses for two patients were billed to Medicare - their second doses, and first doses for the others, were provided at no cost by Biogen, Dr. Gelblum said. He said the clinic has been reimbursed by Medicare for the infusion component of claims, but not for the medication itself, although he expects that to happen within the next couple of weeks. Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people eligible for Aduhelm are covered by Medicare, which recently launched a nine-month process to determine standardized national coverage terms for the drug. For now, the government health plan is processing Aduhelm claims on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the medication itself, costs of administering Aduhelm include diagnostic testing for Alzheimer's and monitoring for side effects such as dangerous brain swelling. Experts say Medicare could seek to lower the therapy's cost to taxpayers by limiting access to the treatment, linking coverage to real-world evidence of patient outcomes, or setting a fixed payment that combines drug reimbursement with other costs related to the treatment. Aduhelm, developed in partnership with Japan's Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T), comes in two vial sizes of 300 milligrams (mg) and 170 mg. Patients are started out on a low dose, which is increased over time to the full dose of 10 mg per kg of a patient's weight. Sales of the drug are forecast to total $81 million this year, $1.3 billion next year and $5.8 billion by 2026, according to Wall Street analysts polled by Refinitiv.

New Zealand reports first death linked to Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,3860,"WELLINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported its first recorded death linked to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the health ministry said on Monday, after a woman suffered a rare heart muscle inflammation side effect. The report comes as the country battles an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus after nearly six months of being virus free. It followed a review by an independent panel monitoring the safety of the vaccines. ""This is the first case in New Zealand where a death in the days following vaccination has been linked to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine,"" the ministry said in a statement, without giving the woman's age. The vaccine monitoring panel attributed the death to myocarditis, a rare, but known, side effect of the Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine, the ministry added. The board said the myocarditis ""was probably due to vaccination"", according to the ministry. The health ministry said other medical issues at the same time could have influenced the outcome after vaccination. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms. Pfizer said it  recognised there could be rare reports of myocarditis after vaccinations, but such side effects were extremely rare. ""Pfizer takes adverse events that are potentially associated with our vaccine very seriously,"" the company said. ""The benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine continue to greatly outweigh the risk of both COVID-19 infection and vaccine side effects, including myocarditis,"" Pfizer said. A health worker draws a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine from a vial during a vaccination event hosted by Miami - Dade County and Miami Heat, at FTX Arena in Miami, Florida, U.S., August 5, 2021. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo Regulators in the United States, the European Union and the World Health Organization have said that mRNA vaccines from Pfizer with German partner BioNTech and by Moderna (MRNA.O) are associated with rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining around the heart, but that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks. The cases, affecting mainly younger men, tend to be mild and treatable but can lead to serious illness and hospitalization. There have been no U.S. deaths reported for young adults who developed myocarditis after being given the mRNA vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday. Separately, it also said that a total of 2,574 U.S. cases of myocarditis or pericarditis had been reported. More than 330 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been administered in the United States. The risk of myocarditis was 18.5 per million doses given among people aged 18 to 24 after their second Pfizer dose and 20.2 per million for that age group among Moderna second dose recipients. The risk decreases with age, according to the CDC analysis based on its national reporting system. The EU's drug regulator said on July 9 that five people had died due to the heart side effect after receiving either of the two mRNA vaccines in the European Economic Area, all of whom were elderly or had other diseases. More than 200 million mRNA doses have been administered in the region. New Zealand has provisionally approved use of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines, but only the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for rollout to the public. More than 3 million doses have been given so far, mostly to people over 50. New Zealand reported 53 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, taking its tally of infections in the current outbreak to 562, amid a nationwide lockdown enforced this month to limit spread of the Delta variant. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Defendants in U.S. Capitol attack have no attorney after lawyer contracts COVID-19: prosecutors,3344,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors said on Monday that 17 defendants who have been charged in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump have no attorney as John Pierce, the lawyer who has been representing them, is reportedly on a ventilator and unresponsive after contracting COVID-19. Prosecutors said in a filing in Washington, D.C. federal court that although Ryan Marshall, a Pierce Bainbridge associate and chief financial officer of Pierce's National Constitutional Law Union, has been acting in Pierce's stead, he is not a licensed attorney and cannot advise Pierce's clients. Marshall might not be able to obtain a bar license at all due to the criminal charges he is facing in Pennsylvania, prosecutors noted. Marshall was allegedly involved in a scheme to defraud a widow, according to an August 2020 Pittsburgh Tribune-Review report prosecutors cited. Marshall did not respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors made the filing in the case of Casey Cusick, 35, a Florida pastor facing charges relating to the Jan. 6 assault -- including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds -- and said the case was at a standstill from the government's perspective. Cusick, who has pleaded not guilty, could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors said since Marshall is not an attorney, it is not appropriate to communicate with him regarding Pierce's clients. ""Unfortunately, it seems that Mr. Pierce may be hospitalized and unable to communicate, and it is unclear when Mr. Pierce will recover,"" prosecutors said in their filing. It's unclear whether Pierce's firm Pierce Bainbridge is still operating. The firm saw a string of departures last year, which led to it shortening its name from Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht. The phone numbers for Pierce Bainbridge, as well as its only two partners, Pierce and Jim Bainbridge, were no longer in service as of Monday. The government noted there have been conflicting news reports about the exact status of Pierce's health. An NPR reporter on Wednesday said a friend of Pierce's told him Pierce did not have COVID-19 but was hospitalized due to ""dehydration and exhaustion."" That same reporter on Thursday said another source told him Pierce contracted COVID-19 but was not on a ventilator. Prosecutors said they have not had any contact with Pierce since Aug. 23. A prolific Twitter user, Pierce has not tweeted anything since Aug. 20, the government noted. Pierce has previously represented Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal lawyer, and Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old facing homicide charges stemming from protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

"Use of leaded petrol eliminated in 'milestone' for health, environment, U.N. says",2224,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Leaded petrol has been eliminated after the world's last remaining stocks were used up last month, the U.N.'s Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Monday, after heading a 19-year campaign to end use of the poisonous substance that poses major health and environment risks. Algeria, the only country still pumping leaded petrol into vehicles, exhausted its final stocks in July, UNEP said. The agency said the petrol contaminates air, soil and drinking water and can cause heart disease, stroke and cancer. Some studies have shown it harms brain development, especially in children. UNEP worked with governments, businesses and civic groups to eradicate leaded petrol and said ending its use after a century marked a ""huge milestone"". ""Leaded fuel illustrates in a nutshell the kind of mistakes humanity has been making at every level of our societies,"" Inger Anderson, UNEP executive director, told journalists. Those mistakes had driven climate change, pollution and a loss of biodiversity, she said, but the global response to lead in fuel shows that ""humanity can learn from and fix mistakes that we've made"". Lead's toxicity has been recognised since Roman times. It nevertheless began being added to gasoline in the early 1920s to make cars more powerful, and from then on was used in all petrol globally until the 1970s when wealthier countries began phasing it out. But in the early 2000s, 86 nations were still using leaded gasoline. The UNEP-led campaign was formed to help them move away from the fuel including by driving investment and overcoming concerns around prices, Anderson said. UNEP warned, however, that the transport industry remained a driver of climate-warming emissions, and 1.2 billion vehicles were set to hit the road in the coming decades. Antonio Guterres, U.N. Secretary General, said the elimination of leaded gasoline showed what could be achieved via collaboration, and called for similar initiatives towards emissions-free transport and tackling climate change. ""We must now turn the same commitment to... create a world of peace that works with nature, not against it,"" he said in a pre-recorded video. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. health department sets up climate change office,2306,"WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established an office to address climate change and health equity at the national level, Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Monday. The office aims to protect vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by pollution and climate-driven disasters, including drought and wildfires, he said. ""There is no doubt that America is experiencing climate change, and there is no reason for us to doubt that we must take this on immediately, because it's not just about the climate, it's not just about our environment. It's about our health."" Becerra spoke to reporters as Hurricane Ida knocked out power across Louisiana and Mississippi, killing at least one person and littering roads with downed power lines and debris. President Joe Biden declared major disasters and ordered federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in both states. Becerra declared public health emergencies there. Biden has made tackling the climate crisis domestically and abroad a key part of his agenda. He ordered in May the creation of a comprehensive government-wide climate-risk strategy within 120 days. Establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity is part of that strategy, Becerra said. The office will identify communities disproportionately exposed to climate hazards, address health disparities resulting from climate change, and help with regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare sector. Biden aims to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The health sector accounts for roughly 8.5% of U.S carbon emissions, and the global health sector accounts for around 4.5% of the world's emissions, said Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine. The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250,000 deaths annually. Dr. John Balbus, senior public health adviser to the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is interim director of the new office. Arsenio Mataka, formerly Becerra's environmental adviser when he was California attorney general, joined the department as senior adviser for climate change and health equity.

Class lawyers win reduced fee of $152 million in Sutter case,3818,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A California judge has slashed a requested legal fee award in an antitrust settlement with Sutter Health, approving $152.3 million in compensation for class counsel, after concluding the plaintiffs' lawyers had claimed ""unreasonably high"" hours for their work. Judge Anne-Christine Massullo of San Francisco Superior Court gave final approval to the $575 million settlement as she awarded fees to five law firms that represented plaintiff labor unions and employers, in an order released on Friday. Sutter Health in 2019 first agreed to the settlement resolving claims that anticompetitive practices led to higher healthcare costs in northern California. The awarded legal fee marked about 26% of the settlement, in line with compensation in other class actions, Massullo wrote. Massullo said her award accounted for the ""risk presented by this litigation"" and also ""the novelty and complexity of the issues."" The plaintiffs' lawyers had asked for $172.5 million in fees. A lead lawyer for the class, Richard Grossman of California's Pillsbury & Coleman, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Monday. The firms Farella Braun + Martel; Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll; Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick; and McCracken, Stemerman & Holsberry also represented the plaintiffs. Jones Day partner David Kiernan, a lawyer for Sutter, also did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Monday. Massullo's order awarded $11.5 million in fees to the California attorney general's office, which sued Sutter in 2018. The state's complaint was consolidated with the private litigation, which began in 2014. Massullo said the state attorneys and class lawyers ""demonstrated a high level of skill in providing high quality of representation in this case."" Still, the judge raised concerns about the number of hours -- 194,642 -- that class lawyers claimed in their request for fees. Massullo said the claimed hours compared to ""93.6 years of work, or more than 7 years of work for 13 attorneys."" Declarations from plaintiffs' attorneys involved in the case ""do not, except at a high level and very generally, permit assessment of the extent to which the five firms that constitute class counsel unreasonably duplicated efforts,"" Massullo said. Still, she said she was ""satisfied that this litigation was a monumental undertaking"" that required a ""vast number of hours."" Class named plaintiffs United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and Employers Benefit Trust objected to the requested legal fees as excessive. A lawyer for the union, Stephen Siegel, partner at Chicago's Novack and Macey, argued the assistance provided by the California attorney general's office should have reduced the fees paid to private lawyers.

"Lagging in COVID-19 vaccinations, Brussels takes vaccination campaign to shops",2219,"BRUSSELS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Health authorities in Brussels began offering COVID-19 jabs in supermarkets and shopping centres on Monday to increase vaccination rates in the Belgian capital that have not kept up with Belgium's rapid inoculation roll-out. Host to the European Union and NATO, Brussels has only given vaccinations to about 65% of its population, much lower than the surrounding Belgian regions, mainly because people did not respond to requests to go to vaccination centres. ""We're really trying to bring, as much as possible, the vaccine to the people,"" Inge Neven, crisis manager responsible for the COVID-19 response in Brussels, told Reuters. Belgium has recorded 25,360 deaths from the coronavirus, one of the world's highest tolls per capita. Neven said Brussels was home to 182 different nationalities, which made the job of reaching people to encourage them to go to a vaccination centre much harder. Within Brussels, vaccination is also lower in poorer neighbourhoods, even though many are just short walk from the steel and glass EU buildings and the leafy suburbs inhabited by diplomats and officials. ""We are selecting a number of areas where a lot of people are passing by and so we try really to offer them the vaccine at their place, in their environment, where they work, where they go to school, where they live, and also where they shop,"" she said. One shopper, who gave her name as Esther, said the vaccination points near supermarket check-outs had helped her overcome her fears about having a needle in her arm. ""I didn't want to but I've changed my mind,"" she said. ""Before I didn't want to because I was afraid, but now I have seen other people taking it who feel better, people in my family who've had it and it hasn't been a problem, so I decided to get one too,"" she added. Others worry that Belgium will follow neighbouring France and require proof of vaccination to be able to go into cinemas and cafes. ""I didn't want to do it (get vaccinated). I didn't want to do it but as it's going to become like it is in France, to go into a restaurant you have to show your pass, now I'm doing it,"" another shopper Rudi Jacquet said.

U.S. pending home sales drop for second straight month in July,2384,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes declined for the second consecutive month in July in step with limited supply that's been unable to keep up with demand from potential homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 1.8% after dropping a revised 2.0% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would increase 0.4%. Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later. ""The market may be starting to cool slightly, but at the moment there is not enough supply to match the demand from would-be buyers,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Inventory is slowly increasing and home shoppers should begin to see more options in the coming months."" Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply, with the median price for new single-family homes now topping $390,000 and for existing homes just under $360,000. Compared with one year ago, pending home sales were down 8.5%. ""The highly competitive real estate market we saw in the first six months of 2021 squeezed available inventory to record-lows and pushed prices to new highs just as summer emerged, leaving many first-time buyers feeling frustrated,"" said George Ratiu, manager of economic research for Realtor.com. ""However, in a noticeable shift, homeowners responded to market trends and started listing homes in larger numbers."" Only the West region posted a month-over-month gain in contract activity in July, while the Midwest, Northeast and the South all reported declines. All four regions saw transactions decrease on a year-over-year basis. ""Homes listed for sale are still garnering great interest, but the multiple, frenzied offers – sometimes double-digit bids on one property – have dissipated in most regions,"" Yun said. ""Even in a somewhat calmer market, a number of potential buyers are still choosing to waive appraisals and inspections.""

German Social Democrats power ahead in latest setback for Merkel's conservatives,3174,"BERLIN, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) extended their lead over Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in the latest poll published on Monday, increasing the chances of a left-leaning coalition government following a general election next month. The Insa poll for Bild TV showed support for the SPD and their chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz jump by 2 percentage points to 25%, the highest reading in the survey in four years. Merkel's conservatives and their top candidate Armin Laschet lost 3 points to reach a record low at 20%. The ecologist Greens stood at 16.5%, the business-friendly FDP at 13.5%, the far-right AfD at 11% and far-left Die Linke at 7%. Insa head Hermann Binkert said Laschet could currently only become chancellor with a three-way 'Jamaica coalition' consisting of the black conservatives, the Greens and the yellow FDP. ""Olaf Scholz would have four options in which to lead the government,"" Binkert added. This included a so-called ""traffic light"" coalition with the Greens and the FDP and a more left-leaning coalition with the Greens and Die Linke. Another possibility would be an SPD-led coalition government supported by the Greens and conservatives, or an SPD-led coalition supported by the conservatives and the FPD. The conservatives rallied behind Laschet, promising to go on the offensive after he struggled to revive their campaign in a televised debate with rivals. Laschet, leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), was judged to have lost the heated televised debate with his two main rivals on Sunday, a snap poll suggested, as surveys showed his party falling behind the SPD. Laschet has been under fire since he was caught on camera laughing during a visit last month to a flood-stricken town, but senior party officials praised his combative style in Sunday's debate even if it did not immediately appear to win over voters. ""We have to fight for the next four weeks,"" Jens Spahn, a Laschet ally and CDU health minister, told Bild TV, rejecting suggestions that the conservative alliance should drop Laschet in favour of Bavarian conservative Markus Soeder. ""You don't change the coach during the game,"" Spahn said. The CDU's slide marks a remarkable fall for the party after 16 years in office and four straight national election victories under Merkel, who plans to step down after the election. Soeder, who earlier this year ran against Laschet to be the conservative chancellor candidate, said his erstwhile rival had laid a good foundation for the next three-way debate in two weeks. ""From my point of view, this was exactly what we had hoped for to give us new momentum,"" Soeder told reporters in Munich. ""It also motivates our own election campaigners."" Laschet on Monday brushed off the post-debate snap poll, which showed that of voters surveyed by pollster Forsa, 36% believed SPD candidate Olaf Scholz won, ahead of 30% for Greens candidate Annalena Baerbock and 25% for Laschet. Scholz is the most popular of the candidates in the polls. Despite the SPD's lead, they would still need to team up with two other parties to govern.

Planning for shifting merger enforcement under the new administration,8401,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 30, 2021 - New leadership at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have expressed strong concerns that prior administrations did not vigorously enforce the antitrust laws and failed to prevent widespread consolidation in many industries. They believe this lack of enforcement has led to higher prices for consumers and reduced wages for workers, curbed economic growth and innovation, and curtailed opportunities for small and independent companies. These views are also reflected in President Biden's recent Executive Order on Promoting Competition that asks the antitrust agencies to step up their enforcement of the antitrust laws and reduce corporate consolidation. What does all this mean for companies considering growth through strategic acquisitions? They should plan for a broader range of outcomes — in types of questions to be ready to address, in timing, and in divestitures needed to assure a closing — before entering into a merger agreement. At a minimum, a government review of proposed mergers is likely to take longer and to cover a broader array of issues. The current administration is also more likely to pursue enforcement actions against proposed mergers, especially for mergers in Big Tech, health care, and agriculture, industries targeted by the President as areas of concern. The first announced salvo regarding heightened review of proposed mergers occurred in early February when the Acting Chair of the FTC announced that the agency would be reassessing its long-established internal processes and procedures for reviewing merger filings. At the same time, the FTC ""temporarily"" suspended its power to grant early termination to the required 30-day waiting period for transactions that pose no credible antitrust concern. More than six months later, this temporary suspension remains in effect with no end in sight even for proposed mergers that do not even remotely raise competitive issues. The FTC and DOJ, which share responsibility for enforcing the antitrust laws, also announced immediately after the President's Executive Order in July that they are rewriting their joint merger guidelines that they use to investigate and challenge mergers. These bipartisan guidelines, last revised in 2010 under President Obama for horizontal mergers (mergers among current and potential competitors) and in 2020 under President Trump for vertical mergers (mergers among firms that provide different supply chain functions), are the government's well-established playbook for determining whether a merger is illegal. The FTC Chair and acting head of the DOJ's Antitrust Division stated that they plan to revise the merger guidelines to counter years of ""overly permissive"" merger enforcement as part of a broader effort to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws. Lina Khan, the new Chair of the FTC, and Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, have each stated their intention to ramp up merger enforcement. The revised merger guidelines are likely to include new areas of concern such as the impact of a merger on workers' wages, whether small and independent companies may be adversely affected, and whether underrepresented groups may be disadvantaged. These issues will be in addition to bedrock antitrust issues that include higher prices or reduced quality for consumers. The staff at the FTC and DOJ, under guidance from the new leaders, are already broadening their typical in-depth investigations to cover the new playbook of issues. The revised merger guidelines are also likely to capture mergers with lower combined market shares than the standards in the current set of merger guidelines. For example, mergers with a combined market share below 30% will likely face a more in-depth investigation than in the past and a higher likelihood of being challenged by the government. The guidelines are also likely to offer clearer guidance regarding acquisitions of potential or nascent competitors and ""killer acquisitions"" of up-start companies that could independently develop into meaningful competitors. The FTC and DOJ more recently have been focusing on these types of acquisitions in the high technology and life sciences sectors, and the revised guidelines may specifically address the conditions under which these mergers will be challenged. The agencies, however, are not waiting to issue revised merger guidelines before increasing their enforcement actions. When Aon attempted its $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson, their agreement to divest certain assets satisfied concerns expressed by the European Commission, which subsequently approved the merger. The Department of Justice, however, rejected the parties' divestiture offer to resolve issues in the United States and in June sued to block the merger. The parties subsequently terminated the merger and Aon had to pay a $1 billion reverse break fee to Willis Towers Watson pursuant to the merger agreement. The FTC also announced in early August a new and unprecedented policy of issuing letters warning companies that their mergers will remain under continuous scrutiny. Under this new policy, the FTC is informing these companies that due to the ""tidal wave"" of merger filings, the agency can no longer fully investigate all deals during the required statutory deadlines by issuing standard requests for additional information. Although the companies can merge due to the expiration of the required waiting period, the continuous-scrutiny letter states they are doing so ""at their own risk"" because the FTC may later challenge the merger after its consummation. This new FTC policy may not prevent companies from closing their mergers, especially those where the companies are contractually obligated to close after the expiration of the required waiting period, but it does add uncertainty to the 40-year merger review process. The FTC has provided no further guidance on its new policy. At this time, no one knows how many companies are receiving warning letters, how long these ongoing investigations may last, and if in fact the FTC is going to sue to challenge any of these mergers. The FTC and DOJ, however, cannot unilaterally stop a proposed merger or order companies to unwind a consummated merger. To stop a proposed merger, the agencies must seek injunctive relief in federal court where there are many precedents that provide strong guard rails against overly aggressive merger enforcement. Likewise, the FTC and DOJ cannot block or unwind a merger absent a trial at which the government has the burden to demonstrate that the merger is unlawful. Companies seeking mergers may need to consider more seriously the prospects of litigation to ultimately close their mergers or potentially the need for additional or unexpected divestitures. Companies should also be mindful of their obligations in their merger agreements, which cover both buyers' and sellers' required efforts to close a merger, including divestiture and litigation commitments, timing for the outside closing date, and prospects for a reverse break fee in the event the merger does not close. It will be important to plan in advance to address quickly the full playbook of new questions that may arise. Strategic growth through M&A will continue but will require more advanced planning to ensure closing under conditions that are commercially acceptable. Opinions expressed are those of the author.

"Afghanistan's healthcare system near collapse, aid agencies warn",2776,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's healthcare system is at risk of collapse, two major aid agencies told Reuters, after foreign donors stopped providing aid following the Taliban takeover. After the United States withdraw the bulk of its remaining troops last month, the Taliban accelerated its military campaign, taking control of the capital Kabul on Aug. 15. International donors including the World Bank and European Union froze funding to Afghanistan shortly afterwards. ""One of the great risks for the health system here is basically to collapse because of lack of support,"" said Filipe Ribeiro, Afghanistan representative for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), one of the largest medical aid agencies in the country. ""The overall health system in Afghanistan is understaffed, under-equipped and underfunded, for years. And the great risk is that this underfunding will continue over time."" Necephor Mghendi, Afghanistan head of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC), said the healthcare system, which was already fragile and heavily reliant on foreign aid, had been left under additional strain. ""The humanitarian needs on the ground are massive,"" he said. INCREASED DEMAND Both aid agencies said that while their ground operations were broadly unaffected, they had seen a significant increase in demand as other facilities are unable to fully function. Mghendi said closures of Afghan banks had meant almost all humanitarian agencies have been unable to access funds, leaving vendors and staff unpaid. Compounding the issue, medical supplies will now need to be restocked earlier than expected. ""Supplies that were supposed to last for three months will not be able to last three months. We may need to replenish much earlier than that,"" Mghendi said. Ribeiro said MSF had stockpiled medical supplies before the takeover but that with flights disrupted and land borders in disarray, it was unclear when more might reach the country. The World Health Organization said on Monday that a plane carrying 12.5 tonnes of medicines and health supplies had landed at Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, the first such shipment since the Taliban took control. read more During its period in power from 1996-2001, the Islamist militant Taliban had an uneasy relationship with foreign aid agencies, eventually expelling many, including MSF, in 1998. This time, the group has said it welcomes foreign donors, and will protect the rights of foreign and local staff - a commitment that has so far been upheld, Ribeiro said. ""They actually ask us to stay, and they asked us to keep running our operations the way we were running them before,"" he said. ""The relations are, so far, pretty reassuring.""

Food for thought? Nestle taps students and startups in R&D drive,1116,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Food group Nestle (NESN.S) inaugurated the biggest site for its ""R&D Accelerator"" programme on Monday, aiming to work with startups and students to speed the development of new products. The food industry has to be nimble to keep pace with consumers increasingly concerned about their health and the planet, who want to eat products with less meat, salt, sugar and fat, and made from natural, locally sourced ingredients. Launched in 2019, Nestle's R&D Accelerator programme has 12 sites in eight countries so far. The site inaugurated on Monday, in the Swiss city of Lausanne, can host 20 projects per year.

Czechs to offer booster vaccine shot to all after eight months,1444,"PRAGUE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Czech government will offer a booster COVID-19 vaccine shot from Sept. 20 to any previously vaccinated person, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Monday. The Czech Republic, a country of 10.7 million, has been one of the countries worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as measured by deaths per population, with over 30,400 victims. Nearly 1.68 million Czechs have contracted the virus, and many more are estimated to have caught it without being tested. The government's coronavirus task force said on Twitter that the boosters were strongly recommended for people over 60 but would also be available for all who had completed previous vaccinations, either by a two-dose or single-dose schemes. The government will use Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for the boosters for those who completed a regular vaccination at least eight months earlier, Vojtech told a news conference shown live on television. As of Monday, 5.73 million people have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, mostly from Pfizer/BioNTech, and another 197,254 received the one-dose vaccine made by Johnson and Johnson. Separately, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Czech Television the government will offer financial bonuses to general practitioners who convince more people over 65 to undergo initial vaccinations, to boost the vaccination rate among the oldest citizens.

Theranos founder claims abuse by ex-boyfriend in fraud trial -court filings,2551,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Theranos Inc founder Elizabeth Holmes has accused her former boyfriend, who was president of the blood-testing startup, of abusing her, court documents unsealed on Saturday showed, hinting at a possible defense strategy with jury selection in her fraud trial set to start next week. In court filings submitted more than 18 months ago, Holmes' lawyers said they planned to present evidence that Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically in a relationship that spanned more than a decade. That includes the period when the company claimed its technology could enable a wide array of medical tests with a few drops of blood. Theranos, which Holmes founded in 2003 at the age of 19, collapsed in March 2018 when she, Balwani and the $9 billion company were charged with fraud by U.S. regulators. Theranos had made Holmes, a Stanford University dropout, a Silicon Valley star. In the filings Holmes' lawyers argued that the alleged ""intimate partner abuse"" was relevant to the question of whether she knew that financial information provided to investors and others was false. Holmes intends to blame Balwani, alleging he exerted controlled over her through the abusive relationship, the filings indicate. Balwani, whose case is being handled separately, has denied the allegations. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes arrives at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building to attend a federal court hearing in San Jose, California, U.S. May 4, 2021. REUTERS/Kate Munsch ""Mr. Balwani unequivocally denies that he engaged in any abuse at any time,"" his lawyers wrote in a December 2019 filing. Holmes and Balwani have both pleaded not guilty to charges that they defrauded investors, doctors and patients by falsely claiming Theranos could revolutionize medical lab testing with its technology. Lawyers at Williams & Connolly for Holmes and attorneys for Balwani at Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe could not immediately be reached for comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Schenk, the lead prosecutor on the case, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

"King lauds Osaka for mental health stand, calls it 'fantastic progress'",2722,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Tennis great Billie Jean King has praised Naomi Osaka for speaking out on mental health issues and her stand against racial injustice. Japan's Osaka withdrew from this year's French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to do media duties, which she said had contributed to the depression issues she had struggled with for years. The 23-year-old, a four-times Grand Slam champion, also pulled out of Wimbledon, leading to a broader conversation about mental health in sport. Osaka was joined by King, mercurial Australian Nick Kyrgios and former American player Mardy Fish for a discussion hosted by Racquet Magazine on the eve of the U.S. Open. ""Everyone loves you guys. They listen to you guys, and I think it's great when you talk and talk about your feelings. Kids need that,"" King, a leading figure in the campaign for gender equality in tennis, told Osaka. ""When I was outed in '81 for being gay, I lost everything in 24 hours. You guys can talk about these things and you're celebrated. Other people have the same issues. But we couldn't talk about it the way you get to. ""Every time I go to any place now I have to talk about mental health. Why? Because you guys talked about it. That's fantastic progress."" The 77-year-old has in the past likened Osaka's off-court stance to that of the Original Nine, a group of players led by King who fought tirelessly to start a professional women's tennis tour, which led to the creation of the WTA in 1973. Osaka was lauded for supporting the ""Black Lives Matter"" campaign as she highlighted racial injustice by wearing different face masks at her 2020 U.S. Open matches bearing the names of African Americans who died in recent years. ""After my first Slam, I was supposed to be the good girl,"" Osaka said. ""But now that I'm talking about stuff that bothers me, I think it's confusing a lot of people. I honestly don't know what people think about me."" In a social media post on Sunday, Osaka said she intends to celebrate her own achievements more and will not worry about the expectations others place on her as she prepares to begin her U.S. Open title defence. read more Kyrgios, who has been punished by authorities for his on-court behaviour, said he did not feel the media cared about players' well-being. But King, who won 12 Grand Slam singles titles, said the sport's finiancial strength would not have been possible without the support of the press. ""In our generation we played for $14 a day and we played for more than ourselves,"" she said. ""We only had the traditional media. So if we don't get them to tell our story then we wouldn't have what we have today."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
WHO opens air bridge to Afghanistan with medical supplies,1482,"GENEVA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A plane carrying World Health Organization medicines and health supplies landed in Afghanistan on Monday, the UN health agency said, the first shipment to get in since the country came under the control of the Taliban. ""After days of non-stop work to find a solution, I am very pleased to say that we have now been able to partially replenish stocks of health facilities in Afghanistan and ensure that — for now – WHO-supported health services can continue,"" Ahmed Al Mandhari, WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, said in a statement. The WHO had warned on Friday that medical supplies would run out within days in Afghanistan, announcing that it hoped to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by then with the help of Pakistani authorities. The 12.5 tonnes of supplies that arrived on Monday consist of trauma kits and emergency health kits, enough to cover the basic health needs of more than 200,000 people as well as provide 3,500 surgical procedures and treat 6,500 trauma patients, the WHO said. They will be delivered to 40 health facilities in 29 provinces across Afghanistan, it added. The plane, which was provided by the government of Pakistan, flew from Dubai to Mazar-i-Sharif airport. It was the first of three flights planned with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to fill urgent shortages in medicines and medical supplies in Afghanistan.

U.S. says Brooklyn woman who aided Islamic State is arrested after skipping hearing,1912,"NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A Brooklyn woman who faces a resentencing for supporting Islamic State but skipped a court hearing because she feared being sent back to prison has been arrested in New Mexico, U.S. prosecutors said. Sinmyah Amera Ceasar, who prosecutors said used the name ""Umm Nutella"" in her role as a ""committed recruiter"" for Islamic State, was arrested on Friday afternoon by FBI agents following a nationwide search, prosecutors said in a letter on Sunday. Ceasar, 26, had missed a scheduled appearance in Brooklyn federal court on Aug. 25, one week after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan threw out what it called her ""shockingly low"" four-year prison term and ordered her resentenced. read more In their letter to U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, prosecutors said Ceasar, when she was arrested, did not have the GPS ankle bracelet she was supposed to wear, and before fleeing had told others she ""expected to be sent to prison"" at the Aug. 25 conference. Prosecutors also said Ceasar should remain in federal custody, given that ""there is no longer any conceivable argument that she is not a risk of flight."" Federal public defenders who represent Ceasar were not immediately available on Monday for comment. Ceasar had received her four-year term in 2019 from late U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who cited her need for educational and mental health support after a lifetime of abuse. In throwing out that sentence, the appeals court called it too short relative to ""similar terrorism crimes"" and did not ensure just punishment. read more Ceasar had been out of prison since July 2020, having received credit for time served. She was originally arrested in November 2016, began cooperating with prosecutors, and pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

Saudi students return to school with masks and checks,1916,"RIYADH, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Waleed Saleh grinned behind his face mask in the corridor of Riyadh's Ibn al-Hajeb elementary school, enjoying his first chance to see all of his classmates in more than a year. ""It has been a while,"" the 13-year-old said as his friends headed to lessons around him, wearing white robes and leather sandals and carrying black backpacks. A sign in the courtyard outside wished them all a ""warm welcome back"". Around 6 million students returned to classes in the kingdom this week for the first time since the start of the pandemic after data suggested infections were stabilising and fatalities falling. But authorities are keeping cautious. Children older than 12 have to show they have been vaccinated before they can return. At Ibn al-Hajeb, a security guard checked all the children's temperature after their parents dropped them off at the gate. The pupils then lined up, standing on marked spots in the courtyard before processing in. ""School breaks and activities involving physical proximity have been cancelled,"" school manager Hassan al-Fefe told Reuters. Pupils have to keep their distance during the day - the children sit far apart on blue tables. But the return was still something to celebrate, Waleed and his friends said.

"India's COVID vaccine supply jumps, raising export hopes",3287,"NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India's rising output of COVID-19 vaccines and the inoculation of more than half its adult population with at least one dose are raising hopes the country will return as an exporter within months, ramping up from early next year. After donating or selling 66 million doses to nearly 100 countries, India barred exports in the middle of April to focus on domestic immunisation as infections exploded, upsetting the inoculation plans of many African and South Asian countries. India's daily vaccinations surpassed 10 million doses on Friday, with national vaccine production more than doubling since April and set to rise again in the coming weeks. New production lines have been set up, a vaccine developed by Cadila Healthcare (CADI.NS) won recent approval, and commercial production of Russia's Sputnik V is starting in India. The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, is now producing about 150 million doses a month of its version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shot, more than twice its April output of about 65 million, a source with knowledge of the matter said. ""No fixed timeline on exports but the company hopes to restart in a few months,"" said the source, who declined to be named without approval to talk on the matter. SII, which has previously indicated exports could resume by year-end, did not respond to a request for comment. Global vaccine sharing platform COVAX hopes India will restart foreign sales sooner than later. ""With successful national vaccination and the arrival of more products, we are hoping that Indian supply to COVAX will resume as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson for the platform's co-lead GAVI told Reuters in an email. India, a major international producer of many other vaccines, could play a ""similarly transformative role in the global response to COVID-19,"" the spokesperson said. India's health ministry and the foreign ministry, which coordinates vaccine exports, did not respond to a request for comment. Bharat Biotech, the maker of India's first domestically developed COVID-19 shot, on Sunday inaugurated a new factory with a production capacity of 10 million doses a month. It said it was ""marching towards"" a goal of a total annual capacity of about 1 billion doses of the drug, Covaxin. read more Infections, meanwhile, are again rising in India after an explosive outbreak in April and May. But the country has administered more than 633 million vaccine doses, with at least one dose to 52% of its 944 million adults and two doses to more than 15%. A government source told Reuters in June the U.S. experience showed that vaccinations tend to slow down after a big majority of people get their shots. That might give SII a chance to export excess output, said the source. The chief of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party said this month India could produce as many as 1.1 billion vaccine doses between September and December, enough to fully immunise all adults in the country this year. read more India has so far given emergency authorisation to six COVID-19 shots, four of which are being produced locally.

Toyota to restart self-driving Olympic village vehicles with more safety staff,1950,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor (7203.T) said on Monday it would resume operations of its self-driving e-Palette pods at the Tokyo Paralympic Games village with greater operator control and more safety staff to ensure they did not hit any more people. The e-Palettes were halted after one of the vehicles collided with and injured a visually impaired Japanese athlete at a junction last week, prompting a YouTube video apology from Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda. ""The vehicle's sensor detected the pedestrian crossing and activated the automatic brake, and the operator also activated the emergency brake. The vehicle and pedestrians, however, came into contact before it came to a complete halt,"" Toyota said in a statement on Monday. Aramitsu Kitazono was not seriously injured in the incident, but had to pull out of the Games judo event on Saturday because of cuts and bruises, further embarrassing the Japanese company, which along with other global automakers is trying to develop autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads. The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly. Operators will now be given control over how fast the vehicles travel with two safety staff members, rather than one, on board to look out for pedestrians, a Toyota spokesperson said. Warning sounds on e-Palettes will also be turned up and pedestrian guides at busy crossings in the athletes village will also be increased to 20 from six said the company, which is cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident.

"New Zealand's Auckland stays in lockdown, officials report Pfizer-linked death",2777,"WELLINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday extended a lockdown in Auckland by two weeks, while officials reported the country's first death linked to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. New Zealand had been largely virus-free for months, barring a small number of cases in February, until an outbreak of the Delta variant imported from Australia prompted Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. Infections in the outbreak have reached 562 but the number of daily new cases dropped to 53 on Monday, the lowest over the past five days. ""I know we all feel encouraged that our number is lower than what we've seen in the last few days and I know we're all willing for that trend to remain,"" Ardern said at a news conference. ""The job is not yet done and we do need to keep going."" Around 1.7 million Aucklanders will remain in strict level 4 lockdown for another two weeks, while restrictions for the remainder of the country will be eased slightly to a level 3. Ardern's tough and swift lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, were credited with reining in COVID-19 in the country. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Around 21% of the population of 5.1 million people have been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. VACCINE DEATH The health ministry on Monday announced a woman had died due to myocarditis, which is known to be a rare side effect of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N) (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms. The health ministry did not provide the woman's age. Pfizer in New Zealand did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. read more Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the risk of myocarditis after the vaccine was a lot lower than risk of myocarditis after being infected with COVID-19. ""And that's part of the reason we've been very open about this case,"" Bloomfield said. ""It's of great interest internationally as well because it's one of the few cases where we've got the full range of evidence around the side effects and then been able to explain this death."" New Zealand has provisionally approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines, but only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for rollout to the public.

Russia sees possible increase in West Nile virus cases this autumn,1250,"MOSCOW, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Russia warned on Monday of a possible increase in West Nile virus infections this autumn as mild temperatures and heavy precipitation create favourable conditions for the mosquitos that carry it. Originally from Africa, the virus has spread in Europe, Asia and North America. It is mainly transmitted through mosquito bites and can lead to a fatal neurological disease in humans, although most people infected never develop any symptoms. Scientists have said that milder temperatures attributed to climate change could cause diseases such as the West Nile virus to become more widespread. ""In light of favourable climatic conditions this year - an abundance of precipitation... a warm and long autumn, a high number of (virus) carriers could be observed in the autumn,"" Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer health watchdog, said. The virus causes West Nile fever in around 20% of cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. It is related to the Zika, dengue and yellow fever viruses. More than 80% of Russia's West Nile fever cases are recorded in its southwest region. There is no vaccine against the virus in humans although one exists for horses, the WHO says.

Jenner taps DWT partners for antitrust practice co-leads,3501,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Jenner & Block announced on Monday it has brought aboard a pair of Davis Wright Tremaine partners as new co-leaders of its antitrust and competition law practice. Chris Renner will co-lead the practice from Chicago while Doug Litvack will co-lead from Washington, D.C. They'll head the practice alongside a third partner, D.C.-based Lee Van Voorhis, who joined Jenner in 2016. Both Renner and Litvack had prior roles in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau. Prior to joining Davis Wright Tremaine in April 2020, Renner was a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner. Litvack had associate roles at Jones Day and McDermott Will & Emery prior to joining Davis Wright Tremaine in 2018. Renner and Litvack described themselves as full-service antitrust litigators, with Renner mostly representing plaintiffs and Litvack representing defendants in antitrust actions. Litvack and Renner were among the Davis Wright Tremaine attorneys defending Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica Health Systems Inc in court over its ability to cancel contracts with Ohio-based hospital McLaren St. Luke's. St. Luke's this week asked the full 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a three-judge panel's ruling siding with ProMedica. ""We have this diversified, complementary focus,"" Renner said. A representative for Davis Wright Tremaine did not respond to a request for comment. Their move to Jenner comes as the Biden administration has been stepping up antitrust enforcement. Last month, the president signed a sweeping executive order that urged agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. Meanwhile, the administration added more detail to its lawsuit against Facebook Inc, once again asking a judge to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. A federal judge dismissed the FTC's first lawsuit against Facebook in June. ""I don’t think it’s any great shock to say we’re in an antitrust moment in our country unlike any I’ve seen in my 25-year career. Antitrust is in the spotlight like it hasn’t been in that timeline,"" said Van Voorhis. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Latham & Watkins, Mayer Brown, Shearman & Sterling, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati have all added Justice Department and FTC alumni in recent months. Renner and Litvack said they expect most of their antitrust clients to come over with them.

Australian state warns COVID-19 hospitalisations to peak in October,2970,"CANBERRA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Intensive care cases in Australia's New South Wales will hit a peak in October as COVID-19 infections accumulate, said the premier of the country's most populous state, which reported record daily new infections on Monday. New South Wales, the epicentre of Australia's current outbreak, declared a record 1,290 new cases as the nation struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the state was preparing for additional hospitalisations as infections pile up, before increased vaccination coverage starts to ease the pressure. ""We anticipate that the worst month, the worst time for our intensive care unit will be in October,"" Berejiklian said in the state capital Sydney. ""We will need to manage things differently because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but we will cope."" There are 840 people in hospital for COVID-19 in New South Wales, with 137 in intensive care and 48 requiring ventilation. The state reported four additional fatalities on Monday, taking the COVID-19 death toll to 1,003 in Australia, the last of the Group of 20 big economies to exceed that milestone. read more A lone woman, wearing a protective face mask, walks across an unusually quiet city centre bridge on the first day of a lockdown as the state of Victoria looks to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Melbourne, Australia, July 16, 2021. REUTERS/Sandra Sanders One of the four was the first known death of an Aboriginal person. The 50-year-old man, who was not vaccinated, lived in western NSW where vaccination rates are particularly low, raising fears there will be many more deaths there. ""Aboriginal people were deemed to be vulnerable communities, vulnerable groups in the vaccine rollout. And clearly that has failed,"" Linda Burney, Labour's Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, told reporters. Nationwide, a record 1,375 new COVID-19 cases were reported. Australia has used a system of strict lockdowns and quarantine to keep coronavirus infection and death rates lower than in most comparable nations, however the Delta variant is now pressuring health services. Just over 33% of those aged 16 and older have received two vaccine doses, well below most comparable nations, according to government data. The delays were partly because of changed health advice over the use of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine, which was to be the backbone of the country's immunisation programme, after rare cases of blood clots among some recipients. The pace of vaccination in Australia has since risen to a seven-day average of more than 250,000 doses a day, the fastest rate ever, according to a Reuters analysis. Australia's second-most populous state, Victoria, reported 73 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, a day after Premier Dan Andrews said he would extend lockdown measures as daily infections reached the highest in a year.

Electric-car crash is double pain for Evergrande,3192,"HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It doesn’t take many bits malfunctioning in a traditional car to bring it to a screeching halt. So too with Evergrande’s (3333.HK) electric car dreams. The indebted Chinese property developer has seen the market value of its auto unit plummet 90% since an April peak to just $10 billion. Investors are left with a hodge-podge of assets whose survival as a business relies on Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan staying on course. Read the announcements of Evergrande New Energy Vehicle (0708.HK), also known as Evergrande Auto, and it is progressing towards its goal of becoming the world’s largest and most powerful electric vehicle enterprise. Under the hood however it is mostly a healthcare business ranging from hospital joint ventures to health-focused property developments. That’s the engine onto which it began bolting electric car deals in 2018. Investments there will help double the overall year-on-year first-half net loss to about $740 million, the company warned this month. The real damage has been caused by its parent and 65% shareholder. In May, Evergrande sold $1.4 billion of Auto’s shares and says it could sell more. Chinese regulators have publicly ordered Evergrande to get its debt under control. Auto’s 2020 accounts being presented as a going concern relied on extending the term of an existing loan from its parent, a one-year letter of support from its parent, plus capital raisings that brought in Tencent (0700.HK) and Sequoia among others. Market perceptions matter enormously to cash-guzzling early-stage companies whose high valuations underpin regular share sales to fund heavy spending. A planned Shanghai listing for Auto appears stalled, while Hui’s efforts to get it included in the stock connect have been overtaken by rivals Xpeng (9868.HK) and Li Auto , , both of which listed in Hong Kong recently and are poised to join the powerful system which allows mainland investors to buy the city’s shares directly. Hui has a track record of finding an extra gear and bolstering his companies’ shares just when the going gets dicey, but Auto’s high value was also a hoped-for crutch for his flagship property developer. Instead, this car crash represents double pain. Follow @JennHughes13 on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Shares in Hong Kong-listed Evergrande New Energy Vehicle, also known as Evergrande Auto, have fallen 90% from an April peak which valued the company at $87 billion. The company warned on Aug. 9 that its first-half net loss would double due to the cost of its electric vehicle business, which is in an early investment phase. Breakingviews

"Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New Orleans",6348,"NEW ORLEANS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida plowed into Louisiana from the Gulf of Mexico as a fierce Category 4 storm on Sunday, lashing the coast with 150 mile-per-hour winds, torrential downpours and pounding surf that submerged much of the shoreline under several feet of water. Power was knocked out Sunday night to the entire New Orleans metropolitan area with the failure of all eight transmission lines that deliver electricity to Louisiana's largest city, the utility company Entergy Louisiana reported. One transmission tower collapsed into the Mississippi River, according to the Jefferson Parish Emergency Management Department. U.S. President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in Louisiana, ordering federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in more than two-dozen storm-stricken parishes. Ida slammed ashore around noon near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a hub of the Gulf's offshore energy industry, blasting the coast with hurricane-force winds extending 50 miles (80 km) out from the eye of the storm. Landfall came 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina, one of the most catastrophic on record, struck the Gulf Coast. Sunday night, the sheriff's office in Ascension Parish reported the first known U.S. fatality from the storm - a 60-year-old man killed by a tree falling on his home near Baton Rouge, the state capital. Flash flooding was reported by the National Hurricane Center across southeastern Louisiana. Nearly all offshore Gulf oil production was suspended, and major ports along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts were closed to shipping. read more Residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days in advance of Ida. Those riding out the storm in their homes in New Orleans, less than 100 miles inland to the north, braced for the toughest test yet of major upgrades to a levee system constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from Katrina. read more ""I almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of Katrina,"" Janet Rucker, a lifelong New Orleans resident and recently retired sales manager who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog, Deuce. ""This is just not good for our nerves and our psyche."" The storm's approach forced the suspension of emergency medical services in New Orleans and elsewhere across a state already reeling from a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections that has strained Louisiana's healthcare system. For an estimated 2,450 COVID-19 patients hospitalized statewide, many in intensive care units, evacuation was not an option. A loss of generator power at the Thibodaux Regional Health System hospital in Lafourche Parish, southwest of New Orleans, forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor, the state Health Department confirmed to Reuters. Farren Clark, a Nicholls State University professor who studied Katrina's impact and was riding out the storm at his mother's home in Thibodaux, called the arrival of Ida ""nerve-wracking."" ""I can hear the howl of the storm getting stronger,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""Having done research on Katrina, it is a little bit triggering."" Michael Lewis, 45, restaurant owner in nearby Houma, said he could see shingles blown off his roof and a downed fence through a window of his home but was unable to check the full extent of damage as the storm raged. A parking sign lies in the street as Hurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana, in New Orleans, Louisiana, August 29, 2021. REUTERS/Marco Bello ""It's way too dangerous to go outside right now,"" he said in a phone interview. Officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said they expected the city's newly reinforced levees to hold, though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places. ""This is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times,"" Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a news briefing. Hundreds of miles of new levees were built around New Orleans after flooding from Katrina inundated much of the low-lying city, especially historically Black neighborhoods. That monster storm claimed more than 1,800 lives. Edwards voiced confidence in the $14.5 billion in levee improvements since then, saying they were ""built for this moment."" WIDESPREAD OUTAGES Power outages were widespread in the first hours of the storm, with more than 1 million Louisiana homes and businesses losing electricity by late Sunday night, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.US. Just three days after emerging as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, Ida had intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and swept ashore with top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported. As Ida pushed inland past to New Orleans over the next 10 hours, its maximum sustained winds diminished to 105 mph, ranking it as a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, according to the NHC. Palm trees trembled as rain blasted in sideways through New Orleans on Sunday, where retiree Robert Ruffin, 68, had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel. ""I thought it was safer,"" he said. ""It's double-trouble this time because of COVID."" Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet (1.8 m) along parts of the coast. Videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of Highway 90 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast into a choppy river. The NHC also warned of potentially catastrophic wind damage and up to 2 feet (61 cm) of rainfall in some areas. ""We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees,"" said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish, and one of the most vulnerable areas along Gulf Coast. The parish later issued an alert on Facebook urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee. Offshore energy operations in the region were at a virtual standstill. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said nearly 300 offshore oil and gas platforms were evacuated, cutting Gulf-based petroleum and natural gas production by 96% and 94%, respectively. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"A weary Australia plans reopening as COVID-19 death toll hits 1,000",4409,"SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - As Australia's COVID-19 deaths exceed 1,000, a grim toll but modest by global standards, a country that has used relentless lockdowns now faces perhaps its biggest health policy challenge of the pandemic - how to reopen. The highly infectious Delta variant has breached the country's fortress-style controls and entrenched itself deep enough in Sydney, Australia's biggest city, and with a foothold in Melbourne, that authorities have dispensed with plans to eliminate it. Instead, they plan to ramp up Australia's lagging vaccination effort and live with COVID-19, an approach that would help struggling businesses but which is opposed by states determined to crush the disease. Australia reported four fatalities on Monday, taking the total death toll from COVID-19 to 1,003, according to government data. It has logged an average of two to three deaths a day recently, the data shows. But while deaths are creeping higher, infections are surging to successive record highs above 1,200 a day. With more than half the population in lockdown, even those areas with little or no infections are affected. The exuberance that accompanied Australia's early suppression success has since been replaced with community frustration at a delayed vaccine programme that has only recently picked up pace. Just over 33% of those aged 16 and older have received two vaccine doses, well below most comparable nations, according to a Reuters tracker. As the weary nation reopens, authorities hope to avoid the soaring infections and rising death experienced in countries such as Britain and the United States - which recently posted more than 1,000 deaths in a single day. The lesson for Australia is that mask-wearing should not be discarded as restrictions ease and that classrooms should be better ventilated to protect students from the airborne virus, said epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre. ""Wearing a mask is a small price to pay to get that additional layer of control,"" said MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute, UNSW Medicine. ""We'll need a vaccines-plus strategy as well as ventilation."" PUSHBACK AGAINST LIVE-WITH-IT PLAN Australia plans to start easing restrictions once 70% of those aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated, expected late in the year. After 80% comes a gradual reopening of international travel, according to the government-backed plan modelled by the Melbourne-based Doherty Institute. Prime Minister Scott Morrison wants Australia to treat COVID-19 like the flu as vaccination rates rise. ""That is our goal, to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it,"" he said last week. But some largely infection-free states, including Queensland and Western Australia, are pushing back as they watch health services at the centre of the Delta outbreak in the Sydney area come under stress. There are 840 people in hospital being treated for COVID-19 in the epicentre, with 137 in intensive care and48 requiring ventilation. Mark McGowan, premier of Western Australia, said his iron ore-exporting state wanted to continue to ""crush and kill"" the virus, with lockdowns when necessary. The outbreaks and lockdowns are devastating tourism operators, said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. ""We are not in lockdown and that's great, but tourism is like a pipeline,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter where that pipeline is broken. If you sit at the end of the pipeline nothing is coming through."" The Australian economy, which rebounded swiftly in the pandemic's early stages, is set to contract sharply this quarter, threatening to push the country back into recession if the decline persists for the rest of the year. In the Group of 20 big economies, Australia is the last to mark 1,000 COVID-19 deaths. Among major Asia-Pacific economies, four – New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore – have well below 1,000 fatalities, with New Zealand having the lowest at just 26. Australia's rising case count means it will try to reopen under a cloud of infections when, up until the Delta strain, it was largely virus-free. Delta's high infectiousness, short incubation, and asymptomatic spread, meant it spread quickly after being first detected in Sydney in June. Caseloads are higher for younger people, who have had limited or no access to vaccines. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Evergrande to speed up asset sales as hopes swirl about gov't lifeline,5745,"HONG KONG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Too big to fail or too tough to save? As China's debt-laden No. 2 property developer lurched from one crisis to another in recent months its creditors, investors, suppliers, and bankers agonised over its fate with little hope on the horizon. But industry watchers say clear signs are now emerging that authorities at various levels are stepping in to avoid a hard landing for China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), amid worries about the ""social impact"" of a possible collapse that could cascade through the country's financial system. ""Its huge balance sheet will have a real domino effect on China,"" said Nomura chief China economist Lu Ting. ""If financial institutions lose money, they'll tighten credit to other companies and sectors."" Evergrande, whose debt has swelled to 1.95 trillion yuan ($301 billion), more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of Finland, is also set to accelerate asset sales to raise cash, company sources and analysts said. Concerns intensified in June when the developer failed to pay some commercial paper on time. Since then, its stock price has nosedived, its bonds have been cut into ""junk"" territory, and a growing number of suppliers have filed lawsuits to recover overdue payments. After having refrained from showing signs of bailing out the embattled privately-owned developer, Chinese regulators summoned senior company executives last week and issued a rare warning that it needs to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability. It's becoming increasingly clear now, analysts said, that Beijing needs to safeguard suppliers and their employees, in addition to home buyers, to ensure social stability, and policymakers may prioritise them over creditors. Banks have been instructed to roll over Evergrande's maturing loans, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, and many news reports on its woes have been removed from the internet. Those moves, coupled with the decision that a single court in Guangdong province will centrally handle lawsuits against Evergrande across the country, are the clearest signs yet that authorities are co-ordinating efforts, analysts said. Guangdong is the company's home base and the firm has been reported at various times to be in stake sale talks with various local government arms and companies there. Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment. According to financial news and data provider REDD, the government of Guangdong province is seeking feedback from Evergrande Group's major banks about forming a creditor committee for the developer, two sources briefed by bankers said. The government initiated the discussions with the banks last week and has yet to make a decision on such a move, which could pave the wave for a restructuring. Evergrande has 200,000 of its own staff, but it provides employment to 3.8 million people in the country, including construction workers, according to its website. ""Banks and trusts are relatively safe because they have collateral,"" said Oscar Choi, founder and chief investment officer of Oscar and Partners Capital. ""Construction workers are not wealthy people and need money to get food, without money they will stop working...if Evergrande has nothing to sell that will worsen its debt problem,"" Choi said Property sales, which Evergrande targets to raise 750 billion yuan this year, are its main source of cashflow, Choi noted. On Wednesday Evergrande warned interim net profit would slump as much as 39% from a year ago, as it cut the sales prices of its homes to boost revenue and on higher expenses. It is due to post the full report on Aug. 31. BARGAINING POWER If not swiftly defused, Evergrande's liabilities, which account for 2% of China's GDP, may trigger systemic risks, analysts and economists have warned. Standing at around one trillion yuan, the money owed to Evergrande's suppliers had not been widely discussed until recently when many threatened or launched legal action. read more Bondholders, on the other hand, said they are prepared for losses as Evergrande's restructuring is believed to be imminent. They also questioned how much of Evergrande's 2.3 trillion yuan of assets could be liquidated quickly, as potential buyers were expected to take advantage of its problems and seek distressed prices. Evergrande, whose other business interests include a bottling water company and an electric vehicle maker, also has been scrambling to raise funds by offloading property and land holdings in both mainland China and Hong Kong. After the regulatory rebuke last week, however, three insiders said the developer had even less bargaining power. ""Chairman Hui (Ka Yan) didn't want to sell at a cheap prices because he thought he's not desperate, but now he has probably changed his mind,"" said one person with knowledge of the sale processes, declining to be named because the talks are private. Hui did not respond to a request made via the company for comment. DOMINO EFFECT Beijing's decision to publicly step in to push for a debt resolution at Evergrande comes amid concerns about the collateral damage from its failing financial health. Construction firm Jiangsu Nantong Sanjian saw its credit ratings and outlook cut in June by two Chinese rating agencies which cited large amounts Evergrande owed the firm. State media reported earlier this month that construction work was halted on two Evergrande projects in the southwestern city of Kunming - one due to late payments. Policymakers also are concerned about the impact on home buyers who may have already put money down on apartments or arranged mortgages. The firm has hundreds of thousands of residential units yet to be delivered across China. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Osaka vows to celebrate her own accomplishments ahead of US Open title defence,1624,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka said she intends to celebrate her own achievements more and will not worry about the expectations others place on her as she prepares to begin her U.S. Open title defence. Osaka's match against Marie Bouzkova will mark the 23-year-old's first appearance at a Grand Slam since dropping out of French Open in June and skipping Wimbledon to protect her mental health. ""Recently I've been asking myself why do I feel the way I do and I realize one of the reasons is because internally, I think I'm never good enough,"" the Japanese player said in a social media post on Sunday. ""I'm gonna try to celebrate myself and my accomplishments more, I think we all should."" Osaka has emerged as the global face for the sport on the back of her four Grand Slam triumphs and outspoken views on racial injustice and police violence. She defeated Victoria Azarenka in three sets in last year's U.S. Open final before going on to win the Australian Open in February. ""Your life is your own and you shouldn't value yourself on other people's standards,"" said Osaka, who is seeded third at Flushing Meadows this year. ""I know I give my heart to everything I can and if that's not good enough for some, then my apologies, but I can't burden myself with those expectations anymore."" Osaka failed to advance past the third round of her last two tournaments but can look forward to the support of tennis-starved New York fans at Flushing Meadows, where no spectators were allowed last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Osaka and fans back for first day of U.S. Open,2400,"NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka returns to the Grand Slam stage at the U.S. Open on Monday and the buzz will also be back with fans bringing the celebrated New York energy to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for what could be an exciting fortnight. While the year's final Grand Slam has been stripped of some of the marquee names, with Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams injured, it is still shaping up as an absorbing event in Flushing Meadows as Novak Djokovic bids to complete the calendar-year slam. Already the winner of the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon, the Serb needs a New York triumph to become the third man, and first since Rod Laver in 1969, to accomplish the feat. The history hunting Djokovic opens his account on Tuesday with a first round match against Danish qualifier Holger Rune. Third seed Osaka will be the headliner on Day One when she launches the defence of her U.S. Open crown against the Czech Republic's Marie Bouzkova. It will mark the 23-year-old's first appearance in a Grand Slam since dropping out of French Open in June and skipping Wimbledon to deal with mental health issues. The contest is sure to pull in a crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium with fans, who must show proof of vaccination to enter the grounds, filling seats in the massive venue after a COVID-19 pandemic forced last year's event to unfold in eerie emptiness. ""It's certainly nice to be back here now,"" said Australia's women's top seed Ash Barty. ""This week is going to be exciting. It's got fans. That's going to bring a lot of energy to this tournament. ""This is a tournament that thrives with the energy."" Opening day will see two of the big threats to Djokovic's shot at history, with second-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev and Greek third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas both in action. Medvedev, finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2019, takes on Frenchman Richard Gasquet, while French Open finalist Tsitsipas faces 2012 U.S. Open champion Briton Andy Murray. Centre court action kicks off with an all-American rematch of the 2017 women's final featuring Madison Keys and winner Sloane Stephens. A long day's play will end with the possibility of some late-night fireworks with unpredictable Australian Nick Kyrgios taking on Spain's 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the last match at Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Israel offers COVID-19 booster to all vaccinated people,2292,"JERUSALEM, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Israel on Sunday began offering a COVID-19 booster to children as young as 12, and its prime minister said a campaign that began a month ago among seniors has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant. Announcing the decision, top Israeli health officials said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine waned six months after administration, making a booster necessary. ""The third dose brings us to the level of protection achieved by the second dose, when it was fresh,"" said Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry. ""That means, people are 10 times more protected after the third vaccine dose,"" she told a news conference, where the expanded booster drive was announced. Those eligible for the third shot can receive it provided at least five months have passed since their second jab - a timeframe shorter than an eight-month interval in effect in the United States, which is considering cutting the waiting time.

REUTERS/ Nir Elias Hoping to curb the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, Israel began administering the booster to its older population a month ago and has been gradually lowering the age of eligibility. It stood at 30 before Sunday's announcement. So far 2 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses. ""There are already results: the increase in severe morbidity has begun to slow,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement. ""But we have to complete third doses for all of our citizens. I call on those aged 12 and up to go out and immediately take the third shot."" Israel and other countries have pressed ahead with booster plans despite opposition from the World Health Organization, which said more of the world should be vaccinated with a first dose before people receive a third. The United States has said it will offer booster doses to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have also planned booster campaigns.

Fauci backs COVID-19 vaccine mandate for U.S. school children,1979,"WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said on Sunday he supports COVID-19 vaccine mandates for children attending schools as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to fuel a surge in cases in the nation. ""I believe that mandating vaccines for children to appear in school is a good idea,"" Fauci told CNN’s ""State of the Union"" program. ""We've done this for decades and decades, requiring polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis"" vaccinations. Currently, children under 12 are not eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. But Fauci, in a separate interview on ABC's ""This Week"" program, said there should be enough data by early October for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to consider whether the shot is safe for children under that age. ""I think there's a reasonable chance"" that the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) or Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines could get FDA clearance for kids under 12 before the upcoming holiday season, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said last Tuesday. As schools re-open for the fall, the rise in coronavirus cases is already causing significant disruptions. Dozens of schools nationwide have had to delay the start of the school year or shut down since opening in August, according to data from tracking website Burbio. Its data shows the impact on schools so far has been heaviest in the South, the epicenter of the current surge in cases and where vaccination rates among those already eligible are generally the lowest in the country. The re-opening of schools is also contributing to a supply shortage of COVID-19 tests in the United States as schools revive surveillance programs that will require tens of millions of tests, according to industry executives and state health officials, Reuters reported last week.

Shouting ""Hands off our children"", the protesters waved signs decrying what they called ""vaccination apartheid"" as parts of Germany consider imposing tougher restrictions on people who are not vaccinated against coronavirus. Dozens of police dressed in riot gear sought to control the march through residential streets in eastern Berlin. Berlin police said on Twitter it had detained about 80 people at the demonstration, with a focus on violent people or those calling for violations of coronavirus regulations. On Saturday, police detained more than 100 people at a similar demonstration after the marchers tried to get through barricades to the government quarter in central Berlin. About 60% of the German population has now been fully vaccinated and about 65% have had at least one shot, but infections are rising rapidly again, prompting officials to consider ways to encourage more people to get protected. With a significant minority in Germany sceptical about vaccination, the government in the city of Berlin has come under fire for exhorting teenagers to get the shots, which are authorised for those over the age of 12. At least one region in Germany is planning to impose tougher restrictions on people who are not vaccinated, an official was quoted as saying on Sunday. The German government currently requires people to be vaccinated, test negative or have a recovery certificate to enter indoor restaurants, visit hospitals and nursing homes and attend events, parties or do sports indoors. The southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg's social ministry has proposed banning unvaccinated adults from restaurants and concerts altogether, and restricting their contacts. ""If it hits the intensive care units, we have to act,"" Thomas Strobl, Baden-Wuerttemberg's deputy leader, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""It would be wrong to hold everyone jointly liable, including the vaccinated. That's why there will be different rules for the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated."" The health minister in neighbouring Bavaria also supports the proposals, the paper said. The leading candidates vying to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel in a federal election on Sept. 26 have pledged there will be no return to the strict lockdowns of last year and earlier this year even as coronavirus infections jump again. The country reported 8,416 new cases on Sunday and 12 fatalities, bringing the total number of cases to more than 3.9 million and the death toll to 92,130. To nudge more people to get vaccinated, the government has said it will stop offering free coronavirus tests from Oct. 11, except for those for whom vaccination is not recommended, such as children and pregnant women.

U.S. Gulf Coast residents flee 'extremely dangerous' Hurricane Ida,4569,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida intensified over warm Gulf of Mexico waters on Saturday, prompting tens of thousands to flee coastal areas, while President Joe Biden pledged aid to help states quickly recover once the storm has passed. Forecasters said Ida could make a U.S. landfall on Sunday night as an ""extremely dangerous"" Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, generating winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph), heavy downpours and a tidal surge that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline under several feet of water. On Saturday evening Ida was about 200 miles (320 km) southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, packing top winds of 105 miles per hour (169 kph) and aiming for the Louisiana coast, the National Hurricane Center said. ""We're concerned about explosive development shortly before it makes landfall,"" said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, which provides weather advice to oil and transportation companies. Flooding from Ida's storm surge - high water driven by the hurricane's winds - could reach between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 4.5 meters) around the mouth of the Mississippi River, with lower levels extending east along the adjacent coastlines of Mississippi and Alabama, the NHC said. Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled the seashore. ""I left Fourchon last night at 8 o'clock and it's a ghost town,"" said Andre LeBlanc, a sportfishing captain speaking from his inland home in Lafayette, Louisiana. “We were some of the last to get out of there.” POWER OUTAGES EXPECTED Utilities were bringing in extra crews and equipment to deal with expected power losses. Hundreds of thousands of homes could fall dark as Ida's strong winds carry well into Louisiana and as far east at Mobile, Alabama, said DTN's Foerster. Biden on Saturday said 500 federal emergency response workers were in Texas and Louisiana to respond to the storm. Aid workers have ""closely coordinated with the electric utilities to restore power as soon as possible,"" Biden said at a briefing with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. read more Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state is already reeling from a public health crisis stemming from a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ida's winds will be fierce and spread across a 300-mile area.

REUTERS/Adrees Latif ""We have a very serious situation on our hands,"" Edwards said at a briefing. ""This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in the state of Louisiana since at least the 1850s."" The state is not planning to evacuate hospitals now strained by an influx of COVID-19 patients, he said. There were more than 3,400 new infections reported on Friday, and about 2,700 people are hospitalized with the virus. ""We have been talking to hospitals to make sure that their generators are working, that they have way more water on hand than normal, that they have PPE on hand,"" Edwards said. OIL, FUEL OUTPUT CUT U.S. energy companies reduced offshore oil production by 91% and gasoline refiners cut operations at Louisiana plants in the path of the storm. Regional fuel prices rose in anticipation of production losses. read more Phillips 66 (PSX.N) completed the shutdown of its Alliance refinery on Louisiana's coast, and PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N) reduced its Chalmette, Louisiana, processing, people familiar with the matter said.

Ida, the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, may well exceed the strength of Hurricane Laura, the last Category 4 storm to strike Louisiana, by the time it makes landfall, forecasters said. The region was devastated in August 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people. Scott Pierce, 32, evacuated to Florida to escape Ida. ""We're terrified,"" said Pierce, an engineer worried about his home on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, the site of some of the worst flooding in Hurricane Katrina.

"As recall looms, California governor aims to galvanize Democrats",6033,"SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug 29 (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom and his supporters are stepping up their fight against a Republican-backed recall with a barrage of door knocks, text messages and outreach to communities of color as opinion polls show the Democrat in danger of losing. The group Voto Latino exclusively told Reuters it plans to spend about $1 million ahead of the Sept. 14 recall vote to try to persuade 600,000 young Latinos to cast ballots for Newsom, highlighting his need to spur more enthusiasm among Black and Latino voters. Democrats outnumber Republicans in California more than two-to-one. President Joe Biden won the state by nearly 30 percentage points last year. Half of the state's registered voters and 91% of Democrats said in a July 27 poll by the University of California, Berkeley, Institute for Governmental Studies that they want to retain the first-term governor. But a perfect storm of issues energizing Republicans - and complacency among Democrats who think the governor has it in the bag - has the recall election looking much closer than expected. Like Democrats across the country, Newsom has taken heat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from opponents of public health shutdowns, mask mandates and school closures. He also is grappling with a rise in cases of homelessness and homicides, extreme drought and devastating wildfires. A successful recall would serve as a wake-up call for Democrats already facing the threat of losing their majorities in Congress in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, said Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio. Maviglio served as press secretary for Democrat Gray Davis, ousted as California's governor by Hollywood action star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the state's last recall in 2003. Maviglio said Democrats must take the election seriously to avoid the same fate for Newsom, a former lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco. ""Democrats need a slap in the face to get off the sofa and fill out that form,"" he said. TURNOUT KEY The Patriot Coalition, a group angered by Newsom's policies on immigration and crime, spearheaded the effort to remove him. Their campaign gained steam as frustration mounted over Newsom's pandemic policies and a judge granted them extra time to get enough signatures to put the recall on a ballot. Voters will be asked to make two separate decisions - whether Newsom should be removed, and who should replace him. If Newsom is recalled, he will almost certainly be succeeded by a Republican with comparatively little statewide support. The winner needs only a plurality of votes to become governor, and just one little-known Democrat is among the replacement choices. Conservative talk show host Larry Elder leads recent polls, followed by businessman John Cox and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. Newsom goes into the final weeks of the race with a war chest of more than $51 million, campaign finance records show, compared to about $6 million for those seeking to unseat him. Keenly aware that turnout could decide the special election, Newsom's team is rolling out new daily messages predicting dire consequences for Democratic priorities such as abortion rights, immigration and other issues if he is removed from office. A Friday rally with Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, was canceled after a deadly attack outside the Kabul airport killed dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. ""There are no swing voters in this election,"" said Newsom adviser Nathan Click. ""There's no one who's choosing between yes and no. The 'swing voters' are all Democrats who are choosing between voting and not voting."" Just 36% of registered voters told pollsters at the University of California, Berkeley, last month that they favored removing the governor, with 51% opposed. But when researchers dug deeper, they found that very few Democrats were planning to vote - making the race exceedingly close with 47% of the most likely voters favoring the recall and 50% opposed. ""What we found was an astounding gap between likely and registered voters,"" said Eric Schickler, co-director of the institute that conducted the poll. The state sent mail-in ballots to all Californians who are registered to vote. Data released last week showed Democrats had returned their ballots by a rate of two-to-one compared to Republicans, buoying Democrats' hopes that their voters were beginning to understand the stakes. But analyst Paul Mitchell, whose firm Political Data studied the returns, said the early results could reflect Republicans' skepticism of voting by mail rather than heightened Democratic interest in the recall. Former President Donald Trump's repeated false accusations that mail-in voting was rife with fraud caused a shift in voting tendencies among Republicans that others in his party are now trying to counter. Political strategist Matt Shupe, the Republican Party chairman for Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he sent 35,000 text messages last week to members urging them to return their ballots. ""They need to not be worried, and they need to go and mail in the ballots,"" he said. Most of the ballots cast so far came from white voters, Mitchell's analysis found. Newsom also needs to persuade voters in communities of color to turn out if he wants to keep his job. Groups including the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project; Black Women for Wellness; the Chinese Progressive Association Action Fund; and the immigrant rights group CHIRLA are planning get-out-the-vote activities such as canvassing and phone banks. Voto Latino, which targets voters ages 18 to 34, has sent out text messages and digital advertisements urging people to vote, said Ameer Patel, vice president of programs. In coming days, he said, the messages will take on a more urgent tone, warning that voting rights, immigration and climate could be impacted if Newsom is replaced by a Republican.

India's Bharat Biotech scouts international COVID-19 vaccine partners,1450,"NEW DELHI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech is seeking international manufacturing partners as it targets a billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine each year, the company said on Sunday. COVAXIN, the company's home-grown COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in India, is one of two shots driving the country's massive vaccination programme. But Bharat Biotech has struggled to boost output, missing supply commitments to the Indian government, which is also relying on a version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. On Sunday, the company rolled out the first batch of COVAXIN shots from a facility in Ankleshwar in western India that has the capacity to produce more than 10 million doses per month. Bharat Biotech said it was exploring opportunities with its international partners who have expertise in commercial-scale manufacturing of inactivated viral vaccines. ""We want to ensure that Bharat Biotech can ably meet the demand for COVAXIN such that individuals across the country, and the globe, have access to the vaccine,"" chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said in a statement. Last month, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya told parliament that Bharat Biotech would supply 25 million doses in July and 35 million in August, less than half what the government had initially expected.

Japan eyes mixed use of COVID-19 shots to speed vaccine rollout,1415,"TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Japan is looking into the possibility of mixing shots of AstraZeneca Plc's (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine with those developed by other drug makers in a bid to speed up its vaccine rollout, the minister in charge of vaccinations said on Sunday. Japan, which has previously relied on the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) vaccines, approved AstraZeneca's vaccine in July and has secured two million doses. ""I have asked the health ministry to come up with an opinion about the use of AstraZeneca vaccines for the first dose and Pfizer's with the second, or the AstraZeneca's as the first shot and Moderna as second,"" vaccine programme chief Taro Kono said on the Fuji Television network. This could speed up the vaccination rollout by shortening the intervals between the first and second shots when using the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said. AstraZeneca's two shots are administered with an interval of eight weeks, longer than for the other vaccines. Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time. The country's vaccination ratio has lagged other developed nations. Japan has inoculated 54% of its population with at least one dose and fully vaccinated 43%, according to a Reuters vaccine tracker. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Yemen gets first batch of J&J COVID-19 vaccines,1201,"ADEN, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Yemen received its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Sunday, roughly 151,000 doses, the health ministry said. The desperately poor country, where health infrastructure has been devastated by six years of war, received 360,000 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine in March through COVAX. This shipment is the first batch of a total of 504,000 doses it is set to receive from the United States. The single-dose vaccines arrived as the United Nations warned early this month that Yemen, where only roughly 1% of the population is vaccinated, faces a third wave of COVID-19. The disease has killed 1,450 people in areas controlled by the internationally-recognised government of Yemen based in Aden, out of a total 7,751 recorded infections. The Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which is at war with the Aden-based government and controls the capital Sanaa as well as major cities in the north and west, has only announced four infections in areas it controls and one death of a Somali immigrant in April 2020. Yemen is set to receive doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from COVAX next month. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Khudadadi and Rasouli had expressed a wish not to speak to media and this would be respected. ""This is about these athletes fulfilling their dream of being able to attend the Paralympic Games,"" Spence said. ""And because human life is the most important thing, and the well-being and mental health of the athletes is our top priority, the athletes will be doing no media during these Games."" Khudadadi, a Taekwondo athlete, and track athlete Rasouli were evacuated from the Afghan capital a week ago and landed in Tokyo on a flight from Paris. The pair had been due to arrive in Tokyo on Aug. 17, but were unable to leave Afghanistan after thousands of people rushed to Kabul's airport in a bid to flee the country. Paralympic officials had said initially the Afghan athletes would be unable to attend the Games, which started on Aug. 24, and promised to help them participate in the next Games in 2024 in Paris. Separately, the World Taekwondo association praised the efforts of the IPC and other parties involved to ensure the two athletes could take part in the Games.

Taliban prepare to form new cabinet as U.S. evacuation nears end,2537,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Saturday they were preparing a new cabinet as the U.S. evacuation nears its end and they expected that sharp currency falls and economic turmoil following their takeover of Kabul two weeks ago would subside. Zabihullah Mujahid, the movement's main spokesman, made the comments to Reuters as the U.S. military winds down its mission to evacuate U.S. citizens and vulnerable Afghans and withdraw troops from Kabul airport ahead of the Aug. 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden. Mujahid condemned an overnight U.S. drone strike against Islamic State militants following Thursday's suicide attack near the airport as a ""clear attack on Afghan territory"". But he appealed to the United States and other Western nations to maintain diplomatic relations after their withdrawal, which he expected would be completed ""very soon"". The exact timing of the formation of a new cabinet remained unclear. Reuters originally quoted Mujahid as saying the announcement would be made in the coming week, but in a voice message later he said the makeup of the new cabinet would be cleared ""in one or two weeks"". Responding to a question about whether any women would be included in the new cabinet, he said this would be a matter for the leadership to decide and he could not anticipate what their decision would be. There is mounting frustration in Kabul at the severe economic hardship caused by a plummeting currency and rising food prices, with banks still shuttered two weeks after the fall of the city to the Taliban. On Saturday, a statement from the Taliban said that banks were ordered to reopen with a weekly limit on withdrawals of $200 or 20,000 afghanis. Mujahid said officials had already been appointed to run key institutions including the ministries of public health and education and the central bank. United Nations officials have warned that Afghanistan faces a humanitarian catastrophe, with large parts of the country suffering from extreme drought conditions. The economy, shattered after four decades of war, also faces the loss of billions of dollars in foreign aid, following the withdrawal of Western embassies from the country. Mujahid said the economic problems being experienced would be eased once the new government was in place. ""The fall of Afghani against foreign currency is temporary and it is because of the situation that suddenly changed, it will come back to normal once the government system starts functioning,"" he said.

Cuba to deploy China's Sinopharm alongside homegrown vaccines,3388,"HAVANA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Cuba, which to date had deployed exclusively its homegrown COVID-19 vaccines, will start also using the Sinopharm vaccine of its Communist-run ally China in its bid to battle one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world. Health authorities will apply two doses of Sinopharm combined with a Cuban booster in the central province of Cienfuegos from Sunday, Vicente Verez, the head of the Cuban Finlay Vaccine Institute, was cited as saying by the provincial state-run outlet 5deSeptiembre. The efficacy of the vaccine combo is above 90%, according to the outlet, without detailing where the data came from or whether Cuba's drug regulator had authorized the use of the Chinese vaccine. The World Health Organization gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm shot in May. Authorities who had said earlier this month they would be able to produce enough vaccines for all of Cuba by September did not explain why they were choosing to deploy a foreign one now. ""It seems obvious the decision to apply Sinopharm in Cienfuegos is associated to the limited availability of Cuban vaccines and the urgency caused by the explosion of cases,"" said Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol. The health ministry had said in May the plan was to have vaccinated 70% of the population by August but had so far only reached around 30%, said Perez Riverol, who has become a guru on Cuban COVID-19 data analysis, on Facebook. Meanwhile, Cuba has one of the highest COVID-19 caseloads in the world which is overwhelming its vaunted healthcare system which is heavily focused on prevention and primary care. The outbreak comes amid a shortage of basic goods including medicine that has fueled anger at the government, leading to unprecedented nationwide protests last month. Cuban authorities, which blame the economic crisis largely on a tightening of U.S. sanctions, have hailed donations of medical gear and food since the protests from allies like China although it was unclear if the vaccines were donated or bought. TOO LATE? Government critics had long urged it to acquire foreign vaccines rather than simply relying on homegrown ones, accusing it of placing its desire for prestige and good publicity over health concerns. Authorities said they preferred to focus scant resources on vaccine development and production than imports. U.S. President Joe Biden said last month the United States was prepared to send vaccines to Cuba if it was assured an international organization would administer them. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel retorted that if the United States cared about the island's humanitarian situation, it would lift the U.S. sanctions they accuse amongst other things of slowing down production of its homegrown vaccines. The country has developed an unusually large biotech sector for a country its size, partly in a bid for sovereignty given the decades-old crippling U.S. trade embargo. It is the only Latin American country to have completed the development of two COVID-19 vaccines, Soberana 2 and Abdala, which have elicited interest from nations worldwide from Jamaica and Mexico to Vietnam and Argentina. It says the three shot vaccines both have efficacy of over 90% although the data has not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. It has authorized both for emergency use.

U.S. Open unfolds amid a new era for players' mental health,3074,"NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Players' mental health is in focus as the U.S. Open kicks off Monday, after four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka led the charge for her fellow athletes this year. The 23-year-old withdrew from the French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to attend media conferences, which she said had an adverse impact on her mental health, and disclosed she had suffered from depression for years. The incident led Roland-Garros organisers to concede that the sport's governing bodies needed to do better and the United States Tennis Association (USTA) this week announced a mental health initiative for players in partnership with the Mount Sinai Health System. read more ""Sports psychology has always been in the realm of, 'how do we optimize on the court?' but there's so many reasons for why athletes are impacted after competition,"" Shannon O’Neill, PhD, a psychologist at Mount Sinai West, told Reuters. ""Really promoting a well-rounded person who is multifaceted, not just an athlete... I think is really critical in the therapeutic process."" A broader conversation on mental health in sport has unfolded since Roland-Garros, with four-time Rio Olympic champion Simone Biles withdrawing from several gymnastics events at the Tokyo Games, citing the need to focus on her mental health and drawing worldwide support. At Flushing Meadows this week, world number two Aryna Sabalenka told reporters working with a psychologist had paid dividends on and off the court. She previously credited therapy with helping her handle the pressure of Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-final in the best major performance of her career. ""Knowing that I have someone who's going to help me whenever I need it... it's definitely help,"" she said. ""One time at night I couldn't sleep because I was overthinking about everything. I just call her and I spoke with her... After that I felt much better."" Moving swiftly to give athletes more support is imperative for sport's governing bodies, Bob Dorfman, the creative director at Baker Street Advertising, told Reuters, with the issue still top of mind. ""The mental health of athletes had never really been a major concern until Naomi Osaka bravely made it public, and Simone Biles courageously kept it front and center,"" he said. ""It’s admirable that the U.S. Open is putting forward initiatives in this regard, but it can’t be mere lip service or temporary. ""Action must be sincere, ongoing and well-funded. Anything less will ring phony."" The Women's Tennis Association (WTA), for its part, joined forces with seven-time Grand Slam winner Venus Williams, partnering with mental health services company BetterHelp for a $2 million ""free therapy giveaway."" ""We need to create an accepting and open environment to seek professional mental health therapy,"" said Williams.

Number of French COVID-19 intensive care patients drops,869,"PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The number of people in French hospital intensive care units due to COVID-19 dipped on Saturday for the first time in nine days, dropping by 11 to 2,259 in total. Since July 21, the number of patients in critical care had risen continuously, bar a small drop on Aug. 19. This period of rising ICU numbers coincided with a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections, according to the French government. Vaccinations have picked across France, where the government has also introduced a health pass or official documentation proving that a person has had the vaccine in order to enter restaurants, bars, museums and sports venues. Thousands of people demonstrated in France on Saturday against the health pass for the seventh weekend in a row, although a majority of French people are now vaccinated.

"Sudan receives over 200,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from France",1506,"KHARTOUM, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Sudan has received a shipment of 218,400 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a donation from France, the health ministry and UNICEF said. The vaccines were delivered with UNICEF's support through the COVAX facility, they said in separate statements on Friday. In March, Sudan received an initial 820,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine made by AstraZeneca in March through COVAX and UNICEF. It also received 606,700 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines as a donation from the United States earlier in August. China also had donated quantities of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine. More than 800,000 people in Sudan including health workers have been vaccinated since March 2021 with the first COVAX shipment and other donations, UNICEF said on Friday. Most have taken only one dose, and the new shipment will contribute to an increase in the number of people who are fully vaccinated, it added. ""The vaccinations come at a critical time as the infection numbers are climbing while the country is preparing to re-open schools after three years of numerous interruptions,"" the statement said. Sudan, with a population of 42 million, will start a second vaccination campaign in some states on Sunday after receiving new vaccines batches, the health ministry said.

Modi hails India's 10 mln COVID vaccine doses in a single day,2021,"NEW DELHI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - India administered more than 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses on Friday, a national record that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed as a ""momentous feat"" for the country ahead of fears of another surge in infections. India has now administered about 628 million vaccine doses in total, giving at least one dose to more than half of its 944 million adults and the required two doses to 15%. The government wants the entire adult population covered by December. ""Record vaccination numbers today!"" Modi said on Twitter. ""Crossing 1 crore (10 million) is a momentous feat."" The previous daily record was 9.2 million. India's vaccine production has jumped this month, thanks mainly to the Serum Institute of India that is now making about 150 million doses a month of its version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine. The sharp rise in vaccinations came as India reported more than 40,000 new infections for a second consecutive day on Friday. Cases had fallen to a five-month-low of 25,166 in the middle of the month but have risen sharply in the last three days, mainly in the southern state of Kerala which recently held a large festival during which families typically come together. India reported 44,658 new COVID-19 infections on Friday, taking the total to 32.6 million, the most in the world after the United States. The death toll rose by 496 to 436,861. Kerala has accounted for nearly 60% of the new coronavirus cases in the past week and more than half of the total active cases, followed by 16% in the western state of Maharashtra. ""Any laxity in ensuring a strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and ensuring COVID appropriate behaviour, may result in a further surge in COVID-19 transmission in Kerala and its neighbouring states,"" the health ministry told the Kerala state government in a letter shared with journalists. Kerala said it would impose a lockdown on Sundays until further orders. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Two die in Japan after shots from suspended Moderna vaccines - Japan govt,2368,"TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Two people died after receiving Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine shots that were among lots later suspended following the discovery of contaminants, Japan's health ministry said on Saturday. The men in their 30s died this month within days of receiving their second Moderna doses, the ministry said in a release. Each had a shot from one of three manufacturing lots suspended on Thursday. The causes of death are being investigated. Japan halted the use of 1.63 million Moderna doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide, more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T), received reports of contaminants in some vials. read more ""At this time, we do not have any evidence that these deaths are caused by the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,"" Moderna and Takeda said in a statement on Saturday. ""It is important to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether there is any connection."" The government has also said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and the suspension of the three Moderna batches was a precaution. Fumie Sakamoto, the infection control manager at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, cautioned against drawing a connection between the shots and the fatalities reported on Saturday. ""There may only be a temporal relationship between vaccination and death,"" Sakamoto told Reuters. ""There are so many things we still don't know to make any conclusions on these two cases."" The contaminants found in some vials in Japan are believed to be metallic particles, public broadcaster NHK reported, citing health ministry sources. Japan has administered more than 124 million COVID-19 vaccine shots, with about 44% of the population fully inoculated. As of Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving shots of Pfizer Inc's vaccine and 11 after receiving Moderna's, but no causality between the injections and the deaths has been established, according to the health ministry. Adverse reactions have been reported at a frequency of 0.01% for the Moderna shot. In the fatalities reported on Saturday, each man had a fever the day after his second dose and died two days after getting the fever. There has been no evidence that their shots contained contaminants, a health ministry official told reporters. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Australia logs record COVID-19 cases, driven by New South Wales",2407,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Australia reported a record 1,126 coronavirus infectious on Saturday, the vast majority in New South Wales, the epicentre of the Delta-fuelled outbreak. More than half of Australians have been in weeks-long lockdowns as officials in Sydney and Melbourne, the country's largest cities, and the capital Canberra struggle to quell the outbreak. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, reported 1,035 locally acquired COVID-19 infections, breaking Thursday's record of 1,029 as the outbreak that started in mid-June continues to grow. Victoria reported 64 cases, mostly in its capital Melbourne, and Australian Capital Territory that includes Canberra had 26 infections. Queensland had one, Australia's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told a briefing. Despite the record in New South Wales, the state's conservative Liberal Party government said it would ease some restrictions next week, allowing for five-guest weddings. The state's management of the outbreak - which has nearly 14,700 active cases - has been criticised by officials in neighbouring Victoria, who have imposed stricter restrictions, believing the outbreak there can be suppressed. ""I'm not sure 1,000 cases a day is a sign of hope,"" Victoria's Health Minister Martin Foley said of the New South Wales infections. ""I'm pretty sure that if you ask those intensive care nurses in Sydney hospitals at the moment how they saw the situation, it wouldn't be a hugely rosy picture."" After months of supply delays with the Pfizer shots and public unease about the AstraZeneca vaccine, Australia has been racing in recent weeks to inoculate its population. At current rates, 80% could be vaccinated by mid-November. The federal government announced a plan last month that envisaged lockdowns as a key to quelling outbreaks until 70% percent of the population gets vaccinated and a gradual re-opening of Australia's borders when the number reaches 80%. Just 33.7% of people above age 16 have been fully vaccinated, but with some 49,800 cases and 993 deaths, Australia has kept its COVID-19 numbers relatively low. Neighbouring New Zealand, which had been largely virus-free this year, is also fighting a Delta outbreak, reporting 82 new locally acquired cases on Saturday, all in the epicentre Auckland, as the nation remains under a strict lockdown.

Philippines' Duterte extends coronavirus curbs as cases hit new record high,2570,"MANILA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has lengthened coronavirus restrictions in the capital region and some provinces, his spokesperson said on Saturday, as the Southeast Asian nation logged a new record in daily COVID-19 infections. The Philippines, which has among the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia, is battling a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases driven by community transmission of the more infectious Delta variant. ""We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a public briefing. The health ministry recorded 19,441 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, notching a record-high for the third time in the past nine days. Total confirmed cases have risen to more than 1.93 million, while deaths have reached 33,008, after 167 more fatalities were recorded. Active cases, at 142,679, were at a four-month high, overwhelming hospitals and healthcare workers in coronavirus hotspots, health ministry data show. ""Improving vaccination coverage, shortening the duration of detection to isolation, and compliance of people to community healthcare standards would really help us stop the transmission in communities,"" Vergeire said. The government on Saturday extended the second-highest level of quarantine curbs in the capital region until Sept. 7. Although some businesses can operate at up to 50% on-site capacity, restaurant dine-in, personal care services and religious activities are still prohibited in the capital region, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement. The capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to more than 13 million people, is the country's coronavirus epicentre, accounting for a third of the 1.91 million confirmed infections and a quarter of the 32,841 total deaths. Nine provinces and six cities facing a surge in cases and high healthcare utilisation were also placed under the second-tightest coronavirus curbs. The government is pinning its hopes for an economic recovery on its inoculation programme, which started in March. The Philippines has so far secured a total of 194.89 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, enough to inoculate about 100.5 million Filipinos or more than 100% of the country's adult population, the finance ministry said. Nearly 49 million doses have been delivered, while another 42 million will arrive in a month, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, adding that the government could inoculate everyone by January.

U.S. Gulf Coast braces for Category 4 landfall of Hurricane Ida after Cuba takes hit,4563,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida battered Cuba with roof-ripping force on Friday as it churned toward a weekend U.S. landfall along the Louisiana coast, prompting evacuations of flood-prone New Orleans neighborhoods and oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. By late on Friday, Ida was packing sustained winds of up to 80 miles per hour (129 kph), according to the National Weather Service, which expected the storm to intensify significantly before coming ashore as a major hurricane in southeastern Louisiana on Sunday afternoon or evening. Forecasters said Ida would likely make U.S. landfall as a robust Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, generating steady winds nearing 140 mph, heavy downpours and a tidal surge expected to plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline under several feet of water. Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - will likely reach between 10 and 15 feet around the mouth of the Mississippi River, with lower levels extending east along the adjacent coastlines of Mississippi and Alabama, according to the National Hurricane Center. Scattered tornadoes, widespread power outages and inland flooding from torrential rain across the region were also expected. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, his state already reeling from a public health crisis stemming from a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, urged residents to ready themselves for the hurricane immediately. ""Now is the time to finish your preparations,"" he told a Friday afternoon news conference. ""By nightfall tomorrow night, you need to be where you intend to ride out the storm."" New Orleans officials ordered residents to evacuate communities outside the city's levee system, and posted voluntary evacuation notices for the rest of the parish. Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome signed an emergency disaster declaration and said the city had pre-positioned sand and sandbags at eight strategic locations as part of storm preparations. Lifelong Gulf resident Hailey DeLaune, 29, told Reuters she and her fiance spent Friday evening boarding up the windows of his house in Gulfport, Mississippi, and gathering provisions to ride out the storm.

NOAA/via REUTERS ""Hurricanes have always been part of my life,"" said the high school theology teacher, who was born during 1992's Category 5 Hurricane Andrew. ""You just run through your list and hope for the best."" Edwards declared a state of emergency on Thursday, and on Friday U.S. President Joe Biden issued a pre-landfall federal emergency declaration at Edwards' request. It authorized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state. Edwards also said he had authorized activation of all 5,000 troops in the Louisiana National Guard for emergency deployments as needed. U.S. energy companies racing to complete evacuations of offshore platforms in the Gulf ahead of the storm had reduced petroleum production by nearly 60% and gas output by almost half, federal regulators said. read more CARIBBEAN TAKES FIRST HIT Soon after being upgraded from tropical storm to hurricane status, Ida smashed into Cuba's small Isle of Youth, off the southwestern end of the Caribbean island nation, toppling trees and tearing roofs from dwellings. The streets of Havana, the capital, were empty as residents shuttered themselves at home ahead of Ida's arrival, which government forecasters warned could bring storm surges to Cuba's western coastline. Jamaica was flooded by heavy rains, and there were landslides after the passage of the storm. Many roads were impassable, forcing some residents to abandon their homes. Ida, the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, may well exceed the strength of Hurricane Laura, the last Category 4 storm to strike Louisiana, by the time it makes landfall, forecasters said. But it pales in comparison to Katrina, the monster Category 5 storm that devastated the region in August 2005, claiming more than 1,800 lives. Officials in U.S. coastal areas preparing for the storm urged residents to move boats out of harbors and encouraged early evacuations. Officials in Louisiana's Lafourche Parish said they would enact a voluntary evacuation, especially for people in low-lying areas, mobile homes and RVs.

U.S. intelligence community says cannot solve COVID mystery without China,5138,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. intelligence community does not believe it can resolve a debate over whether a Chinese laboratory incident was the source of COVID-19 without more information, U.S. officials said in a declassified summary on Friday. U.S. officials said only China can help solve questions about the true origins of the virus that has now killed 4.6 million people worldwide. ""China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19,"" they said. President Joe Biden, who received a classified report this week summarizing the investigation he ordered, said Washington and its allies will continue to press China for answers. ""Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People's Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it,"" Biden said in a statement after the summary was released. The summary, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is set to worsen discord between Beijing and Washington at a time when ties are at their lowest point in decades. In the United States, activists worried the investigation could also encourage violence against Asian Americans. China's embassy in Washington issued a statement saying the report ""wrongly"" claimed that China continued to hinder the investigation and added that ""a report fabricated by the U.S. intelligence community is not scientifically credible."" ""The origin-tracing is a matter of science; it should and can only be left to scientists, not intelligence experts,"" it said. The embassy charged that the report was aimed at ""scapegoating China,"" an approach that would ""disturb and sabotage international cooperation on origin-tracing and on fighting the pandemic."" The statement also charged that Washington ""has been shying away from tracing the origin in the United States and closing the door on any such possibility."" China has ridiculed a theory that coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where COVID-19 infections emerged in late 2019, setting off the pandemic, and has pushed fringe theories including that it slipped out of a lab at the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick base in Maryland in 2019. The embassy statement suggested the United States should invite World Health Organization experts to Fort Detrick to investigate. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said the report ""underscores the need for China to stop stonewalling international investigations into a global pandemic that has cost so many lives and livelihoods around the world."" He also urged Americans to denounce ""hateful rhetoric and discrimination"" against Asian Americans. The U.S. report revealed new details about the extent of the disagreement within the Biden administration over the lab-leak theory. Several organizations within the sprawling U.S. intelligence community thought the novel coronavirus emerged from ""natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus,"" according to the summary. But they had only ""low confidence"" in that conclusion, it said. Other groups were not able to come to any firm opinion at all on the origins. One intelligence community segment, however, developed ""moderate confidence"" the first human infection with COVID-19 was likely due to a ""laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" A WHO-led team that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February dismissed that theory. But their March report, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists, has been faulted for using insufficient evidence in doing so. read more The new U.S. report concluded that analysts would not be able to provide ""a more definitive explanation"" without new information from China, such as clinical samples and epidemiological data about the earliest cases. Initially, U.S. spy agencies strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But people familiar with intelligence reporting have said there has been little corroboration over recent months the virus had spread widely and naturally among wild animals. ""While this review has concluded, our efforts to understand the origins of this pandemic will not rest,"" Biden said. ""We will do everything we can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again."" The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new committee to develop next steps on studying the virus SARS-CoV-2. But epidemiological experts said the window was closing for any useful data to be collected, particularly from people infected by the disease in 2019, when the virus likely first emerged.

U.S. on alert for further Kabul attacks in race to complete evacuations,6627,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. forces helping evacuate Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule were on alert for more attacks on Friday after an Islamic State suicide bombing outside Kabul airport killed at least 92 people, including 13 U.S. service members. The White House said the next few days of an ongoing U.S. evacuation operation that the Pentagon said has taken about 111,000 people out of Afghanistan in the past two weeks are likely to be the most dangerous. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the United States believes there are still ""specific, credible"" threats against the airport after the bombing at one of its gates. ""We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts,"" Kirby told reporters in Washington. ""We're monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real time."" (Graphic: Where bombers struck the Kabul International airport) U.S. and allied forces are racing to complete evacuations of their citizens and vulnerable Afghans and to withdraw from Afghanistan by an Aug. 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden after two decades of American military presence there. About 4,200 people were evacuated from Kabul during a 12-hour period on Friday, the White House said. Earlier in the day U.S. officials said a total of approximately 5,100 Americans had been evacuated, with about 500 more waiting to leave. While thousands have been evacuated, they are far outnumbered by those who could not get out. Some U.S. media including the New York Times cited local health officials as saying up to 170 people, not including the U.S. troops, were killed in Thursday's attack. Throngs of people have gathered outside the airport to try to get onto evacuation flights since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on Aug. 15. The attack was the deadliest incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a decade. Taliban forces have taken up positions in Kabul airport and are ready to take full control as early as this weekend, as soon as U.S. forces leave, two senior Taliban figures said. One senior commander said Taliban forces had taken over most of the airport, ""just not a small part where the Americans still are"". ""As soon as the Americans leave, they just have to give us the signal and we will then take over,"" a second Taliban official said. Kirby disputed the Taliban account, telling reporters that the military section of the airport remains under U.S. control. ""They are not in charge of any of the gates. They are not in charge of any of the airport operations. That is still under U.S. military control,"" Kirby said. Early on Saturday in Kabul, the U.S. Embassy warned that Americans should avoid traveling to the airport because of security threats, and those at the Abbey, East, North or Ministry of Interior gates should leave immediately. The United States expects some ongoing engagement with the Taliban will be necessary after the withdrawal to facilitate further evacuations, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The reality is, the Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan, including the areas surrounding the perimeter of the airport,"" she told reporters. ""So by necessity, that is our option.""

Victor Mancilla/Handout via REUTERS. SINGLE SUICIDE BOMBER Islamic State (ISIS), an enemy of the Islamist Taliban as well as the West, has claimed responsibility for the attack, which the Pentagon said on Friday was carried out by one suicide bomber at an airport gate, not two as it earlier stated. The number of Afghans killed has risen to 79, a hospital official told Reuters on Friday, adding that more than 120 were wounded. A Taliban official said the dead included 28 Taliban members, although a spokesman later denied any such fighters had been killed. The attack underlined the realpolitik facing Western powers in Afghanistan: Engaging with Taliban forces who they have long fought may be their best chance to prevent the country becoming a breeding ground for Islamist militancy. The United Nations Security Council condemned the bombing as ""especially abhorrent"" for targeting civilians trying to flee the country. Biden said on Thursday he has ordered the Pentagon to plan how to strike ISIS-K, the Islamic State affiliate that claimed responsibility. Asked on Friday if Biden sought to capture and put on trial those responsible, Psaki said ""I think he made it clear yesterday that he does not want them to live on the earth anymore."" Biden was already facing strong criticism at home and abroad for the chaos surrounding the troop withdrawal and evacuations. As the Taliban rapidly advanced to Kabul amid the pullout, Afghanistan's Western-backed government and military collapsed. Biden has defended his decisions, saying the United States long ago achieved its rationale for invading the country in 2001. The U.S.-led invasion toppled the then-ruling Taliban, punishing them for harbouring al Qaeda militants who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States that year. Most of the more than 20 allied countries involved in airlifting Afghans and their own citizens out of Kabul said they had completed evacuations by Friday. The Taliban said that Afghans with valid documents would be able to travel freely in future at any time - comments aimed at calming fears that the movement planned harsh restrictions. Taliban guards blocked access to the airport on Friday, witnesses said. ""We had a flight but the situation is very tough and the roads are blocked,"" said one man on an approach road. Medical supplies will run out within days in Afghanistan, the World Health Organization said, adding that it hopes to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif with the help of Pakistan. Pakistani officials told Reuters that at the Torkham border crossing, Pakistani security forces had opened fire on a group of people trying to illegally enter Pakistan, adding that two Afghans were killed and two wounded. Up to half a million Afghans could flee their homeland by year-end, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said, appealing to all neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. There are also growing worries Afghans will face a humanitarian emergency with the coronavirus spreading and shortages of food and medical supplies looming. The Taliban have asked all women healthcare workers to return to work, a spokesman said, as trained and educated Afghans flee the country. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations hit eight-month high over 100,000",2905,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The number of coronavirus patients in U.S. hospitals has breached 100,000, the highest level in eight months, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, as a resurgence of COVID-19 spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant strains the nation's health care system. A total of 101,433 COVID patients were hospitalized, according to data published on Friday morning. U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations have more than doubled in the past month. Over the past week, more than 500 people with COVID were admitted to hospitals each hour on average, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The United States reached its all-time peak for hospitalizations on Jan. 14 when there were over 142,000 coronavirus-infected patients in hospital beds, according to HHS. As the vaccination campaign rapidly expanded in early 2021, hospitalizations fell and hit a 2021 low of 16,000 on in late June. However, COVID-19 admissions rose suddenly in July as the Delta variant became the dominant strain. The U.S. South is the epicenter of the latest outbreak but hospitalizations are rising nationwide. Patients are held in the hallway as St. Mary Medical Center resorts to using tents outside to handle the overflow at its 200 bed hospital during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Apple Valley, California, U.S., January 12, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Florida has the highest number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, followed by Texas and California, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. More than 95% of intensive care beds are currently occupied in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. The Delta variant, which is rapidly spreading among mostly the unvaccinated U.S. population, has also sent a record number of children to hospital. There are currently over 2,000 confirmed and suspected pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to HHS. Three states - California, Florida and Texas - amount to about 32% of the total confirmed and suspected pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States.

England gets ready for mass COVID inoculations for 12- to 15-year-olds,1965,"LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Britain's government said on Saturday it had told England's health service to get ready for a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged between 12 and 15 starting in September, if vaccination experts give the green light. A first vaccine dose has already been offered to all 16- and 17-year-olds in England as well as to 12- to 15-year-olds with specific underlying health conditions and those who live with someone who is immuno-suppressed. Britain has so far not followed the example of many other countries which have pressed ahead with widespread vaccinations for children younger than 16. On Friday, the White House said half of U.S. children aged 12 to 17 had received at least their first vaccination dose against COVID-19. Most children develop only mild or no symptoms from COVID-19, but they are able to spread the virus. Britain's health ministry said ""we need to be ready to hit the ground running and start those vaccinations as soon as possible"" if the government's vaccination advisers backed extending the programme to all 12- to 15-year-olds. The advisers are currently weighing up the possible harms and benefits of such an extension. However, British health regulators have already said that the Pfizer(PFE.N)/BioNTech(22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines are safe and effective for those aged between 12 and 17. England's health service will begin contracting providers to recruit and train staff to provide school-aged immunisations to ensure teams would be ready to start offering vaccinations in schools from early September, the health ministry said. Parental or carer consent would be sought before giving children vaccinations, it said. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over health policy. As in England, they are not currently offering COVID-19 vaccinations to all 12- to 15-year-olds. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Biden's Supreme Court losses prompt more 'shadow docket' scrutiny,3966,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration was dealt a double blow by the conservative-majority Supreme Court this week, raising new questions about how the justices handle cases brought via an emergency process known as the ""shadow docket."" The court in recent years has increasingly made substantive decisions on major issues via the shadow docket, deciding quickly and sometimes late at night in a process that critics from across the ideological spectrum say lacks transparency. The administration of Biden's Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, did very well with the process, winning a wide majority of the cases it brought via emergency applications. Some experts attributed that to a court that has traditionally been deferential to the White House. This week's decisions have raised questions as to whether a Democratic president receives the same friendly reception from a court with a 6-3 conservative majority. ""What we are seeing are the consequences of a deeply conservative court, with the added travesties of the shadow docket,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal nonprofit based in Washington. The court in a decision on Thursday night ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions imposed by Biden's administration. That came two days after a Tuesday evening decision denying Biden's bid to rescind an immigration policy implemented by Trump that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico awaiting U.S. hearings. That decision requires the government to revive Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. In both cases the three liberals on the court dissented. Trump won 28 of the 41 cases his administration brought via the shadow docket, which his administration turned to at a much higher rate than those of both Republican President George Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama. The ""remain in Mexico"" request was the first request made by Biden, who faces a court with which he is ideologically out of sync. BREYER RAISES QUESTIONS In the evictions case, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer referenced some of the shadow docket criticism in his dissenting opinion. ""These questions call for considered decision-making informed by full briefing and argument. Their answers impact the health of millions,"" he wrote. The majority appeared to respond to Breyer in the unsigned ruling, saying the case had been ""thoroughly briefed"" and that the court had undertaken a ""careful review"" of the relevant court papers. Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law who is a critic of how the court has handled shadow docket cases, noted that the court did explain its evictions decision in an eight-page opinion. By contrast, the immigration case was resolved in a two-paragraph order. The eviction decision ""responded to at least some of the concerns,"" Vladeck said. But, he added, ""I still think decisions with implications as wide-ranging as the eviction moratorium would benefit from plenary review,"" meaning that the court would hear oral arguments and have more time to consider the case. But Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Ohio, said he believed the court handled both cases appropriately based on court precedent. In the evictions case, he added, the administration knew the court would likely find the moratorium was unlawful based on the justices' June decision that grudgingly allowed a previous version to remain in place. ""The CDC was on notice that the court would be very skeptical of a renewed moratorium, and made little effort to insulate the new order,"" Adler said. Last month, a Reuters analysis of emergency applications over the previous 12 months showed how certain litigants - most notably the Trump administration and religious entities - fared better than others."
Court denies challenge to wood-fired residential heater test standards,3501,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday denied the challenge of an industry association representing manufacturers of wood-fired residential heaters to an Obama-era rule updating how the Environmental Protection Agency audits air-pollution tests for the widely used heaters. A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied a petition by the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association (HPBA) that claimed a 2015 rule allowing for initial and audit pollution tests to be conducted at different laboratories was arbitrary and capricious under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The plaintiffs claimed testing results can vary drastically when changing laboratories and that the EPA failed to adequately justify its approach, but the panel concluded that the agency had addressed the group's concerns. Jack Goldman, HPBA's chief executive, said in a statement: ""This ruling means that the small business(es) that make up this industry are threatened by an unfair standard and we are enormously disappointed."" The association is represented by lawyers at Crowell & Moring. An EPA spokesperson referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, whose spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment. The 2015 rule updates a 1988 one that requires manufacturers to test at EPA-approved, private laboratories a representative heater for compliance with a CAA-mandated particulate matter limit. If the heater is compliant, the manufacturer receives a certification authorizing its sale. The update says that the audit tests, which are conducted randomlyand whose failure can lead to the suspension of a certification, can now be conducted at any of the EPA-accredited laboratories the agency selects rather than only the certifying laboratory, as was previously the case. The 2015 rule was spurred by lawsuits by New York, other states and green groups claiming the EPA had failed its nondiscretionary duty to update the standards. Wood-burning heaters, like wood stoves, heat hundreds of thousands of U.S. homes in the 11 states including New York and Alaska that filed an amici brief, that filing says. The states supported the EPA. The heaters emit various air pollutants including particulate matter, whose health effects range from shortness of breath to heart problems, according to the ruling. HPBA in a filing said a study it commissioned suggested tests for wood stoves, when conducted at different laboratories, led to wild variations in results. The variability would make it ""almost impossible"" for manufacturers to build products that would not fail an audit test, the association said. In Friday's ruling, U.S. Circuit Judge Nina Pillard said that the EPA's 2015 update was anchored in an adequate explanation for rejecting that data. Pillard was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Robert Wilkins. The case is Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Assoc v. EPA, et al, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Florida judge says governor cannot ban school districts from requiring masks,2291,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - A state judge on Friday ruled that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' administration cannot ban public school districts from requiring face masks to curb the spread of COVID-19, saying it overstepped its authority. The decision by 2nd Circuit Judge John Cooper marked an important turning point in the political tug-of-war between the Republican governor, who has said parents should decide if their child wears a mask in school, and several Florida school districts that defied the governor's order by requiring that masks be worn as children return to the classroom. Appearing by video at a Zoom hearing, the judge said the governor's administration overstepped its authority by issuing and seeking to enforce an order that prevented districts from mandating masks. ""The defendants do not have authority ... to a blanket mandatory ban against a face mask policy that does not provide a parental opt out. They simply do not have that authority,"" Cooper said. Ten of Florida's 67 school districts have imposed mask mandates with only a medical opt-out, the Tampa Bay Times reported. DeSantis' administration has threatened to withhold funding from those districts for imposing mandates, but the judge's injunction bars it from doing that. ""We will continue to defend the law and parent's rights in Florida, and will immediately appeal the ruling to the First District Court of Appeals, where we are confident we will prevail on the merits of the case,"" DeSantis told local TV station WPBF. Florida is one of several states where Republican governors have sought to prevent local governments and school districts from mandating masks. These governors have said that such rules infringe on personal liberty. Proponents of mask mandates have said the rules are necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases rise particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates, driven by the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant. The public health crisis has been especially acute in Florida, where more than 16,000 people currently are hospitalized with COVID-19, according to a Reuters tally.

U.S. resumes supply of Lilly's COVID-19 antibody combo to some states,1692,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Friday decided to resume the supply of Eli Lilly's (LLY.N) COVID-19 antibody cocktail to states where variants resistant to it are low, saying the therapy could work against the fast-spreading Delta variant based on lab studies. The Department of Health and Human Services narrowed the scope of authorization for the dual-antibody therapy, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, to states including Colorado, Connecticut and Illinois, Indiana. With the Delta variant becoming the dominant strain, the prevalence of variants resistant to the therapy is steadily decreasing, the agency said. Based on lab tests, the drugs administered together are expected to retain activity against the Delta variant, but not against Delta plus and variants first identified in Brazil, South Africa and Colombia, it said. The department had in June paused its distribution after the therapy failed to show effectiveness against the coronavirus variants that were first identified in Brazil and South Africa. read more The supply of standalone etesevimab to be paired with existing supply of bamlanivimab is also being resumed to some states. Regeneron's (REGN.O) antibody therapy REGEN-COV, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) and partner Vir Biotechnology's (VIR.O) sotrovimab may be used in all states, territories, and U.S. jurisdictions as they are likely to be effective against most variants including Delta, the agency said. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab, REGEN-COV and sotrovimab are authorized for use in people 12 years and above with mild-to-moderate infection and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.

"Winning streak continues for college vax mandates, state COVID rules",3936,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Though the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday struck down the federal eviction moratorium imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, smaller-bore, state-level COVID mandates continued their winning streak in courts. Federal courts, in a pair of decisions this week, upheld the University of Massachusetts' requirement that students be vaccinated, and dismissed as moot a challenge to business closures ordered last year by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper in Boston on Friday dismissed a lawsuit filed by two UMass students. Both students had argued in a lawsuit last month that the mandate, which is subject to medical and religious exemptions, was arbitrary and unsupported by science. One of them, Cora Cluett, also argued that an administrator wrongly denied her an exemption after determining that her Roman Catholic faith did not support one. Casper said that the mandate was well supported, citing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. She also said that Cluett's challenge failed because she failed to allege that the religious exemption policy was applied in an unfair way. The students' lawyer, Ryan McLane of McLane & McLane, and a representative of the university did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Casper's decision came the day after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that a challenge by a Boston-area bar and videogame arcade to Baker's business closure rules last year was moot. Baker, like many other governors, ordered the closure of nonessential businesses pursuant to a state of emergency last year as COVID rapidly spread in the state. He subsequently issued an order with a phased reopening plan, in which different categories of businesses would be allowed to open at different times as the emergency eased. Bit Bar alleged in its lawsuit that the phased reopening plan was illegal because it placed arcades in a later reopening category than casinos. After the lawsuit was filed, the governor shifted arcades into the same reopening tier as casinos, and the state moved to dismiss as moot. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns agreed, and Bit Bar appealed. Baker has since ended the COVID state of emergency and lifted all restrictions, but the bar argued that the threat of future restrictions meant the case was not moot. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson disagreed, noting that the governor had said he was lifting the emergency largely because of widespread vaccination, not to avoid litigation. ""So as long as the executive issues an unconstitutional decree and then another decree revoking that decree, the First Circuit thinks that there should be no cost to that,"" Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group, a lawyer for Bit Bar, said in an email. ""The day that the executive does something that they don't like, they're going to be sorry that they gave such latitude to unilateral dictatorial powers to the government.""

Kraft Heinz to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for office employees,1086,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) said on Friday all U.S. employees will need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to offices in January, as the fast-spreading Delta variant batters the United States. The packaged-food maker's announcement comes days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) vaccine, a certification that public health officials hope will convince unvaccinated Americans that the shot is safe and effective.

"Cops, firefighters challenge Gainesville's 'odious' vaccine mandate",3881,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - More than 200 employees of Gainesville, Florida, have filed a lawsuit seeking to strike down the city's requirement that its workers receive COVID-19 vaccines or be fired, saying it violates their constitutional rights. The workers, represented by Seldon Childers of ChildersLaw, filed a complaint in state court on Thursday claiming that various less-intrusive alternatives to vaccinations exist, and that many city employees will simply quit or retire rather than be forced to get a vaccine. The Gainesville City Commission adopted the mandate on Aug. 5 requiring city employees and contractors to receive vaccines by Oct. 14 or face termination. But many of the plaintiffs have ""durable and robust natural immunities"" because they have already contracted COVID, according to the complaint, and masks and antibody treatments may be just as effective as vaccines at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. ""In its mad rush to solve an intractable problem not of the Plaintiffs’ making, the City has conceived an odious scheme to coerce the Plaintiffs into taking unwanted and unnecessary COVID vaccines by threatening their livelihoods, pensions and dreams,"" Childers wrote in the complaint. The plaintiffs say the mandate violates their constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and privacy and bodily integrity. Shelby Taylor, a spokeswoman for the city, said workers' health and safety was the city's top priority. ""The City has taken the steps necessary to achieve that priority and stand by that decision,"" Taylor said. Several U.S. cities and states have said they will require public workers to become vaccinated, including Chicago, San Diego, New York City and California, amid a surge in COVID cases and the recent approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But Thursday's lawsuit appears to be the first to challenge one of those mandates. The plaintiffs said requiring workers to get vaccines is unnecessary and not rationally related to the mandate's purpose of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Because the vaccines do not prevent transmission of the highly contagious Delta variant, vaccinating workers is not likely to reduce secondary infections, they said. And by mandating vaccines, the city is risking ""catastrophic collapse"" if a large number of employees quit or are fired, the plaintiffs said. The city agency that operates public utilities, for example, already had 10% fewer employees than needed as of late July, according to the complaint. And in a recent internal survey, nearly 60% of the agency's 150 employees said they would quit, retire, or accept termination if they were required to become vaccinated, the plaintiffs said. In addition to the constitutional claims, the plaintiffs said the mandate violates a Florida law barring government entities from requiring individuals to prove that they received COVID-19 vaccines ""to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the governmental entity’s operations in this state.""

NATO allies struggle to keep Kabul airport open for aid after withdrawal,3949,"GENEVA/ANKARA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - NATO allies are struggling to ensure that Afghanistan's main gateway, Kabul airport, remains open for urgently needed humanitarian aid flights next week when they end their evacuation airlifts and turn it over to the Taliban. The airport, a lifeline for tens of thousands of evacuees fleeing Taliban fighters in the past two weeks and for aid arriving to relieve the impact of drought and conflict, was hit by a deadly suicide bombing outside its gates on Thursday. Turkey said it was still talking to the Taliban about providing technical help to operate the airport after the Aug. 31 deadline for troops to leave Afghanistan but said the bombing underlined the need for a Turkish force to protect any experts deployed there. Turkey has not said whether the Taliban would accept such a condition, and President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday his country was ""not in a rush to start flights"" again to Kabul. But aid groups said there is an urgent need to maintain humanitarian deliveries to a country suffering its second drought in four years and where 18 million people, nearly half the population, depend on life-saving assistance. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Friday that U.S. and allied air traffic experts had assessed Kabul airport ""for capabilities that would support the resumption of commercial operations once we depart"" and that the United States was working with all parties ""to facilitate a smooth transfer."" However, he noted: ""With the U.S. military set to depart by Aug. 31, I think that it is probably unreasonable to expect that there will be normal airport operations on Sept. 1."" Price said the Taliban also wanted a functioning airport and stressed that the operation of the airport after Aug. 31 was ""not up to us"". The Pentagon said several nations are willing to work with the Taliban to keep the airport operating. U.N. AIR BRIDGE The World Food Programme, which runs the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, is planning to start flights over the weekend to create a humanitarian air bridge into Afghanistan, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. ""That will involve flights from Pakistan into various airports, outside of Kabul, into Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif,"" Dujarric said. ""WFP is appealing for about $18 million for the passenger service and $12 million for the cargo air bridge."" Dujarric said it is unclear what would happen at Kabul airport after Aug. 31. He described the airport as critical to the work of the United Nations, which has stressed that it plans to stay in Afghanistan to help those in need. ""It will be incumbent on ... the Taliban to ensure that there is a system in place, security in place, for Kabul to have a functioning airport,"" Dujarric said. The World Food Programme said this week that millions of people in Afghanistan were ""marching towards starvation"" as the COVID-19 pandemic and this month's upheaval, on top of the existing hardships, drive the country to catastrophe. The World Health Organization said on Friday that medical supplies in Afghanistan would run out in days, with little chance of re-stocking them. ""Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,"" WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said. As aid groups struggle to keep supply routes into the country open after the Aug. 31 departure of foreign troops, Afghans trying to leave the country are finding the few remaining exits slamming shut. Several European Union countries have said they have ended evacuation operations from Kabul, and the United States has said that by Monday it will prioritise the removal of its last troops and military equipment. Afghans with valid documents will be able to travel in the future at any time, a senior Taliban official said on Friday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Fed's Powell holds fast to 'this year' timeline for bond-buying taper,5843,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a speech that affirmed an ongoing U.S. economic recovery and explained why there is no rush to tighten monetary policy, gave a detailed account on Friday of why he regards a spike in inflation as temporary and offered no signal on when the central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year."" In remarks to the annual Jackson Hole economic conference, Powell indicated the Fed will remain cautious in any eventual decision to raise interest rates as it tries to nurse the economy to full employment, saying he wants to avoid chasing ""transitory"" inflation and potentially discouraging job growth in the process - a defense in effect of the new approach to Fed policy he introduced a year ago. On the separate and potentially imminent decision by the U.S. central bank to begin reducing its $120 billion in monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, Powell said he agreed with the majority of his colleagues that if job growth continues it ""could be approriate...this year."" The weeks since the Fed's policy meeting in July ""brought more progress"" towards repairing the jobs market, Powell said, with nearly a million positions added and continued progress expected. But it also coincided with ""the further spread of the Delta variant"" of the coronavirus, Powell noted, raising risks that would need to be evaluated as the debate over the bond-buying ""taper"" continues ahead of theFed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting. In the days before Powell's speech, several Fed regional bank presidents said they were eager to get a taper underway, and to reduce the asset purchases fast, with some arguing the shift was needed to prepare for interest rate increases that may be needed sooner than expected. Data released earlier on Friday showed inflation continuing to rise. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge watched by the Fed, was up 4.2% in the 12 months through July, the third straight month it has been at least double the central bank's 2% target. read more Powell, however, was non-committal, and gave no precise indication of when a reduction in bond purchases might start. ""We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks,"" he said, signaling that Fed discussions about exactly when to reduce the bond-buying program not only remain unresolved, but must be squared against the health and economic risks posed by the highly contagious Delta variant. Stocks were trading higher after Powell's speech, with the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) hitting a record high, as investors took the view that Powell was signaling no rush to tighten policy. Treasury bond yields edged lower and the dollar (.DXY) weakened against a basket of trading-partner currencies. ""Powell understands that tapering will happen, but it's not going to happen sooner than later,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. 'PREPARED TO ADJUST' Powell's remarks offered a broad road map of where the U.S. central bank stands as it moves away from policies rolled out to counteract the pandemic's economic shock, while also accounting for the fact that the health crisis has not passed, and that millions of Americans remain out of work as a result of it. The pivot away from asset purchases now appears just a matter of time, as long as robust U.S. job growth continues through August and into the fall. Fed officials have said they expect the resurgent health crisis will not throw the recovery off track, though concerns about COVID-19 risks did force the central bank itself to move its Jackson Hole symposium from a mountain resort in Wyoming to a virtual event for the second year in a row. Expectations for continued job growth are in part based on reopened schools, eased childcare constraints, and a steady return to consumer spending on close-contact activities - developments that may be influenced by the worsening outbreak. Fed officials ""expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant’s effects,"" Powell said in his speech. ""For now, I believe that policy is well positioned; as always, we are prepared to adjust."" The next major decision, of when to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate from the current near-zero level, will be subject to a ""substantially more stringent test,"" Powell said, that satisfies Fed officials that the economy has reached maximum employment and inflation is sustainably at the 2% target. Powell, who spearheaded the new policy framework put in place by the Fed last year, is being considered by President Joe Biden for a second term as head of the central bank. Powell's current term expires early next year. Much of Powell's speech on Friday was devoted to an exposition of why he feels current high inflation does not necessarily meet the test because it is likely to pass, with the reasons ranging from supply chain bottlenecks that are likely to ease to globalization acting as an anchor on prices. While the current fast pace of price increases is ""a cause for concern,"" Powell said it would also be damaging if the Fed jumped the gun with a premature decision to hike rates. ""We have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis,"" Powell said. ""If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary ... the ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired.

The world number three picked up the Australian Open title in February but after withdrawing from the French Open and skipping the grasscourt season to protect her mental health, she has struggled to regain her top form over the past month. Early defeats at both the Tokyo Olympics and in Cincinnati raised questions about the four-time Grand Slam champion's form. read more However, the 23-year-old Japanese power hitter said she was happy with her game. ""I feel pretty happy with how I'm playing. I thought I played two really tough matches in Cincinnati,"" Osaka told reporters at Flushing Meadows. ""Of course I'm not, like, declaring that I'll do amazing here. For me, I'm the one-match-at-a-time like person."" Osaka is a perennial threat on Arthur Ashe since hoisting her maiden major trophy at the hardcourt major three years ago, as world number one Ash Barty acknowledged. ""Naomi is a pure ball-striker. When she has time to set up particularly after her first serve, she's one of the best first-serve, first-strike players I've ever come up against,"" said Barty. ""On a hard court, there's not a lot of variation on the bounce. She can set up, trust the bounce, and really swing through the line. I think that's what makes her so damaging on these courts."" Her arrival in Flushing also comes amid new focus on athletes' mental health. Osaka withdrew from the French Open in June after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to attend media conferences, saying her mental health was adversely impacted by the press obligations. read more She disclosed that she had suffered from depression for years, drawing applause from her legions of fans for opening up a conversation on mental health. ""I feel like there's a lot of things that I did wrong in that moment, but I'm also the type of person that's very in the moment,"" said Osaka. ""There's a lot of things that I learned to do better. Of course, I don't feel the same situation will happen again."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Purdue Pharma judge urges opioid plan opponents to settle with Sacklers,1101,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy on Friday urged opponents of the OxyContin maker’s reorganization plan, which would resolve widespread opioid litigation, to settle quickly with the company’s Sackler family owners because it would save time and money on appeals later. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made his remark during a hearing on Friday morning, five days before he is set to rule on the plan. The deal, if approved, would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the Sackler family owners from future litigation. Opponents of the deal have said the releases are too broad. “I think, having heard the lawyers from both sides – they are very talented lawyers, they know the risks they face – I would hope their clients would also be realistic about those risks,” Drain said. Purdue has said the deal, which directs funding toward opioid abatement programs, is worth more than $10 billion. The Sacklers have agreed to contribute approximately $4.5 billion.

Biden administration urges localities to block evictions after court ruling,2948,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Biden administration has written to state and local officials urging that they block unnecessary residential evictions, after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ended a federal moratorium aimed at keeping people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters on Friday. ""Our bottom line is this: No one should be evicted before they have the chance to apply for rental assistance, and no eviction should move forward until that application has been processed,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge and Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote to state governors, mayors and others. On Thursday, the nation's top court granted a request by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was to have run until Oct. 3, saying it was up to Congress to act. After the court order, over 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives pushed for congressional leaders to take action, writing a letter urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to revive the national eviction moratorium for the rest of the pandemic. ""We implore you to act with the highest levels of urgency to advance a permanent legislative solution in a must-pass legislative vehicle in order to extend the life-saving federal eviction moratorium for the duration of the deadly global health crisis,"" the lawmakers' letter to Pelosi and Schumer said. Signatories included Representative Cori Bush, who slept on the Capitol steps earlier this summer to protest a previous lapse in the federal pandemic eviction moratorium and the failure of a Democratic-majority Congress to do anything about it. Lawmakers so far have not passed any bills directly addressing evictions, but Pelosi on Friday said her chamber ""is assessing possible legislative remedies."" Congress approved $46 billion in rental assistance earlier in the pandemic, but the money has been slow to get to those who need it, with just $3 billion issued through June for rent, utilities and related expenses, according to U.S. Treasury data. House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters is ""examining the most effective way to expedite the flow of funding of rental assistance by states and localities,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democratic House members on Friday. The Biden administration letter to state and local authorities suggested they enact their own eviction moratoriums, noting that six states and the District of Columbia have already done so. It said state and local courts should also require landlords to apply for rental assistance that was approved in COVID-19 legislation earlier this year before commencing eviction proceedings. The letter said the Treasury Department is working with state and local governments to get the aid ""out the door and into the hands of renters and landlords."""

Class lawyers in App Store deal will seek up to $30 mln in fees,3437,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The class action plaintiffs' lawyers who reached a $100 million settlement this week with Apple Inc to end certain restrictions on its App Store will ask a California federal judge to approve up to $30 million in attorneys' fees for their work, according to terms of the proposed deal. Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, interim lead class counsel for the small software developers who are the plaintiffs, said in a court filing on Thursday announcing the deal that a $30 million fee award squared with attorney compensation in other class action settlements. The firms Freed Kanner London & Millen; Saveri & Saveri; and Sperling & Slater are on the plaintiffs’ executive committee. Small app developers sued Apple in 2019 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging anticompetitive practices, including the 30% commission the Cupertino, California-based company takes on the sale of apps and restrictions on direct communication between developers and their customers. Under the deal, Apple will create a $100 million small developer fund from which class members can seek compensation. Any leftover funds will be a ""cy pres"" distribution to Girls Who Code, a nonprofit focused on promoting gender equality in computer science. It also agreed to extend for three years a 15% commission adopted last year for small developers who make $1 million a year or less. The company also said it would allow developers ""to communicate directly with their customers regarding alternative payment options."" Hagens Berman name partner Steve Berman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Friday. A lawyer for Apple, Mark Perry, a Washington, D.C.-based partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, also did not immediately return a message seeking comment. In a statement on Thursday, Apple said the proposed settlement emerged from a ""productive dialogue"" between the company and the plaintiffs' lawyers. The plaintiffs' lawyers said on Thursday that they had invested more than 20,500 hours in the litigation. More than 5 million documents have been produced, the attorneys said, and Apple senior managers were among more than 50 depositions. The class counsel pointed to a 2019 survey that showed plaintiffs' lawyers received 30% as a median fee in settlements between $100 million and $249 million in antitrust cases. A preliminary settlement hearing is scheduled for Oct. 12 before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The judge is weighing a separate, higher-profile antitrust case against Apple filed by Epic Games Inc, maker of the ""Fortnite"" game. Epic's lawsuit more broadly confronts the control Apple asserts over its App Store. The case is Cameron v. Apple, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 4:19-cv-03074-YGR.

"U.S. weighing shorter timeline for COVID booster shots, says Biden",2220,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal health authorities are discussing shortening the timeline for COVID-19 booster shots to allow additional doses sooner than the eight-month window officials have been targeting, President Joe Biden said on Friday. For now, the planned timeline remains in place for adults to have another dose of the vaccine eight months after the original inoculation, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a news briefing later on Friday. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said U.S. regulators could approve a third COVID-19 shot of the two-dose Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Pfizer Inc-BioNTech AG (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) beginning at least six months after full vaccination. ""The question raised is: should it be shorter than eight months, should it be as little as five months? That's being discussed,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, adding that he had discussed the issue with his chief medical officer, Dr. Anthony Fauci, earlier on Friday. Biden said the U.S. booster program was ""promising"" and on track to start in mid-September, pending regulatory approval. Top U.S. health officials, in a separate briefing on Friday, said U.S. cases of the coronavirus continue to rise amid the fast-spreading Delta variant.

NIH starts study of COVID-19 booster shot in people with autoimmune diseases,1565,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is testing a booster shot of COVID-19 vaccines in people with autoimmune diseases who have not responded well to the primary vaccine course. The mid-stage study will be conducted among about 600 participants aged 18 and above who have been fully vaccinated with shots from either Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). https://bit.ly/3DpbYLl U.S. regulators earlier in the month authorized a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna for people with compromised immune systems, as concerns mounted about infections among such populations. ""Many people who have an autoimmune disease that requires immunosuppressive therapy have had a poor immune response to the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines, placing these individuals at high risk for the disease,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a statement. An estimated 8% of Americans have an autoimmune disease, which occurs when the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissues and organs. Participants in the NIH trial will receive an extra dose of the vaccine that was originally administered to them, and the study will record how many of them have a better antibody response four weeks after the booster shot. The trial will initially include people with one of five autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, with early results expected in November.

"Week Ahead in Insurance: Aug. 30, 2021",6709,"(Reuters) - Here are some events of interest to the Insurance Law community this week. All times are local unless otherwise noted. Monday, Aug. 30 10 a.m. – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear argument on whether military veterans whose mental-health issues preclude a felony conviction, and who are committed for mental-health treatment as a result, lose their eligibility for a “TDIU” rating – a finding that they are totally disabled because their service-connected impairments render them unemployable. Veteran Gary Philbrook applied for a TDIU evaluation while he was in custody at the Oregon State Hospital after stipulating to a judgment of “guilty (of attempted murder) except for insanity” under Oregon law in 2011. The Veterans Administration approved his application only after his release from custody in 2018. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims last year affirmed that Philbrook was not eligible before his release because the Veterans Benefits law bars TDIU ratings for “any period during which the veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility for conviction of a felony.” Philbrook argues that the Veterans Claims court erred in finding the statute unambiguous and clearly applicable to his situation. The case is Philbrook v. McDonough, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit No. 20-2233. For Philbrook: Kenneth Carpenter, Esq. For McDonough: Ashley Akers, U.S. Justice Department. Wednesday, Sept. 1 9 a.m. – The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear Texas-based roofing manufacturer Siplast Inc’s appeal from a ruling that its liability insurer, Employers Mutual Casualty Company (EMCC), had no duty to defend or indemnify it against a lawsuit by the Archdiocese of New York, which alleged that a school’s five-year-old roof was leaking and that Siplast had refused to honor its 20-year replacement guarantee. EMCC said there was no potential for coverage because breach of contract is not an accidental occurrence, and because the policy excluded damage to the insured’s own “work” (that is, the roof). A federal judge in Dallas ruled for EMCC last year based solely on the exclusion, saying the Archdiocese was seeking only the $5 million roof-replacement cost. Siplast says the Archdiocese also alleged water damage to the school’s ceilings and interiors, and had specifically demanded monetary damages “in excess of” the $5 million replacement estimate. The case is Siplast Inc. v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co., 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 20-11076. For Siplast: Christopher Thompson of Jackson Walker. For EMCC: Kevin Cain of Martin, Disiere, Jefferson & Wisdom. 2 p.m. – In a case on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will reconsider its previous ruling that North Dakota’s regulation of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) is federally preempted as a regulation of health plans governed by ERISA. The Supreme Court in February remanded the case for further consideration in light of its December decision in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), which revived an Arkansas law regulating PBM reimbursement rates. The justices said the Arkansas law “did not require ERISA plans to provide any particular benefit to any particular beneficiary in any particular way."" The PCMA argues that North Dakota’s law is still preempted because it is much broader than the Arkansas’ law. PCMA has drawn amicus support from the U.S. Chamber, America’s Health Insurance Plans, and the Association of Federal Health Organizations. Thirty state attorneys general and several pharmacy organizations have filed a brief in support of North Dakota. The case is Pharmaceutical Care Management Association v. Nizar Wehbi, et al., 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 18-2926. For PCMA: Michael Kimberly of McDermott Will & Emery. For Wehbi: Robert Smith of Katten Muchin Rosenman. Thursday, Sept. 2 10 a.m. – The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear its first COVID-19 business property insurance case, an appeal by the Guy Hepner art gallery in Manhattan from a ruling that its all-risk policy from The Hartford’s Sentinel Insurance Co. did not cover its losses from city and state shutdown orders because they did not qualify as “property damage.” The gallery argues that loss-of-use losses are covered under the policy’s business income interruption, extra expense, and civil authority provisions, and has asked the 2nd Circuit to certify the coverage question to the state’s highest court due to its “significant importance” to thousands of other New York businesses. The National Restaurant Association’s affiliated Restaurant Law Center, the New York State Restaurant Association, the New York City Hospitality Alliance and Mario Badescu Skin Care have filed amicus briefs supporting Guy Hepner. Sentinel has amicus support from American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. The case is 10012 Holdings Inc. DBA Guy Hepner v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. et al., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 21-80. For Guy Hepner: John Golaszewski of Casas Law Firm. For Sentinel: Jonathan Freiman. Friday, Sept. 3 2 p.m. – CVS Pharmacy’s opening brief on the merits is due at the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed in July to consider whether the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination provisions authorize private lawsuits over facially neutral practices that have a disparate impact on people with disabilities. CVS and CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, argues that the law allows private lawsuits only for intentional discrimination. The 9th Circuit rejected that argument last year, reviving a proposed class action by California HIV/AIDS patients who allege that Caremark discriminated against them by requiring ERISA-plan participants to use CVS or its mail-order pharmacy, as opposed to all other in-network pharmacies, to get the in-network price for the highest-cost tier of drugs. CVS argues that the 9th Circuit’s decision is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent interpreting Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that it deepens an existing circuit split between the 6th Circuit and the four other circuits which have considered the question. The case is CVS Pharmacy et al. v. John Doe et al., U.S. Supreme Court No. 20-1374. For CVS: Lisa Schiavo Blatt of Williams & Connolly. For Doe et al.: Gerald Sinclair Flanagan of Consumer Watchdog.

"U.S. COVID-19 tests again in short supply as infections soar, schools reopen",5214,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests increasingly in short supply as COVID-19 cases soar and schools and employers revive surveillance programs that will require tens of millions of tests, according to industry executives and state health officials. Test manufacturers including Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX.N), and Quidel Corp (QDEL.O) in recent months scaled back production of rapid COVID-19 tests, which can produce results on-site in minutes, as well as test kits that are sent to laboratories for analysis. The move followed a nearly 90% decline in testing and a similarly large drop in COVID-19 cases in the United States. Abbott in June shut down two production lines in Maine and closed a manufacturing plant in Illinois. Around the same time, Quidel shifted production away from COVID-19 tests. Becton Dickinson had also scaled back production in recent months. Now, with the Delta variant pushing U.S. COVID-19 cases well above 100,000 per day, test makers are working to quickly reverse course, industry executives and state officials told Reuters. ""We’re hiring people and turning on parts of our manufacturing network that were idled or slowed when guidance changed and demand plunged,"" Abbott said in a statement. However, testmakers including Abbott and Becton Dickinson cautioned that there may be supply constraints in the near term. “With the rise of cases from the Delta variant... there is currently some tightness in supply as manufacturers ramp back up,"" said Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesperson for Becton Dickinson, adding that the company expects inventory levels ""will normalize over the next couple of weeks."" Demand for COVID-19 tests has been largely driven by healthcare providers, employers and schools, he added. Supplies could tighten even further as more state governments and private employers demand staff either get vaccinated or agree to regular testing. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are among major employers requiring staff to be regularly tested. Testing in schools is a top priority for federal and state officials as a minority of the roughly 70 million school-age U.S. children have been vaccinated. Those under 12 are not yet eligible for the shots. Demand for diagnostic tests has surged nearly six-fold in the past two months, from around 250,000 per day in early July to nearly 1.5 million in mid-August, according to U.S. federal data. The data only tracks diagnostic tests that are run in laboratories. People wait in line for a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test at a back-to-school clinic in South Gate, Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 12, 2021. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo That demand is only expected to grow. More than half a dozen states, including California, Delaware, and South Carolina, have set up comprehensive surveillance testing programs for their public K-12 schools, while Pennsylvania and Arkansas are among at least a dozen other states developing similar plans. Even in states without such plans, many local school districts are rolling out surveillance programs. Ysleta Independent School District in El Paso, Texas, expects to need around 40,000 Abbott rapid tests per month to monitor students for COVID-19, said Lynly Leeper, the district’s chief financial and operational officer. Her school district had been planning to shut down its testing program until the Delta variant sent cases soaring in the state in recent weeks. SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNS Delaware, which was among the first to roll out a comprehensive surveillance testing program in July, has already begun to see some test shortages, said Dr. Rick Pescatore, an associate medical director in the state’s public health agency. The surge in test demand has sounded alarms among federal officials, who are “concerned that people are going to start shutting down our supply chain,” limiting the flexibility to respond to a spike in cases, said Quidel Chief Executive Douglas Bryant told Reuters. The recent increase in surveillance testing ""really stresses the supply chain,” said Dana Lerman, medical director at The COVID Consultants, a physicians group that provides COVID-19 testing and advisory services. Her organization has seen demand for rapid tests increase 200% since June. Even if testmakers are able to keep up with rising demand from U.S. schools, states will still face challenges covering the expense of widespread testing, which experts say will cost the average school district at least $1 million each year. Ysleta in El Paso said it expects it will cost around $3 million to safely test its students this school year, and is relying on Texas to provide it with funds. The Biden administration granted $10 billion to help states developing COVID-19 testing programs. Experts said the sum is far short of what states will need to cover testing for the full school year. “More federal funding will be necessary,"" said Dr. Antonia Sepulveda, president of the Association of Molecular Pathology that represents diagnostic testing laboratories, ""for institutions to continue comprehensive testing programs.""

U.S. regulators probe Peloton over treadmill injuries,2200,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) said on Friday U.S. regulators were investigating the company, adding to the exercise bike maker's woes as it deals with a backlash over reports of accidents involving its treadmills. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have subpoenaed the company for documents and information over injuries from its exercise machines, the company said in a filing with the U.S. securities regulator. Peloton recalled its Tread+ product in May, just weeks after saying there was ""no reason"" to stop using the exercise machine despite reports of the death of a child and multiple injuries. read more Its public disclosures related to the reports are also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Peloton said. ""Even with the treadmill 'fix' to prevent small children and pets from being injured, it is a high hurdle to get over when a child dies as a result of a product,"" said Walter Thompson, former president, American College of Sports Medicine.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which in April had warned about the dangers of the Tread+ treadmills, is already investigating the injuries. Peloton said late on Thursday its near-term profitability would be affected due to a decision to slash the price of its exercise bike and higher commodity and marketing costs. read more The company's shares were trading down 6.6% at $106.50 in afternoon trade.

Taliban say Afghans will be able to travel freely in future,1879,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Afghans with valid documents will be able to travel in the future at any time, a senior Taliban official said on Friday in a televised address aimed at calming fears the movement planned harsh restrictions on freedom. ""The Afghan borders will be open and people will be able to travel at any time into and out of Afghanistan,"" Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, deputy head of the movement's political commission said. The message came as thousands have struggled to get onto the last flights leaving Kabul airport before a deadline for the Western evacuation operation ends next week. Calling on Afghans to unite to rebuild their country, Stanikzai said that trained and educated people should come back to work. ""The ground is prepared for the doctors, engineers and teachers that Afghanistan needs and for people from every profession, whether civilian or military. All are invited to start their work,"" he said. Coming after a separate statement calling on female health staff to return to work, the message underlined efforts by the Taliban to reassure Afghans and the international community that they do not plan a return to their previous harsh rule. The desperate scenes outside Kabul airport, where a suicide bomber killed at least 92 people on Thursday, have provided a dramatic image of the fears that many well-educated Afghans feel at the prospect of life under Taliban rule. With the afghani currency falling sharply, many banks still shut and food prices rising quickly, daily life has become much more difficult for many Afghans since the dramatic collapse of the Western-backed government this month.

Moderna vaccine production continues in EU amid contamination probe,3612,"BRUSSELS/TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Production of Moderna (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccines at a plant in Spain can continue, the European Union drugs regulator said on Friday, while it carries out its investigation of a suspected metallic contamination incident. Japan on Thursday suspended the use of 1.63 million doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide, more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), received reports of contaminants in some vials. The contaminant found in a batch delivered to Japan is believed to be a metallic particle, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing health ministry sources. The European Union drugs regulator said it was investigating the incident at the Spanish plant run by Rovi (ROVI.MC), but did not find reasons to seek a temporary suspension of production after an initial assessment. ""COVID-19 vaccine production in Rovi is able to continue, following a preliminary risk assessment,"" the European Medicines Agency told Reuters in a statement. ""An investigation into the root cause is ongoing. EMA will be able to provide more information as the investigation progresses,"" it added. Moderna has so far delivered to the EU nearly 75 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, EU public data show. The company has two contracts with the 27-nation bloc for up to 460 million shots. Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets outside of the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue on a production line. A spokesperson said the company could not say anything more while it was investigating. Moderna put the lot in question and two adjacent ones on hold. JAPANESE INVESTIGATION NHK, in a report published late on Thursday, cited health ministry sources as saying the contaminant was believed to be a particle that reacted to magnets and was therefore suspected to be a metal. Moderna has described it as ""particulate matter"" that did not pose a safety or efficacy issue. A Japanese health ministry official said the composition of the contaminant has not been confirmed. In a statement, Takeda said it asked Moderna to investigate the issue and that it would work with the ministry to replace the affected supply. News of the contaminant could prove a fresh setback for Japan's inoculation drive as it struggles to persuade many - particularly young people - to get vaccinated. On Friday, eight more prefectures entered a state of emergency, meaning about 80% of Japan's population is under coronavirus restrictions. The government reported nearly 25,000 new infections and severe cases at a record 2,000 for Thursday. The ministry described the suspension of the Moderna batches as a precaution but it prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations and the European drugs regulator to launch an investigation. Airline ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) said it had secured more Moderna supplies and would resume inoculations on Saturday after a two-day suspension of the shots. Another health ministry official said it would take ""some time"" to tell how many shots from the contaminated batch had been administered in Japan. Kyodo News estimated at least 176,000 have been used based on municipalities' figures. About 54% of Japan's population has received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccination programme, said he did not expect the contamination issue to affect the government's goal of fully inoculating the adult population by November.

Canada approves Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents,1088,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Canada on Friday authorized the use of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents, with the country's health regulator calling it safe and effective for the 12 to 17 age-group. The vaccine was previously authorized for use by Health Canada in only adults over the age of 18. The two-shot vaccine is not yet authorized in the United States to treat children between 12 to 17, but was recommended for approval in Europe and has been cleared in the UK. read more While most children develop mild or no symptoms with COVID-19, they are still able to spread the virus and some remain at risk of becoming seriously ill. Canadian health authorities said they will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine and take action if any concerns are identified. The Washington Post had reported last week that U.S. health officials are reviewing Canadian data that suggests a higher risk of a rare heart condition in younger adults than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, citing people familiar with the review. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Clock ticking for Lebanese cancer patients as shortages bite,4569,"BEIRUT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Christine Tohme had already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer when Lebanon's financial system began to unravel in 2019. She never expected that two years later her country's economic meltdown would pose a direct threat to her life. The 50-year-old was later diagnosed with third stage colon cancer in February. Having undergone surgery earlier this year, she was then prescribed six sessions of chemotherapy. But with shortages of basic goods plaguing every aspect of Lebanese life, Tohme was told there was no guarantee she would complete her treatment as hospitals run out of vital drugs. So far she has only undergone three sessions. Her cancer has metastasized to her lymph nodes and she fears if she cannot complete her treatment she will only have months to live. Having knocked on every door to try to secure her medication at any cost, Tohme took to the streets on Thursday, despite her ailing health, to join a sit-in protest with other cancer patients, doctors and non-governmental organisations. ""I'm hoping that God gives me strength, as I don't have that much, to stand on my two feet and take part so that maybe people will see us and sympathise with us and send us treatment,"" Tohme told Reuters two days before the event. ""I have kids, I want to be happy with them and see them get married and become a grandmother."" Lebanese healthcare workers have warned for months of declining stocks of vital medical supplies. Many pharmacy shelves are empty as the country's foreign reserves are depleted on the back of a subsidy scheme used to finance fuel, wheat and medicine that cost the state around $6 billion a year. This month the central bank declared it could no longer finance fuel imports at subsidised exchange rates because its dollar reserves had been so badly depleted. CANCER HAS NO PATIENCE Tohme's case is not unique. Dr. Joseph Makdessi, who heads the haematology and oncology department at the Saint George Hospital University Medical Centre, estimates around 10% of cancer patients have been unable to source their treatment in the past couple of months. ""We need an immediate solution,"" Makdessi said. ""I can't tell my patients this is a crisis and ask them to wait till it eases because this disease has no patience."" Christine Tohme, a cancer patient, gestures as she talks during an interview with Reuters in the Jnah neighbourhood of Beirut, August 24, 2021. Picture taken August 24, 2021. REUTERS/Alaa Kanaan Lebanon's deeply indebted state is struggling to raise funds from abroad amidst political paralysis and has gradually eradicated many subsidies. But cancer medications are still subsidised, meaning in order for agents to import them they have to wait for financing from the central bank, which has all but run down its reserves. Yet Dr. Makdessi isn't optimistic that easing subsidies on cancer drugs will solve his patients' pressing problem. Some chemotherapy treatments, which can cost as much as $5,000 per session, are currently subsidized so the patient pays around $400, with the state bearing the rest of the cost. ""Even if you lift this subsidy to make the medication available, many patients won't be able to afford it,"" he said. The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan, who has been raiding depots storing large quantities of drugs and medical supplies, partly blamed the shortages on traders hoarding supplies. The Barbara Nassar Association for Cancer Patient Support, the Lebanese advocacy group that organised Thursday's sit-in, has provided medication worth more than $1.5 million in 2020 through in-kind donations from former patients. But now Hani Nassar, whose wife Barbara founded the organisation before passing away from the disease years ago, says the country's fractious politics is hampering efforts to alleviate the problem. ""The central bank wants to remove the subsidy and the health ministry doesn't and in the meantime the patient is sitting there without treatment,"" Nassar said. At Thursday's sit-in, patients said they were reaching out to whoever could help them get a second chance at life. ""After all I endured, I lost my nails and hair and my body changed, now I reached this point of not finding the treatment and this really set me back,"" engineer Bahaa Costantine said. ""I was a person who was full of energy and loves life, I don't want to be a bride for heaven, this is what I refuse. I hope my voice reaches someone who can help.""

WHO hopes for air bridge into northern Afghanistan in days,2812,"GENEVA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Medical supplies will run out within days in Afghanistan, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, announcing that it hopes to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by then with the help of Pakistani authorities. Trauma kits and emergency supplies for hospitals, as well as medicines for treating chronic malnutrition in children are among priority items for Afghanistan, where 18 million people depend on aid, the WHO's regional emergency director said. ""What remains certain is that humanitarian needs are enormous and growing,"" Rick Brennan told a U.N. briefing. An Islamic State attack killed 92 people, including 13 U.S. service members, outside the gates of Kabul airport on Thursday evening. L1N2PY01Q More than 200 people wounded in the bombings have been taken to hospitals in the Afghan capital, including a facility run by Italian NGO EMERGENCY whose trauma supplies are dwindling, said Brennan, speaking from Cairo. ""Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,"" he said. ""One of the problems we have in Afghanistan right now is there is no civil aviation authority functioning, but we are working with Pakistan particularly in the context of Mazar-i-Sharif airport. Because they can work with contacts on the ground so that all the necessary steps to land an aircraft, to land a cargo aircraft, can be put in place,"" Brennan said. Pakistan International Airlines will provide air transport for the operation, while WHO will arrange logistics on the ground, WHO spokesperson Inas Hamam said. Security arrangements were still being determined. U.S. military forces, who have guarded Kabul airport, are due to withdraw on Aug. 31, leaving a vacuum. Turkey has not made a final decision on a Taliban request for support to run the airport after foreign forces withdraw, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, adding talks were still underway. read more Insurance rates for flying into Afghanistan had ""skyrocketed at prices we have never seen before"" in the 12 hours since the blast, Brennan said. ""So we are trying to jump through that hoop at the moment and once we have addressed that we will hopefully be airborne in the next 48 to 72 hours."" Some 97% of the health facilities across Afghanistan monitored by WHO are functioning, he said. ""The more sobering news is these health facilities are rapidly running out of medical supplies and WHO is not currently able to meet these needs."" Some health care workers, some of them women trained in recent years as midwives, nurses and doctors, have fled, adding to the ""enormous brain drain"" from the country, Brennan added.

British music festivals ready to rock despite high COVID-19 cases,3144,"LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of revellers will descend on late summer music festivals across Britain this weekend, armed with a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination in an effort to curb rising infections. Reading and Leeds, twin events that are a rite of passage for post-exam teenagers, will be two of the biggest since the government removed restrictions in July following a rapid vaccine rollout. Reading had a capacity of 105,000 in 2019. With Monday a public holiday in England, other large gatherings are being staged across the country, including the 70,000-strong Creamfields event in northwest England. The traditional Notting Hill Carnival in London has however been cancelled again. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said this month that a successful hosting of the British Grand Prix and Wimbledon tennis tournament last month showed mass events could be held safely, but that caution was needed in crowded settings. However, many health experts remain concerned that people will lose their inhibitions in the excitement, causing a spike in cases. Soccer matches in the Euro 2020 tournament and a surfing festival in Cornwall have already led to significant outbreaks in one of the countries hardest hit by the virus. Cornwall Council has said 4,700 cases could be linked to the Boardmasters festival, which attracted about 50,000 people to the small seaside town of Newquay this month. Meradin Peachey, director of public health for the area that covers Reading to the west of London, said a spike was a concern given that older teenagers were offered vaccines only this month. ""Sixteen, seventeen year olds are the main groups that are going to be there and they're not covered yet,"" she told BBC News. ""We are trying to ask people to show proof of a lateral flow test before you even get anywhere near the gates."" British infections have started to rise again, with about 34,000 cases and around 100 deaths being reported per day in the last week. But admissions to hospital remain well below previous peaks of the pandemic. 'UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL' Scientists believe the trigger points for spreading the virus are public transport and shared cars to get to events as outdoor gatherings themselves, even with large numbers, can be relatively risk free. Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said mixing at festivals was a risk when the rate of infection was about 25 times higher than a year ago thanks to the Delta variant. ""I think there's a greater capacity for people to be more intimate with one another, up close and personal, than in regimented seating you'll see somewhere like the Grand Prix,"" he said, referring to the Formula One race. With the music industry desperate to start touring again, festival organisers say the need for a negative test or vaccine will prevent cases from surging. Pop-up vaccination clinics will be on site at the Reading and Leeds festivals headlined by UK rapper Stormzy, but no one under the influence of drink or drugs will be inoculated, health organisers said.

Taliban say Afghan women health service staff should go back to work,1172,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Taliban have asked all women healthcare workers to return to work, a spokesman said on Friday amid mounting pressure on public services that has risen as many trained and educated Afghans have fled the country. Women have been discouraged from going to work and even been turned away from their offices, prompting fears the movement will repeat the stance of their previous government before 2001 when women were not allowed to work. However, growing complaints that the fragile health system was short of staff appear to have prompted an about-face. ""The Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate advises all women employees in the centre and provinces that they should attend work regularly,"" a statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. ""They will face no impediment to performing their duties from the Islamic Emirate,"" he said. Since the Taliban swept into Kabul on Aug. 15, they have struggled to re-establish basic services, with many specialists associated with the Western-backed government joining an exodus out of the country or remaining at home out of fear of reprisal.

JHL Biotech founders convicted of conspiring to steal Genentech trade secrets,3239,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Racho Jordanov and Rose Lin, co-founders of Taiwanese biopharmaceutical company JHL Biotech, have been convicted in a San Francisco federal court of conspiring to steal trade secrets related to blockbuster drugs made by Roche's Genentech Inc, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. Jordanov, 73, and Lin, 72, admitted to hiring former Genentech employees and using their stolen information to copy its cancer and cystic-fibrosis drugs, as well as defrauding JHL's planned manufacturing partner, French drugmaker Sanofi, out of $101 million, DOJ said in a Thursday press release. Jordanov and Lin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit trade-secret theft and wire fraud on Tuesday under an agreement that dismisses other claims against them if they comply with its terms, the DOJ said. They had pleaded not guilty after being indicted in July. Text of the plea agreements wasn't immediately available. DOJ declined to comment. JHL, now known as Eden Biologics, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Jordanov's attorneys Edward Swanson and Britt Evangelist of Swanson & McNamara or Lin's attorneys Miles Ehrlich and Amy Craig of Ramsey & Ehrlich. Jordanov and Lin, who formerly worked at Genentech, schemed to steal San Francisco-based Genentech's trade secrets between 2011 and 2019, according to DOJ's announcement. They co-founded JHL in 2012 and allegedly used the secrets to speed the development of its biosimilars. JHL made biosimilars of Genentech's cystic fibrosis drug Pulmozyme and cancer drugs Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, according to the indictment. The cancer drugs are some of Roche's most commercially successful, each bringing in over $4 billion in sales last year. Jordanov and Lin also admitted to defrauding Sanofi into a strategic partnership by concealing that JHL's biosimilars were based on the stolen trade secrets. Xanthe Lam, a former principal scientist for Genentech who secretly worked for JHL, and her husband Allen Lam pleaded guilty in July to stealing trade secrets from the company and passing them to competitors including JHL. Genentech and JHL settled a related civil trade-secret case last year for an undisclosed amount of money and an agreement for JHL to stop using the offending technology. U.S. District Judge William Alsup will preside over Jordanov and Lin's sentencing on December 7. The case is United States v. Jordanov, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, 3:21-cr-0227.

Dozens of unaccompanied Afghan children evacuated to the United States,2664,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - About three dozen unaccompanied Afghan children have been placed in U.S. government custody after being evacuated from Afghanistan during the hurried U.S. withdrawal in recent weeks, U.S. officials told Reuters. The children arrived at the Kabul airport without a parent or legal guardian and were referred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) refugee office upon arriving in the United States, according to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal government operations. Of 34 Afghan children taken into U.S. government custody as of Thursday, 24 remain after some were quickly placed with close family members. The children in custody are housed in U.S.-government shelters experienced with caring for Afghan children, said the official, who would not disclose the location for safety reasons. The unaccompanied children are part of a growing number of refugees airlifted out Afghanistan in what President Joe Biden's administration says is one of the biggest airlifts in history. Since Aug. 14, the United States has airlifted about 105,000 people out of the country, a figure that includes U.S. citizens, Afghans and foreign nationals. The U.S. government has not said how many Afghans have arrived in the United States, but advocates say thousands have already entered the country. read more The unaccompanied children being placed in U.S. government custody do not have parents in the United States and, in some cases, the parents are deceased, the official said. ""If their parents aren't here now but will be, we need a place for them to go in the interim and then they will be united when their parents get here,"" the official said. The children make up a fraction of the nearly 15,000 unaccompanied children in the care of the HHS refugee office, most of whom come from Central America and arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border. An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that it was working to ensure the children would be ""placed with licensed care providers that are able to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services."" HHS is working to recruit more Afghan foster families to its network in the event some of the children cannot be placed with family members in the United States, the official said. Most of the unaccompanied Afghan children are older teens, the official said. Of the 10 children not currently in HHS custody, four were placed with close family members with whom they arrived, the person said. The other six were en route from the custody of U.S. border authorities to placements in an HHS-run shelter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge extends block on Texas governor's migrant transit ban,4075,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas has blocked enforcement of an executive order by the state's governor, Greg Abbott, aimed at restricting the transport of migrants through the state amid a surge in border crossings and the COVID-19 pandemic, pending the outcome of legal challenges by the Biden administration and advocacy groups. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso on Thursday said the July executive order interferes with the federal government's ability to make immigration determinations and to hire contractors to transport migrants between facilities. ""As with the other States and their governors, Texas and Governor Abbott have broad authority to prevent and limit the spread of the coronavirus ... but they have presented no evidence in this case that (the ban) will be effective to achieve this goal,"" Cardone wrote. Cardone on Aug. 3 had issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the ban. Thursday's order converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction, which will remain in place pending the outcome of the two consolidated lawsuits. Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did the U.S. Department of Justice. Abbott, a Republican, said in issuing the order that it was aimed at preventing migrants from potentially spreading COVID-19. The order permits only ""law enforcement officials"" to provide ground transport for migrants detained for illegally crossing the southern border. The order also gives state police the authority to stop any vehicle suspected of carrying migrants and send it back to its point of origin. The Biden administration in its lawsuit claims the order permits Texas state officials to make determinations based on immigration status in violation of federal law and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The order also would unlawfully permit Texas state troopers to interfere with the transport of migrants by private contractors that are routinely hired by the federal government, DOJ said. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a similar challenge to Abbott's order earlier this month on behalf of several nonprofits. The ACLU says Abbott's order bars anyone from transporting the very people whom the federal government has intentionally released pending immigration proceedings, such as asylum applicants. In opposing the bid for a preliminary injunction, Texas argued that the object of the order is public health, an area of traditional state authority, and not immigration. The state said that in June, federal authorities reported a 900% increase in the number of COVID-positive migrants detained at the border. But Cardone on Thursday said that regardless of the object of the order, it clearly would have the effect of disrupting federal enforcement of immigration laws. ""To consider only the regulation’s purpose ... would enable state legislatures to nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by identifying some other policy that may be furthered by the state law,"" she wrote. And Texas had not shown that the recent surge in COVID cases among migrants was any larger than rates among U.S. citizens, Cardone said. The case is USA v.

Qiagen shares hit 21-year high as COVID-19 test demand revives,2295,"FRANKFURT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - German genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE) is seeing demand for its COVID-19 tests firming up again, leading it to believe that sagging demand in July was temporary, Chief Financial Officer Roland Sackers said on Friday. The stock extended gains to hit a 21-year high after the comments, trading 2.6% higher at 47.51 euros by 1520 GMT versus a record 61.24 set in 2000. Qiagen, whose shareholders a year ago rebuffed a takeover bid by life science tools maker Thermo Fisher (TMO.N), had said in July that faster-than-expected uptake of vaccination campaigns weighed on demand for its diagnostics kits, prompting it to cut its full-year guidance. Sackers told Reuters that demand for tests had taken yet another turn as continued breakthrough infections from the Delta coronavirus variant in some vaccinated people was fuelling test kit demand. ""We are now at a turning point where we realise that a one-off boost is turning into normal business. COVID is becoming an infectious disease that stays with us. Therefore the tests will stay,"" he said. In July, Qiagen predicted currency-adjusted sales growth of at least 12% in 2021, down from a previous outlook of 18%-20% amid a dip in demand for COVID-19 tests, even though second-quarter non-COVID related business including latent tuberculosis tests surpassed expectations. ""A growing COVID business is an additional upside to our guidance and it looks like we can realise some of that upside,"" Sackers added, when asked about the revised outlook. ""I'm very confident that we'll have a good third quarter."" Industry executives and health officials have told Reuters that U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests as infection cases soar, and schools and employers revive surveillance programmes. read more A spokesperson for Qiagen, which also serves the U.S. market, said it had the capacity to meet growing demand there. Asked about the prospect of Qiagen becoming a takeover target again, Sackers said he had strong confidence in the group's growth potential but would not rule out any tie-up. Qiagen could purchase companies worth well over $1 billion but share buybacks were also an option to spend excess cash, he added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Zoning rules create affordability and economic benefits,8364,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 27, 2021 - Increasingly, municipalities across the United States seek to create affordable housing for their constituents. Some regulatory zoning schemes targeting affordability, like transferable density units and development credits, have been around for years, while others, like allowing more properties to be used for rental purposes, are relatively new (or at least new to some jurisdictions). Developers may leverage some such regulatory schemes into opportunities to offset hurdles like increased materials costs. However, developers and their counsel will need to review any new zoning regulatory schemes carefully as some rules that are nominally designed to address affordable housing and otherwise spur development may not do so in practice. At their core, many zoning regulations designed to make housing more affordable seek to increase the density of units within a jurisdiction. Putting more units in a smaller area of real property will theoretically make housing more accessible within that area, thereby reducing the prices of dwelling units in that area overall. Experts are mixed on the results of such approaches. Efficacy aside, one such tactic to promote affordability is to permit accessory dwelling units on otherwise single-family parcels of real property. While specific definitions vary, an accessory dwelling unit is generally an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit constructed on a parcel of real property that already contains a primary residence. Such an accessory dwelling unit should provide full living facilities (e.g., bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living area) to its occupants separate from those living facilities provided in the primary residence. Some jurisdictions have long implemented and expanded zoning regimes to encourage the use of accessory dwelling units. California, for example, first implemented statewide statutes related to accessory dwelling units decades ago. See e.g., Cal. Gov. Code § 65852 et seq. The state continues to promote the use of accessory dwelling units, at least for the time being, such as by offering state-level funding, See e.g., Cal. Health & Safety Code § 50515.03. The state also continues to update its accessory dwelling unit-statutory regime regularly, demonstrating that the policy remains top-of-mind for lawmakers. Other jurisdictions have only recently implemented zoning provisions permitting widespread use of accessory dwelling units and have not done so with the same level of detail as California. For example, the Metropolitan Council of Nashville, Tenn., recently approved a detached accessory dwelling unit overlay district to permit the construction of detached accessory dwelling units in certain single-family zoning districts. See Metropolitan Council Ordinance BL2021-620 (""Nashville DADU Ordinance""). One express goal of the Nashville DADU Ordinance is to address the ""relative lack of affordable housing in the center-city of Nashville."" Id. Likewise, the city of Gainesville, Fla., added accessory dwelling units as a permitted use within various zoning districts, including single-family zoning districts, just within the past few years. See City Commission Ordinance No. 190988 (""Gainesville ADU Ordinance""). Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville DADU Ordinance provides a prime example of the types of pitfalls that may face a business or individual who seeks to take advantage of new ""affordability"" regimes. For example, the Nashville DADU Ordinance requires that any new detached accessory dwelling units with the detached accessory dwelling unit overlay district must comply with such standards as those related to ""lot area, setbacks, bulk & massing, design, and access."" See Nashville DADU Ordinance. Suppose a particular parcel of property on which a detached accessory dwelling unit may be technically permitted is not large enough for a detached accessory dwelling unit to be installed on such parcel in compliance with applicable setback lines. In that case, the new regime will not practically benefit such parcel. In other words, the new regime will not increase affordability for a jurisdiction if the parcels to which the regime may nominally be applied cannot technically comply with the regime's requirements. Of course, such hurdles are not unique to Nashville. State of California. For comparison, the extensive California accessory dwelling unit-statutory regime includes at least certain language that appears to reduce obstacles using accessory dwelling unit regimes. Among other things, Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code provides that an application for an applicable accessory dwelling unit should be ""approved ministerially without discretionary review or a hearing."" Such language implies that a local government should not be permitted to bar the construction of an accessory dwelling unit based on immeasurable, discretionary factors. Of course, California (at the state level) still gives local governments the discretion to require accessory dwelling units to comply with setbacks and technical requirements. Gainesville, Florida. At the other end of the spectrum, the Gainesville ADU Ordinance imposes relatively few restrictions on accessory dwelling units. Instead, the ordinance broadly permits accessory dwelling units within residential zoning districts, without requiring that a special overlay be applied to such residential parcels. However, as in those rules described above, the City Commission still does require that accessory dwelling units comply with setbacks and technical requirements. The foregoing analysis merely scratches the surface of the referenced ordinances and statutes but can be applied to new and existing zoning regulatory schemes across the country. Such regimes may include, among other things, blanket increases in permitted density, loosened restrictions on short-term rentals, or development incentives offered in exchange for the construction of affordable housing units. By carefully reviewing the language of any new zoning regulatory scheme, developers may find a viable strategy for capitalizing on affordability-based zoning changes. In doing so, such persons may find unique opportunities to increase their projects' density and profitability. While accessory dwelling units are not independently transferable, even a larger scale developer may still benefit by offering units that are more attractive to potential buyers (such as by offering a source of passive income) thereby commanding higher prices. Other affordability-based zoning changes would likely offer additional opportunities. In each case, developers and their counsel will need to review each specific zoning rule at issue to determine how and whether compliance with the rule will be technically and economically feasible and beneficial.

Vaccinated Chileans shout and dance for study to see if the show can go on for concerts,2379,"SANTIAGO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Vaccinated Chileans on Thursday night attended the first of a series of concerts that will be studied in a clinical trial to see if mass events like concerts can safely resume without spreading COVID. The trial is the result of a tie-up between Chile's Musical Authors and Performers' Society and the University of Chile to assess contagion risks at such events and try to get the live music industry back on its feet after the near-fatal blow dealt by the COVID pandemic and lengthy lockdowns in Chile. A total of 200 seats will be available for each of three concerts given by local rock band Chancho En Piedra over the next three months in a carefully ventilated venue in the capital Santiago. Attendees must show proof of vaccination, wear masks and submit to PCR tests prior to the event and again eight days after. Preliminary results will be issued in September. Similar trials have been conducted with audiences of several thousand people attending rock concerts in Barcelona and Liverpool and revealed a lower rate of COVID spread than in the community, though in the case of the Liverpool trial, less than half of attendees returned the post-concert COVID test. read more The Chilean trial is unique in that it specifies that attendees must be vaccinated, taking advantage of the fact that Chile has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 70% of its population already fully inoculated. Dr. Alejandro Afani, who is leading the trial at the University of Chile's Clinical Hospital, said a lull in COVID cases in Chile and the high vaccination rate made it an apt moment to try restarting mass events. Eduardo Ibeas, vocalist with the band, said he hoped the participants would take other self-protection measures seriously. ""We want a positive result from this so that live shows can restart as soon as possible,"" he said. Among those queuing up to take pre-concert COVID tests on Thursday was Catalina Osorio. She said she was looking forward to letting her hair down for the first time in a long time. “I think that for our mental health it's really important to be able to access culture, art and music above all, to be able to go back to seeing live artists, jump, shout, sing, that experience that fills your body,"" she said.

Biden shedding support from independent voters as Delta variant spreads - Reuters poll,5158,"NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is shedding support from independents, a crucial voting bloc that helped Democrats win the White House and Congress last year, as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases slows the country's return to normal from the pandemic, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. The drop in support comes at a precarious time for the first-year president, whose administration has been under fire for its handling of the pullout of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. On Thursday, more than a dozen U.S. troops and dozens of civilians were killed when suicide bombers struck the crowded gates of Kabul airport. At home, the COVID-19 pandemic has surged anew, especially in populous Republican-led states such as Florida and Texas that have resisted new restrictions to hamper the spread of the Delta variant of the virus. Despite Biden's push for vaccinations, 39% of U.S. residents have not had even their first shot, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national opinion poll, conducted Aug. 13-19, found that Biden’s net approval among independents dropped by 14 percentage points overall since June, and by 19 points for his handling of the coronavirus. Still, a slim majority of independents - 53% - said they approve of Biden's pandemic response. Independents are turning away from Biden even though most share his concerns about the coronavirus and have consistently joined with Democrats in supporting more preventive measures. The August poll found that 66% of independents support mask requirements at restaurants, gyms and on airplanes, while 25% oppose them. Fifty-five percent say vaccines should be required for people who want to go back to the office, while 37% say they should not. When asked who should be blamed for the resurgence of COVID-19, 47% of independents said unvaccinated people, compared with 12% who blamed Biden. The decline in Biden's popularity is more likely to be a sign of exhaustion with the pandemic than it is about their support for his ideas, said Robert Blendon, a health policy and public opinion expert at the Harvard School of Public Health. Josh Schwerin, a Democratic strategist who worked for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said Biden and Democrats must continue to draw a contrast with their approach and that of Republicans such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has pushed back against mask and vaccine mandates. ""Thousands of Americans are dying as a result,"" he said. BROADER EROSION After largely favoring Biden over Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the 2020 election, independents are now evenly split in their support for the president: 46% approve of Biden’s performance in office, while 46% disapprove. Two months ago, 52% of independents approved of Biden's overall performance, while 38% disapproved. The decline is part of a broader erosion in Biden’s popularity among all Americans as the president deals with the pandemic and the fallout from Afghanistan. Last week, Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that for the first time in his presidency more Americans disapproved of Biden than approved of him. Among all Americans, Biden's net approval for the coronavirus dropped by 21 points from June to August: 55% approved of his handling of the virus, down 10 points from June, while 39% disapproved, which was up by 11 points. His net approval was relatively stable elsewhere - dropping between 3 and 5 points over the same period on the economy, immigration and the environment. It is far too early to say how much the recent drop in public approval will affect Biden's party’s chances of retaining control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. But it does show how closely tied Biden's support is to the coronavirus crisis and how vulnerable he would be politically if the rate of infections does not subside. Last year in his campaign against Trump, Biden made bringing the pandemic to an end a centerpiece of his message, pledging a return to a degree of normalcy by this summer. Instead, a wave of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths, largely among those who have refused to get vaccinated, has bedeviled his administration. ""(Biden) owns the coronavirus issue now,"" said Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver. ""A lot of people thought it would be over by now, and instead it’s back."" Seventeen months into the pandemic, many Americans continue to work from home as employers postpone office reopenings in the face of the Delta variant. Mask wearing is widespread again and there are concerns about a further spike in cases as children return to school. ""It seems like we’re losing the battle now"" with the coronavirus, said José Guerra, 62, an independent from Kingsville, Texas, who took the poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,427 U.S. adults, including 2,033 Democrats, 1,531 Republicans and 527 independents. The findings have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 points for independents. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Gilead Sciences wins reversal of $1.2 bln award in patent case with Bristol Myers,2515,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out a $1.2 billion ruling against Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), finding a patent on a cancer therapy it was accused of infringing was invalid, in a blow to rival Bristol Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). The two companies have been embroiled in a case involving accusations that Yescarta, the CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy from Gilead's Kite Pharma unit, infringed on a patent for a similar therapy from Bristol's Juno Therapeutics. Last year, a federal judge increased the damages from a jury trial and ordered Gilead to pay Bristol Myers $1.2 billion in the patent infringement case. The ruling on Thursday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision. Bristol Myers in a statement said it disagreed with latest ruling and would seek a review of the Federal Circuit’s decision. Gilead and Kite's attorney Josh Rosenkranz of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gilead shares were up 0.3%, while Bristol shares were off 0.5% in midday trading. The Gilead drug, Yescarta, belongs to a class of cutting-edge cancer treatments known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T, which reprograms the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. Gilead bought Kite Pharma, which developed Yescarta, for $11.9 billion in 2017, with the treatment securing U.S. approval that year. It recorded sales of $338 million in the first six months of this year. A jury in 2019 found that Kite willfully infringed and awarded Juno and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which licenses the patent to Juno, $778 million. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez increased the award to $1.2 billion in Los Angeles federal court last year. Memorial Sloan Kettering did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bristol Myers acquired Juno and its CAR-T program with its $74 billion purchase of Celgene in 2019. Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel that the relevant parts of Juno’s patent were invalid because they lacked a sufficient written description and details. Moore was joined by Circuit Judges Sharon Prost and Kathleen O'Malley in the ruling. During a July oral argument, Moore compared the patent's description to trying to identify a specific car by saying it has four wheels.

Global policymakers urge more sharing of COVID-19 vaccine,1075,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - A group of global policymakers tasked with responding to the COVID-19 health crisis on Friday urged nations with large vaccine stocks to share them with programs that distribute them to lower-income counties. In a joint statement, the Multilateral Leaders Taskforce - which includes the heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization - said fewer than 2% of adults in most low-income countries were vaccinated, compared with almost 50% in high-income countries. ""This crisis of vaccine inequity is driving a dangerous divergence in COVID-19 survival rates and in the global economy,"" the group said. It called on the Group of Seven nations - the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom - to ""urgently"" fulfill their vaccine-sharing pledges, noting that fewer than 10% of pledged doses have been shipped. The group also urged nations to eliminate export restrictions on COVID-19 vaccines. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Stellantis production at Italy's Sevel plant to be suspended over chip shortage,1199,"MILAN, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Production at a Stellantis (STLA.MI) plant in Italy making light commercial vehicles will be halted next week due to a semiconductor shortage, a spokesperson for the carmaker said on Friday, confirming a trade union statement.

Poland to offer COVID booster shots to people with reduced immunity,1309,"WARSAW, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Poland will give third doses of COVID-19 vaccine to people with weak immune systems, the health minister said on Friday, as the European Union's biggest eastern member braces for a fourth wave that is already hitting its western neigbours. At around 200 a day, Poland's daily COVID-19 case numbers are a fraction of what they were during the third wave in spring. But with the highly contagious Delta variant already contributing to a rise in infections the country expects the situation to deteriorate in autumn. ""(The Medical Council) accepts the use of a third dose for people with reduced immunity and for now we will dedicate third doses to people who have reduced immunity,"" Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. He said that the third doses would be made available from Sept 1. Poland, a nation of around 38 million people, has fully vaccinated 18.6 million people. However, the number of people coming forward to be vaccinated has decreased over the summer. There is no consensus among scientists and international agencies that a third dose is necessary, but several countries including the United States, Israel, Germany and France have already opted to offer them to older adults and those with weak immune systems.

"BioNTech eyes Rwanda, Senegal for malaria, tuberculosis vaccine production",2733,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccine maker BioNTech (22UAy.DE) said on Friday it was looking into building malaria and tuberculosis vaccine production sites in Rwanda and Senegal, narrowing its search for African locations. The future malaria and tuberculosis vaccines would be based on the so-called messenger RNA technology, also used in its COVID-19 shot, the German drugmaker said. BioNTech did not say when production was likely to start. In July it said it would seek to develop a vaccine for the mosquito-borne illness malaria, eyeing production in Africa, as it seeks to build on its success with Partner (PFE.N) in COVID-19 shots. read more In a meeting with Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, Senegalese President Macky Sall and European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Berlin on Friday, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin affirmed the German biotech firm's intention to manufacture mRNA vaccines on the African continent, BioNTech said. The sites would be near prospective vaccine hubs planned by the World Health Organization (WHO), the company added. The project to develop manufacturing expertise on the African continent marks a longer-term attempt to avoid a repeat of healthcare inequalities brought to the fore by the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO has criticised a COVID-19 vaccine supply gap between industrialised nations and low-income countries, particularly in Africa. Attempts to set up African production of COVID-19 vaccines have been limited so far. Senegal's Institut Pasteur of Dakar (IPD) this month reached a deal with U.S. company MedInstill for the bottling of COVID-19 shots. IPD, however, has yet to secure a partnership with a vaccine patent holder. read more Pfizer and BioNTech last month struck a deal for South Africa's Biovac Institute to process over 100 million doses a year of their vaccine for Africa. Biovac will carry out final production steps and bottling based on imported active substance in a process known as fill and finish. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (JNJ.N) has enlisted South African drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare (APNJ.J) also for the fill and finish process based on imported vaccine substance. Senegal's Institut Pasteur is the only facility in Africa currently producing a vaccine - a yellow fever shot - that is pre-qualified by the WHO, which requires manufacturers to meet strict international standards. There are currently fewer than 10 African manufacturers that produce vaccines against any disease, in Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. The EU has said it wants to back the development of vaccine production hubs in at least three African countries, including Senegal and South Africa.

Pritzker, a Democrat, issued the new policy amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases spurred largely by the Delta variant of the virus and increasing reports of ""breakthrough"" cases in which people already vaccinated get infected. The statewide mask mandate applies to anyone at least two years old and will take effect on Monday. ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" Pritzker told a news conference. ""People can slow the pandemic by masks and vaccinations,"" he said.

"Air China, China Southern narrow quarterly losses as travel rebounds",2422,"BEIJING/SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Air China (601111.SS) and China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) on Friday narrowed losses in the second quarter after a hit from low Lunar New Year traffic, but domestic COVID-19 outbreaks and border closures are set to weigh on the rest of the year. Chinese airline stocks had tumbled following domestic COVID-19 outbreaks in late July that locked down some cities and closed airports, but rebounded recently as China has nearly halted local spread. On Thursday, the city of Nanjing, locked down since late July, resumed commercial flights. Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist destination, will also reopen its airport on Aug. 30, an airport official told Reuters. Third-quarter results will take a hit from the flight cuts, though they were less severe than in the first quarter when outbreaks restricted travel during the normally peak Lunar New Year holiday. Beijing-based Air China, the country's flag carrier, said its net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to 578 million yuan ($89.27 million) from 6.2 billion yuan in the first quarter, taking first-half net loss to 6.8 billion yuan. China Southern Airlines trimmed its loss to 682 million yuan from 4.0 billion yuan in the first quarter for first-half total shortfall of a 4.7 billion yuan. Second-half earnings are expected to receive a boost from the pent-up domestic travel demand during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the week-long National Holiday in the fourth quarter, as health experts expect current outbreaks in China to be contained by end-August. Unlike in most markets, China's domestic capacity has rebounded past pre-COVID levels and airlines have added widebody planes on some local flights because international borders remain closed. Zhong Nanshan, a coronavirus expert who helped shape China's COVID-19 response, told local media that vaccination rate in China is expected to reach 80% by the end of this year. However, despite the higher vaccination rate, hopes for the reopening of Chinese borders have been delayed as Beijing pushes ahead with its ""zero-tolerance"" approach while other countries are learning to live with COVID.

U.S. judge declines to stop J&J from splitting talc liabilities from main business,5011,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge declined to stop Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) from taking steps to offload widespread Baby Powder liabilities from the rest of its business, preserving the option for the healthcare company to move thousands of claims from people who used its talc products to a unit that would file for bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein denied a request from plaintiffs' lawyers to block the move late Thursday. Lawyers for cancer victims wanted her to issue a restraining order against J&J as part of her role overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of one of the company's former talc suppliers. J&J is exploring a plan to move its liabilities from widespread Baby Powder and other talc-related litigation into a newly created business that would later seek bankruptcy protection, Reuters previously reported. The company's talc products are currently housed in a subsidiary called Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. read more ""The court rightly denied the plaintiffs' motion aimed at preventing J&J from engaging in legitimate business transactions, in the event that it chooses to do so,"" said Diane Sullivan, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP lawyer representing J&J, in a statement. The legal skirmish was unusual in that plaintiffs' lawyers were asking the judge to forbid J&J from taking steps the company's lawyers said it had not yet decided whether to pursue. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has previously said it has ""not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate."" The judge is overseeing the bankruptcy case of Imerys Talc America, which once supplied talc to J&J and filed for Chapter 11 court protection amid mounting litigation. Imerys and J&J have since been battling one another over whether J&J is required to cover the former supplier's legal costs under indemnification agreements. Plaintiffs' lawyers argued that allowing J&J to offload its talc liabilities to a unit that would file for bankruptcy would harm Imerys' reorganization. The judge decided it would be improper as part of Imerys' bankruptcy case for her to legally bar J&J from undertaking a hypothetical future restructuring that might result in separating the talc liabilities. She said Imerys could take legal action against J&J should J&J decide to separate its talc liabilities in a way Imerys deems harmful or unlawful. TEXAS TWO-STEP BANKRUPTCY J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. J&J is considering using Texas' ""divisive merger"" law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities, Reuters previously reported. For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation. The maneuver is known among legal experts as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used in recent years. Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company. Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities. A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free. The blue-chip company, which boasts a market value exceeding $450 billion, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J's appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company's talc caused their ovarian cancer. read more Separately, plaintiffs lawyers are seeking a similar restraining order against J&J in a Missouri court. One of those lawyers, Andy Birchfield, said in a statement that he and other lawyers would study the Imerys ruling and continue attempts to prevent J&J from using the Texas law to separate its talc liabilities and steer them toward bankruptcy.

U.S. Supreme Court ends CDC's pandemic residential eviction moratorium,2743,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions imposed by President Joe Biden's administration in a challenge to the policy brought by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups. The justices, who in June had left in place a prior ban that expired at the end of July, granted a request by the challengers to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that was to have run until Oct. 3. Also read: White House calls for 'urgent' action to prevent evictions after Supreme Court decision The challengers argued that the law on which the CDC relied did not allow it to implement the current ban. ""It strains credulity to believe that this statute grants the CDC the sweeping authority that it asserts,"" the court said in an unsigned opinion. ""If a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it,"" the court added. The three liberal justices on the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, all dissented. The White House said it was disappointed by the decision and urged states, local governments, landlords and Cabinet agencies to ""urgently act"" to help prevent evictions. read more The high court had signaled in June that it thought the moratorium was on shaky legal ground, and that such a policy needed to be enacted by Congress rather than being imposed unilaterally by the executive branch. The CDC first issued a moratorium in September 2020 after a prior one approved by Congress expired, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic. Under political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration on Aug. 3 implemented a somewhat narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said in a dissenting opinion that the outcome of the case was not as clear cut as the majority suggested and that the court was not justified in ending the moratorium so quickly at a time when COVID-19 cases are surging. ""The public interest strongly favors respecting the CDC’s judgment at this moment, when over 90 percent of counties are experiencing high transmission rates,"" Breyer wrote. Citing the CDC, he said that a surge of evictions could lead to more infections of the coronavirus. The latest moratorium covered nearly 92% of U.S. counties - those deemed to have ""substantial"" and ""high"" levels of coronavirus transmission. The policy was challenged in federal court by realtor associations in Alabama and Georgia as well as landlords in those two states. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Danish government intervenes to end nurses strike,1398,"COPENHAGEN, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Danish lawmakers on Friday voted through an emergency law which will effectively end a strike among more than 6,000 nurses over pay which has postponed tens of thousands operations and other treatments. More than a tenth of Denmark's nurses went on strike in mid-June after union members voted against a pay deal that their union leadership had approved. read more The emergency law, which was passed on Friday by a majority in parliament, effectively forces through the 5.02% wage increase over the next three years, which the nurses themselves had already rejected. ""I am deeply disappointed that the parliament is ending the conflict, but not taking the necessary political responsibility to rectify decades of unfair wages,” the head of the nurses’ union Grete Christensen said in a statement. Such an intervention is rare in the Nordic country, where agreements on wages and other working conditions traditionally are negotiated by unions and employers through collective bargaining. Denmark has practically avoided a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, easing pressure on an overstretched health service. However, the strike has so far postponed roughly 35,500 surgeries, The Danish Health Authority said on Wednesday, adding that it can take as long as two years to bring down the extraordinary backlog.

Fed Chair Powell's big moment and 3 ways he could play it,5871,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The stakes for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he delivers a speech on Friday, his fourth at the influential Jackson Hole economic symposium hosted each August by the Kansas City Fed, could not be much higher. Investors and traders will hang on his every word, from his assessment of the progress in the labor market and his outlook for inflation, to any details on when and how he'd expect to start trimming the central bank's support for the economy. Perhaps even more importantly, his words will be scrutinized by a White House considering whether to keep him for another four years, or nominate another leader to take over when his term expires in February. ""It’s an opportunity for him. If he really impresses people that he’s on top of all this, then that could really smooth the way for his reappointment,"" says Dartmouth College's Andrew Levin, an adviser to former Chair Janet Yellen and who in recent weeks has publicly advocated for a change in Fed leadership. Yellen, who is now Treasury Secretary, has reportedly told senior advisers to President Joe Biden that she backs reappointing Powell. read more Here are three approaches Powell may take in his speech: UNEVEN OUTLOOK The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has set off a fourth wave of the pandemic in the United States, and for some regions - like much of the South - it has become the worst yet. Assessing its impact is one way Powell could go. For example, infections, hospitalizations and deaths in Florida, the country's fourth-largest state economy, are all at record highs. High-frequency data indicators of consumer behavior show marked drop-offs in restaurant bookings and retail foot traffic there. Still, those declines more likely represent ""a loss of momentum rather than a pullback in economic activity,"" Jefferies Chief Financial Economist Aneta Markowska wrote this week. That dovetails with the line Powell and his colleagues have taken this summer: that consumers and businesses have learned to navigate the riskier health environment. Nearly 1.9 million jobs were created in June and July, though that pace may have moderated in August. Still, many economists expect employment to fully recoup the 22 million jobs lost to COVID shutdowns in 2020 by next year. Overall, the economy has more than retraced the drop in output, and while some economists have lowered estimates for the current quarter, they are merely shifting growth into later periods rather than wiping it off the board. Nodding to all that would put Powell in position to reiterate that the Fed is making progress - perhaps ""substantial further progress"" - toward its goals of full employment and 2% inflation. Clearing that hurdle sets the stage for the start of the ""taper"" later this year, when the Fed is expected to slow its $120 billion a month of bond purchases aimed at keeping rates low and supporting the economy. TAPER TALK Powell may decide to use the speech to shape expectations around when and how the taper may play out. A number of the Fed's more hawkish policymakers engaged in their own effort on that score Thursday, with the heads of three regional banks all stumping for a quick start to the taper. Other policymakers have previously said they'd prefer to see a few more months of data, given the Delta surge. read more Fed policymakers meet to discuss their next moves in mid-September. Even if he doesn't offer any new details, Powell may take the opportunity to remind investors that a reduction in asset purchases is separate from an interest rate hike. The Fed has set separate hurdles for that, and Powell has previously said those will not be met for quite a while. With inflation already running well above target, a growing number of policymakers concerned it may not recede as quickly or definitively as previously expected, and employment still well short of the labor market's true capacity, the Fed may face tough choices ahead. read more IT'S THE FRAMEWORK, STUPID Powell could push back against emerging criticism of the new framework, which allows for more tolerance for above-target inflation in deference to allowing the economy to run ""hot"" long enough to foster the kind of robust labor market that had taken hold just before the pandemic. Powell unveiled the framework at last year's Jackson Hole conference when the biggest threat to recovery was seen to be the enormous jobs hole left by COVID. Few, if any, policymakers imagined inflation - then running at barely half their target - would emerge so quickly as a force to be reckoned with, perhaps at the expense of completing their work helping the job market fully rebound. Powell could argue that jobs and inflation are not in conflict, that they are not on course for an either-or moment when policymakers must sacrifice the one to contain the other. Many of the factors driving inflation now do appear connected to the task of restarting a $20 trillion economy, and some - like used car prices - are already showing signs of moderating. Moreover, even those inside the Fed most anxious about inflation concede the last several months of rapid price increases have not resulted in a material lift to inflation expectations, which should anchor a return to a more palatable inflation situation. Even this approach comes with some risk, potentially leaving Powell to look defensive about rather than confident in his new policy blueprint. And addressing the issue at all could be a tacit acknowledgement of a deeper debate underway. On the first anniversary of the framework, though, it's arguably the moment for a full-throated defense of a change in monetary policy that will define Powell's legacy if it works, and which has been a key reason even some of the most progressive allies of Biden support his renomination.

Experts recommend booster COVID shots for higher-risk groups in China-official,948,"BEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Experts in China have recommended making booster COVID-19 doses available to specific groups, such as employees at higher risk of exposure to the virus and those who have weak immunity or are aged above 60, a health official said on Friday. These people should get booster shot six months after completing their regular vaccination regimens, Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission, told a news briefing. Zheng did not say whether China has already started giving booster shots, or when it would start. Booster doses were appropriate for people working in the aviation industry, customs, borders, quarantine sites and specific medical institutions, as well as those who travel abroad to places where the virus is still spreading, Zheng said. Further studies were needed to determine whether booster shots should be given to everyone, Zheng said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand keeps curbs until next week to beat Delta; Auckland shut for longer,3315,"WELLINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand on Friday extended pandemic restrictions by four days after which they will be eased slightly, although businesses and schools will remain shut and the biggest city Auckland will be locked down for longer. New Zealand had been largely virus-free, barring a small number of cases in February, but that changed last week after an outbreak of the Delta coronavirus variant erupted, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a nationwide lockdown. The outbreak, which has so far infected nearly 350 people, may be reaching its peak, Ardern said at a news conference. ""We may be seeing the beginning of a plateau of cases,"" Ardern said. ""But caution is still required."" She ordered all of New Zealand, except Auckland and Northland, the country's northernmost region, to move one step lower to alert level 3 restrictions from Wednesday, Sept. 1. This means businesses can only operate for online orders and contactless services, and bars and restaurants remain shut except for takeaways. Public venues remain closed, while the number of people at weddings and funerals are limited to 10 people. ""Yes, you might be able to order some food, but there is not a lot more in terms of freedoms,"" Ardern acknowledged. Meanwhile, nearly 2 million people residing in Auckland and neighbouring Northland will remain in full level 4 lockdown, possibly for another 2 weeks, Ardern said. BUSINESSES DISAPPOINTED A vaccination centre sign directs the public during a lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Auckland, New Zealand, August 26, 2021. REUTERS/Fiona Goodall The country reported 70 new cases of COVID-19 in the community on Friday, all in the epicentre Auckland, taking the total number of cases to 347. Ardern's tough lockdowns and international border closure in March 2020 helped rein in COVID-19, but the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just about 21% of the country's 5.1 million people has been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Leeann Watson said the lockdown extension was ""disappointing"". ""While the government absolutely has to weigh any decision-making with the impact on public health, the reality is that ongoing lockdowns cannot be part of our long-term future,"" Watson said. Mike Toweel, the founder of LED Display and Sign Specialist firm VitrineMedia NZ, told Reuters the lockdowns have been ""heartbreaking"" for small businesses. ""We are all stakeholders in the New Zealand economy,"" Toweel said in a phone interview from Sydney. The Australian has been unable to return to New Zealand due to the border restrictions. ""What the New Zealand government does not address is that every time they have this knee-jerk reaction they put another chink in the armour of business confidence."" Ardern has defended the government's position, saying elimination was the right strategy until everyone is vaccinated. ""Our goal at the moment is to vaccinate more people than any other country in the world and at this rate New Zealand is doing very well,"" she said.

French consumer confidence holding up despite COVID curbs,1987,"PARIS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - French consumers were only marginally less confident about their economic prospects in August despite a surge in coronavirus cases and new rules requiring a health pass to enter many retail outlets, a monthly survey showed on Friday. The INSEE official statistics agency said its monthly consumer confidence index fell to 99 from 100 in July, just short of the average expectation for 100 in a Reuters poll of 10 economists. The index had peaked at 102 in June - the highest since the pandemic started - as vaccination rates picked up and coronavirus restrictions were eased. But with France now facing its fourth coronavirus wave as the Delta variant spreads, the government began requiring people earlier this month to show proof of vaccination to enter cafes, restaurants, trains and big shopping malls. Nonetheless, the survey found that the proportion of households considering that it is a good time to make large purchases remained stable in August above the long-term average while saving intentions rose for the first time in three months. Concerns about unemployment were also unchanged from July with 'help wanted' signs increasingly popping up as companies face growing trouble finding staff. The share of households expecting prices to rise in the coming months rose slightly as strained supply chains increasingly leave firms little choice but to raise their prices. The relatively small decline in consumer confidence suggests that at least for now the new health pass is having a limited impact on economic activity even though it has fuelled regular weekend protests across the country. After a stronger than expected first half of the year, French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday the bank could raise its 2021 growth forecast of 5.75% when it updates its estimates next month, adding that economic impact from the Delta variant was expected to be limited.

Hundreds of displaced families seek food and shelter in Kabul,2513,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Afghan families who have been camping in searing heat at a Kabul park after the Taliban overran their provinces begged for food and shelter on Thursday, the most visible face of a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the war-torn country. The Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan this month, culminating in the capture of Kabul on Aug. 15, has thrown the country into turmoil. read more While thousands of people have crowded the airport to try to flee, many others, like the families in the park, are stuck in limbo, unsure whether it is safer to try to go home or stay where they are. ""I'm in a bad situation,"" said Zahida Bibi, a housewife, sitting under the blazing sun with her large family. ""My head hurts. I feel very bad, there is nothing in my stomach."" Ahmed Waseem, displaced from northern Afghanistan said those in the park were hoping the central government would pay attention. ""We are in an open field and in the heat,"" he said. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters the group was not providing food to the people at the park and others at the airport because it would lead to further overcrowding. They should return to their homes, he said. Afghanistan's western-backed president and many other officials fled after government forces melted away in the face of the Taliban advance. The group has placed its members in ministries and ordered some officials back to work, but services are yet to resume, with banks still closed. read more Phalwan Sameer, also from northern Afghanistan, said his family came to Kabul after the situation rapidly deteriorated in his home town.

EXCLUSIVE U.S. urges Mexico to clear migrant camps near border -sources,2689,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The United States has urged Mexico to clear ad-hoc camps housing thousands of migrants in border cities due to concerns they pose a security risk and attract criminal gangs, officials familiar with the matter said. Facing domestic criticism over a jump in illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has pressed Mexico to curb the flow of migrants to help ease pressure on the nearly 2,000 mile (3,200 km) frontier. Two of the biggest camps to have sprung up in northern Mexico are in the city of Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, and in Tijuana, opposite San Diego, California. Government officials and migrant advocates say the Reynosa camp is home to at least 2,500 people, is unsanitary and has drawn drug gang members looking to recruit desperate migrants. The Tijuana camp is of a similar size, rights groups say. For weeks, the U.S. government has been asking Mexico to clear the camps, in part because the sheer volume of people in them could jeopardize security if they made a sudden rush for the border, two officials familiar with the matter said. Asylum-seeking migrants are pictured at a makeshift camp after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered to uphold an immigration policy implemented under former President Donald Trump that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings, at El Chaparral crossing port with the U.S., in Tijuana, Mexico August 25, 2021. REUTERS/Jorge Duenes/ The State Department and the White House declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. Mexico's Foreign Ministry did not reply to requests for comment. The National Migration Institute declined to comment. The officials emphasized the importance of eradicating conditions that encouraged cartel members to try to extort migrants, or to pressure them into joining their ranks. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Biden to comply with a Texas-based federal judge's ruling to revive a Trump administration immigration policy that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings. That has alarmed Mexican officials, who are concerned the country will struggle to cope with more people after the number of apprehensions or expulsions by U.S. agents of migrants crossing the border more than doubled this year. Mexican authorities have stepped up efforts to expel migrants in the country illegally, many from Central America. In the past few weeks it has sent thousands of them to southern Mexico by plane in order to speed up the process. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
WHO begins shipping Chinese vaccines despite some misgivings,4495,"BRUSSELS/JOHANNESBURG/JAKARTA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's pandemic programme plans to ship 100 million doses of the Sinovac (SVA.O) and Sinopharm COVID-19 shots by the end of next month, mostly to Africa and Asia, in its first delivery of Chinese vaccines, a WHO document shows. The Chinese shipments will help the sputtering global COVAX vaccine sharing programme which is far behind its pledge to deliver 2 billion doses this year following supply problems and export curbs imposed by major producer India. It could also boost Beijing's vaccine diplomacy efforts despite concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese shots, which have been turned down or paired with boosters from Western manufacturers by some of the recipient countries. Of the 100 million Chinese vaccines, half will be provided by Sinopharm and half by Sinovac, with deliveries planned for ""July to September 2021"", a WHO document dated July 29 says. About 10 million Sinopharm shots had been shipped by mid-August, a spokesperson for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), which co-leads COVAX along with the WHO, told Reuters. Sinopharm, Sinovac and China's trade ministry did not respond to requests for comment about when the Chinese vaccines would be delivered. The Chinese vaccines have been allocated to 60 countries, mostly in Africa, which is expected to receive a third of the 100 million doses. However, not all countries want the Chinese vaccines. South Africa is listed by COVAX as one of Africa's largest recipients of Chinese shots with an allocation of 2.5 million Sinovac doses, but a senior health official told Reuters the country was currently unable to accept the vaccines. ""There is not enough information on effectiveness against the Delta variant and there is no data on Sinovac in populations with HIV,"" said Nicholas Crisp, a deputy director-general in the health department who is overseeing the vaccine rollout. ""We have not accepted the COVAX Sinovac because it is premature in our evaluation and planning process,"" he told Reuters. Sinovac did not immediately respond to a request for comment about South Africa's stance. Nigeria, the main recipient of Chinese shots in Africa under COVAX with an allocation of nearly 8 million Sinopharm doses, has approved that vaccine but has called it a ""potential"" option for the country's inoculation campaign. BOOSTERS TO CHINESE SHOTS A GAVI spokesperson declined to comment on South Africa and Nigeria and noted that other countries had not been included in this round, with one of the reasons being that some had decided not to receive the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. Officials from Kenya, Rwanda, Togo and Somalia, which are entitled to smaller COVAX shipments, said they had no concerns about the Chinese shots because they had been vetted by the WHO and more people needed to be inoculated as soon as possible. COVAX's allocation of Chinese vaccines comes after the WHO gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm shot in May and Sinovac in June. GAVI has secured a combined supply of up to 550 million vaccines from the two companies until next year. Including the Chinese vaccines, the facility expects to deliver about 500 million doses by the end of September, its latest forecast shows. It has so far shipped 215 million vaccines, mostly AstraZeneca's (AZN.L). read more Ukraine is the only country in Europe on the COVAX list for Chinese shots and is set to receive about 160,000 Sinovac doses. Asian countries are expected to receive more than 25 million Chinese vaccines, of which nearly 11 million Sinovac doses would go to Indonesia, making it the largest recipient of Chinese shots through COVAX. Other vaccines will go to countries in Latin America and the Middle East. Indonesia has decided to give boosters, largely with the Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine, to healthcare workers - who have mostly been immunised with Sinovac shots. That mirrored similar moves in other countries that have deployed Sinovac shots, such as Brazil and Chile. Healthcare workers are a small portion of those vaccinated in Indonesia, but the booster policy has been interpreted by many as a sign of decreasing confidence in Sinovac. Asked why Indonesia was buying the vaccine, of which the country is a major recipient also through bilateral deals, an official at the Indonesian health ministry told Reuters: ""Sinovac could assure us of the amount they could deliver.""

"Malaysia's new PM retains finance minister, senior figures in cabinet",3625,"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob unveiled his cabinet on Friday, re-appointing the finance minister and several others from the previous administration, in the hope of restoring political stability amid a COVID-19 crisis. Ismail Sabri was sworn in as prime minister last week, succeeding Muhyiddin Yassin who had resigned after failing to cling onto a razor-thin majority in parliament. read more He takes charge as public anger grows over the government's floundering attempts to contain a surge in COVID-19 cases and revive an economy battered by extended lockdowns, with the central bank slashing its 2021 growth forecast twice this year. Ismail Sabri named as finance minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz, who had held the post in Muhyiddin's administration. He also named four senior ministers to head the international trade, defence, works and education portfolios, all of whom had served in the previous government. ""The formation of this cabinet is a re-formulation based on the current situation, in order to maintain stability and prioritising the interests and safety of the Malaysian people above all,"" Ismail Sabri said in a televised address. He said each ministry will need to prove its early achievements within the first 100 days, adding that the government aimed to reopen economic activities in stages with the coronavirus expected to become endemic. The Southeast Asian nation has the highest per capita COVID-19 infection rate in the region, with more than 1.6 million reported cases, including 15,211 deaths. On Thursday, it reported a daily record of 24,599 new coronavirus cases and 393 fatalities. Vaccination rates, however, have ramped up. Nearly half of Malaysia's 32 million population are fully vaccinated, including 60.2% of all adults. Khairy Jamaluddin, who had spearheaded Malaysia's inoculation programme as science minister, will now be in charge of the health ministry, swapping portfolios with Adham Baba, who will oversee the vaccine roll-out next, Ismail Sabri said. The presence of familiar figures in the cabinet line-up raised doubts on whether the new administration will be up to the task of avoiding the previous government's mistakes, amid public fury over its flip-flopping lockdown policies and failure to act against politicians who violated rules. ""It's not a reformulated cabinet, it's a sort of mutually reshuffled cabinet in the sense with the same old faces, mutually exchanging some ministerial portfolios,"" said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore's Institute of International Affairs. ""I don't keep a lot of hope on this new cabinet being able to perform any better than the last cabinet, because they are the same old people."" Ismail Sabri's appointment saw the return of his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to the top office, after it was toppled in an election three years ago amid widespread corruption allegations. He is Malaysia's third prime minister since the 2018 polls, after UMNO pulled its backing for Muhyiddin last month, citing his failure to manage the pandemic. Analysts have said Ismail Sabri could face instability as well, with continued infighting within UMNO while coalition partners such as Muhyiddin's alliance have said its support for the new premier was conditional on him taking a strong stand against graft. Several UMNO leaders were charged with corruption after the election, including president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and former premier Najib Razak, who remain influential figures within the party.

Japan's July factory output to fall as Delta variant spreads in Asia: Reuters poll,2050,"TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output likely fell in July as export demand for capital goods stagnated and supply chains were further disrupted by the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant in Asia, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. The poll also showed retail sales, a key barometer of consumer spending, were expected to post a fifth straight month of year-on-year gains in July, helped by growing demand for electronics and clothing. Factory output was projected to have fallen 2.5% from the previous month in the poll of 18 economists, dropping into contraction after a sharp 6.5% jump in June, the highest growth since July 2020. ""With the chip shortage issue, the global spread of the Delta variant and particularly its impact on parts supply from Southeast Asia puts pressure on production"" by Japanese manufacturers, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities attributed the expected output drop to weak Asia-bound machinery exports, while adding that a recovery in car production was likely to offset some of the decline. For retail sales, analysts in the poll forecast growth of 2.1% from the same month a year earlier, picking up speed after a 0.1% increase in June. But pressure from the health crisis was likely to remain a drag on consumption trends, with the year-on-year figure expected to be skewed due to statistical base effects reflecting last year's slide. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will publish retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Aug. 30 (2350 GMT Aug. 29) and factory output at 8:50 a.m. Aug. 31 (2350 GMT Aug. 30). The country's unemployment rate in July was expected to hold steady at 2.9% in the Friday poll. The jobs-to-applicants ratio, a measure of jobs' availability, was forecast to fall to 1.12 from 1.13 in June. Job figures will be released by the labour ministry at 8:30 a.m. Aug. 31 (2330 GMT Aug. 30) and housing starts data will be issued at 2 p.m. Aug. 31 (0500 GMT).

China submits draft biodiversity declaration to United Nations,2002,"SHANGHAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China will urge countries to recognise the importance of biodiversity in human health and endorse key Chinese Communist Party slogans about protecting natural ecosystems, according to a draft declaration submitted to the United Nations this week. China wants the ""Kunming Declaration"" to be agreed by all parties ahead of delayed ""COP 15"" biodiversity talks due to take place in October in the southwestern city of Kunming, with the aim of sealing a new global treaty. The ""zero draft"" of the declaration, published on the official website of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity on Thursday, includes the key Chinese Communist Party concept of ""ecological civilisation"". It also includes the formulation of ""lucid water and lush mountains"", first used in a 2005 speech by President Xi Jinping and included in dozens of Chinese policy documents and propaganda campaigns since he became leader in 2012. The document also calls on parties to ""mainstream"" biodiversity protection in decisionmaking, and recognise the importance of conservation in protecting human health - a prominent theme among China's leaders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been blamed on wildlife trading and ecosystem destruction. China wants the international community to sign the declaration during the virtual Kunming talks on Oct. 11, with the aim of building a consensus behind a more detailed global treaty to be finalised in person next May. Governments have been invited to give their ""feedback"" to the draft before Sept. 6, according to a covering letter sent to the United Nations by Chinese environment minister Huang Runqiu. ""Ambition will need to be built up over the next month,"" said Li Shuo, senior climate advisor with the environment group Greenpeace in Beijing.

Most of the channels offer regular full-throated support to President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has been sowing doubts about the credibility of next year's vote. The president is down in the polls after overseeing the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak and a weak economy. ""We reinforce our commitment to collaborating with the work of authorities in Brazil and to continue to invest in policies, resources and products to protect the YouTube community from harmful content,"" Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube said in a statement announcing the move. Last week, the inspector general of electoral justice, Luis Felipe Salomão, ordered YouTube, Twitch.TV, Twitter (TWTR.N), Instagram and Facebook (FB.O) to suspend payments to people and pages that were spreading disinformation about the Brazilian electoral system. In July, YouTube said it had removed videos from Bolsonaro's channel for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, becoming the latest tech giant to pull his pandemic pronouncements.

Mexican researchers say they created facemask that neutralizes COVID-19,1421,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) have created a facemask using silver and copper nanolayers that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the university's official gazette said on Thursday. UNAM is calling the triple-layered antimicrobial facemask SakCu; Sak means silver in Mayan and Cu is the chemical symbol for copper. To test the mask, researchers took drops with the virus from COVID-19-positive patients at the Hospital Juarez in Mexico and placed them on the silver-copper film deposited in polypropylene. UNAM said that if the viral concentration was high, the virus disappeared by more than 80% in about eight hours and if the viral load was low, in two hours none of the virus RNA was detected. ""Upon contact with the silver-copper nanolayer, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane breaks and its RNA is damaged,"" the gazette said. ""Thus, even if SakCu is disposed of improperly, it will not be a problem as it does not remain contaminated, like many of the masks that are thrown away."" The facemask is reusable and can be washed up to 10 times without losing its biocide properties. UNAM is not mass-producing the facemask and said that it currently has the capacity to produce 200 of them per day. The research was led by UNAM's Materials Research Institute.

"Peru's Congress pushes Cabinet confirmation vote to Friday, extending uncertainty",3641,"LIMA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Peru's Congress on Thursday pushed back to Friday a key vote to confirm or reject a new leftist Cabinet nominated by President Pedro Castillo, extending the uncertainty in a country where conflicts between the executive and legislature loom large. Castillo, who took office just last month, is Peru's fifth president in five years due to those tensions, which included several impeachment proceedings against previous leaders. The vote of confidence is a key test for his fledging presidency. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Guido Bellido asked Congress for a ""yes"" vote and outlined plans to lift Peru out of ""one of the most grave political, social, environmental and health crises of recent decades."" Bellido began his speech in quechua, the most common indigenous language in Peru, which prompted the head of the legislature to ask him to speak in Spanish because she could not understand him. Castillo won a deeply divisive election this year, beating his rival by a margin of 0.25 percentage point. But he won overwhelming support in quechua-speaking parts of the country. . Lawmakers publicly debated throughout the afternoon, although it was not possible in many cases to know which way they would vote. It is still unclear whether the Cabinet will be confirmed or not. Castillo belongs to the Marxist-Leninist Free Peru party, which is allied to a more moderate leftist group in Congress. But put together they hold only a third of all votes. They need a simple majority for confirmation. In the not unlikely event that the Cabinet is rejected by the center-right coalition that runs Peru's Congress, Castillo will have to present a new Cabinet led by a new prime minister. But if Congress rejects this second Cabinet as well, Castillo would have the option to close Congress instead, while keeping his Cabinet in place. ""I wish to ratify the commitment of President Castillo to develop public policies and actions that herald a new stage in the life of the country where peace, democracy and equal opportunities for all prevail,"" said Bellido, promising ""important changes in economic and state structures."" As Bellido spoke, dozens of people demonstrated outside both in favor of and against Castillo's Cabinet, in a sign of the country's persistent political divide. POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS Bellido offered several policy announcements in his speech, including that Peru will step up efforts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and asked for legislative powers for the executive on tax matters. He said the government intends to tap the excess profits of mining companies at times of high international prices of raw materials. Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer and mining is the engine of the Andean country's economy. Among projects the government would push, he added, was a railway running from the Andes to the Pacific to carry passengers and mining goods, to be funded through a public-private alliance with international partners. Bellido, who is also Cabinet chief, addressed Congress amid calls for his resignation and those of other members of the government who belong to the Peru Libre party, which brought Castillo to power. He faces an investigation into an alleged ""apology for terrorism"" over old Facebook posts in which he appeared to defend a former rebel from the Shining Path Maoist group. Bellido denies the accusation and no charges have been filed. Government sources had suggested that Castillo would seek to reshuffle his Cabinet in a bid to stave off its rejection by Congress, but in the end no changes were made.

The court found that the EPA did not reasonably explain under the Clean Air Act (CAA) why it found the plans' reliance on a measure that would, if all else failed, cut the sales of a paint that contributes to ozone formation was a sufficient plan B. EPA spokesperson Ken Labbe said the agency is reviewing the decision. Brent Newell, a lawyer for the plaintiff, the Association of Irritated Residents (AIR), said: ""The EPA has failed to ensure that Californians have meaningful air-pollution controls and the court has recognized how severe the air-pollution problem is for Valley residents."" Ozone's effects on human health -- depending on the level of exposure -- range from causing coughing to aggravating asthma. AIR petitioned the court in 2019. In a filing, it says the San Joaquin Valley is ""one of the most polluted air basins"" nationwide. The EPA in 2012 classified it as an extreme nonattainment area for the 8-hour ozone standard, according to the ruling. The CAA requires that certain plans seeking to cut ozone concentration include additional, back-stop measures, called contingency measures, in the event it fails. The contingency measure local air regulators elected was the elimination of an exemption restricting the sale of architectural paint like aerosolized coatings in containers of one liter or less, the ruling and briefs said. The EPA estimated the move would achieve one ton per day of reductions in volatile organic compounds, which play a significant role in the formation of ozone, a plaintiff's brief says. In its complaint, AIR said that under long-standing EPA policy, contingency measures must achieve more than 11 tons per day of ozone-forming emissions reductions. The EPA countered that the CAA doesn't ""specify the quantity of emission reductions that a contingency measure must provide"" and that ""surplus emissions reductions"" tied to existing programs, like those controlling emissions from cars, should count toward strengthening a contingency plan. U.S. Circuit Judge Eric Miller disagreed. ""Already-implemented measure"" cannot ""be a basis for declining to establish contingency measures,"" he said. The panel, however, rejected AIR's claim that EPA's approval of an additional program, which the agency says strengthens the state's plan, violates the CAA because it is unenforceable. The program is enforceable because it can require the production of a report, the panel said. Miller was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Mark Bennett and, sitting by designation, U.S. District Judge Benita Pearson. The case is AIR v. USEPA, et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-71223.

China reports 32 new coronavirus cases for Aug 26 vs 26 day ago,746,"BEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China reported 32 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland for Aug. 26, compared with 26 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission on Friday. Two of the new infections were locally transmitted, the health authority said. That compares with three local cases a day earlier. One of the new local cases was found in Shanghai, and the other was in Jiangsu province. China reported 22 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, which it does not classify as confirmed infections. There were 19 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported. As of Aug. 26, mainland China had recorded 94,765 confirmed cases, with a cumulative death toll unchanged at 4,636.

"U.S. payrolls, euro zone inflation, Asian PMIs",3142,"NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. payrolls for August, euro zone inflation and Asia purchasing managers surveys - here's a quick look ahead to next week's top economic events and themes to be covered by Reuters bureaus. UNITED STATES It's all about jobs next week with nonfarm payrolls for August on tap on Friday morning ahead of the long weekend for the Labor Day holiday. Nearly 1.9 million jobs were created in June and July, and it's a toss-up among economists whether that pace can be sustained. The preliminary Reuters estimate pegs jobs growth at 763,000 for August, but watch for updated forecasts early in the week and potentially after Wednesday's ADP's private-sector jobs report. An extension of the previous two months' gains could be enough for Federal Reserve officials to declare they have made ""substantial further progress"" toward maximum employment and price stability goals. That could set up a decision - or at least a more heated debate - on the much-awaited ""tapering"" of the central bank's $120 billion a month of bond purchases at their September meeting. EUROPE In Europe, the most eagerly anticipated news is the first estimate of euro zone inflation for August on Tuesday. Market expectations are for 2.7% year-on-year, above the July figure of 2.2% and moving ever further away from the ECB’s target of close to but not exceeding 2%. Still, it is unlikely that this alone will prompt a re-think of the current ECB view that price pressures are transitory and that stimulus policies can continue well into next year. The German economy, the region’s largest, has been producing mixed signals of late with downbeat business and consumer morale figures suggesting growing concern about coronavirus infections and the impact of supply chain snags. Wednesday’s retail sales index for July may do little to brighten the picture with most analysts expecting a sharp fall from the bounce they got the month before – and some analysts even expecting a fall month-on-month. Britain meanwhile has been suffering more than most from supply and labour shortages as COVID-19 and semiconductor-related factors are compounded by a post-Brexit exodus of skilled workers. The final and complete read-out of Markit/CIPS index of Purchase Managers’ views of the economy – both for manufacturing and services – in August may offer further clues to its overall health on Friday. ASIA Purchasing managers index surveys highlight the agenda in Asia next week, and they may show if the factory closure woes that have been afflicting the region as the Delta variant of the coronavirus spreads have materially worsened or improved. It kicks off Tuesday with China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) PMI, which barely registered growth in July and sits at the lowest since January 2020 coming into the month. That is followed on Wednesday by PMI reports across Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Last month's reports showed divisions in the region, with continued strength in Japan and South Korea and Delta-driven slumps across most of Southeast Asia.

Rite Aid settles bellwether opioid case with Ohio counties,3106,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp affiliates have settled claims by two Ohio counties that it contributed to the opioid addiction epidemic, just over a month before the case was set to go to trial. The pharmacy chain operator and Lake and Trumbull counties disclosed the settlement in a motion filed Wednesday in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, to sever Rite Aid from the case. They did not reveal terms of the deal, which must be approved by Lake County Commissioners and Trumbull County Commissioners. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster granted the motion on Thursday. Frank Gallucci of Plevin & Gallucci, a lawyer for the counties, had no immediate comment. Rite Aid and its lawyer Kelly Moore of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The judge is presiding over a multidistrict litigation including more than 3,000 cases over opioids brought by local governments around the country against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies. The two counties' case against Rite Aid and others was chosen as a bellwether, or test case, of public nuisance claims against pharmacies. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc remain as defendants in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 4. The counties accuse them of overlooking red flags that opioids were being illegally diverted. The pharmacies previously reached a settlement with two counties in New York, where another trial is currently under way, but have yet to propose a nationwide settlement of opioid claims against them. They face another trial next year in a case brought by San Franciso. Other defendants in the opioid litigation have moved in recent months to resolve the claims against them. Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the nation's top three drug distributors - McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc - have offered to pay a combined $26 billion to settle local government's claims against them. However, as of Monday, at least six states had not signed on to that deal, putting the full amount in jeopardy. In addition to the pharmacies, drugmakers AbbVie Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Endo International Inc have not reached nationwide opioid settlements. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its creditors, meanwhile, are seeking approval of a settlement in bankruptcy court that the company values at more than $10 billion. The cases are County of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45032, and County of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45079, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

Pentagon bracing for more attacks after troops killed at Kabul airport,4204,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - American forces in Kabul were bracing for more Islamic State attacks while winding up their evacuation mission, U.S. officials said, as the number of U.S. troops killed in Thursday's suicide bomb attack rose to 13. A U.S. official told Reuters the number of U.S. personnel killed was likely to rise even higher. More than a dozen were wounded. The attack marked the first U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020 and represented the deadliest incident for American troops in the country in a decade. At least two explosions tore through crowds that had thronged the gates of Hamid Karzai International Airport desperate to leave Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power almost two weeks ago ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw American troops after two decades. In a statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility and said one of its suicide bombers had targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army."" Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, told a news briefing the explosions were followed by gunfight. McKenzie said the threat from Islamic State persists alongside ""other active threat streams."" ""We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue - and we're doing everything we can to be prepared,"" McKenzie said. McKenzie added that future potential attacks could include rockets being fired at the airport or car bombs attempting to get in. McKenzie said he saw nothing that would convince him that Taliban forces had let the attack take place. The U.S. military said that in addition to the 13 killed, 18 were injured and in the process of being evacuated on C-17s with surgical units. U.S. officials said one bomb detonated near the airport's Abbey Gate and the other was close to the nearby Baron Hotel. Crowds of people show their documents to U.S. troops outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan August 26, 2021. REUTERS/Stringer RACE AGAINST TIME A massive airlift of U.S. and other foreign nationals and their families as well as some Afghans has been under way since the day before Taliban forces captured Kabul on Aug. 15, capping a swift advance across the country as American and allied troops withdrew. The United States has been racing to carry out the airlift before its military is set to fully withdraw from the country by Aug. 31. McKenzie said the evacuation mission was not going to stop. ""I think we can continue to conduct our mission, even while we are receiving attacks like this,"" McKenzie said, adding that U.S. forces will ""go after"" the perpetrators of Thursday's attack. McKenzie said there were about 1,000 U.S. citizens estimated to be still in Afghanistan. A spokesperson for the State Department said more than two thirds of these Americans had informed it they were taking steps to leave Afghanistan. Islamic State militants have emerged in Afghanistan as enemies both of the West and the Taliban. A 2001 U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban from power after the group had harbored the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The U.S. military death toll in the Afghanistan war since 2001 stood at roughly 2,500. Afghan health officials were quoted as saying 60 civilians died, but it was not clear whether that was a complete count. Video uploaded by Afghan journalists showed dozens of bodies and wounded victims strewn around a canal on the edge of the airport. U.S. officials have said there are about 5,200 American troops providing airport security. The attacks came after the United States and allies had urged Afghans to leave the area around the airport because of a threat by Islamic State. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul a day earlier had advised Americans to avoid traveling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified ""security threats."" The United States and its allies have mounted one of the biggest air evacuations in history, bringing out about 95,700 people, including 13,400 on Wednesday, according to the White House.

Ruling on Purdue Pharma opioid settlement pushed back to next week,2076,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday he now anticipates a ruling on OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan on Wednesday of next week instead of this week because he needs more oral argument on certain issues. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain was originally expected to rule on Friday, Aug. 27. Drain did not specify the issues on which he needs to hear more. If Drain approves the deal, it would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future litigation. The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, would dissolve the drugmaker and shift assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company would be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic in U.S. communities that alleged the company and its owners aggressively marketed the painkiller OxyContin while playing down its abuse and overdose risks. The plan also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks circulated legislation to block such legal releases and urged the Justice Department to appeal the plan, efforts that failed to gain traction. The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid epidemic. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct. The Purdue bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members. The contribution is in the form of cash that would be paid over roughly a decade and value from relinquishing control of charitable institutions. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2nd Circuit won't enjoin New York anti-abortion protesters,2988,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday refused to enter an injunction against anti-abortion protesters who were accused by the state of violating laws meant to ensure patients' access to abortion clinics without interference or harassment. The unanimous panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not address the merit of the case, which Senior Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi said involved ""difficult, unresolved, issues of state law,"" instead finding only that U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon had not abused her discretion in denying the injunction. Calabresi was joined by Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston and Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler. ""It's a very good ruling,"" said Martin Cannon of the Thomas More Society, a lawyer for the protesters. ""The trial court is entitled to considerable discretion when it makes findings of fact."" The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, which had sued the protesters on behalf of patients of the Choices clinic in the New York City borough of Queens, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state sued the 13 protesters in 2017, alleging that protesters crowded women trying to enter the clinic, made death threats to people trying to escort them and blocked their path with posters purportedly of aborted fetuses. It said those actions violated the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, the state's New York State Clinic Access Act and New York City's Access to Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act. Amon in July 2018 rejected the state's motion for an injunction against the protests, saying the state had not shown it would face irreparable harm without one. In March of this year, however, the same 2nd Circuit panel as in Thursday's decision, divided 2-1, vacated Amon's denial of the injunction and ruled in favor of the state on a number of legal issues in the case. Livingston dissented, saying the decision unconstitutionally curtailed protesters' First Amendment right to free speech. The protesters sought rehearing, which the panel granted. In Thursday's ruling, Calabresi did not give details about the reasons for the change. He wrote that while ""some members of this Court might have resolved the matter differently in the first instance,"" Amon had not abused her ""considerable discretion"" in denying the injunction. Therefore, he said, ""we do not deem it appropriate to certify to the New York Court of Appeals or to try to resolve these issues ourselves at the instant preliminary injunction stage.""

"Tyson Foods offers $10,000 prizes for vaccinated U.S. chicken workers",1410,"CHICAGO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods (TSN.N) said on Thursday it is offering U.S. chicken plant workers the chance to win $10,000 once a week for the next five weeks if they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine lottery is the latest attempt to encourage vaccinations by the country's biggest meat company by sales, as the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus drives an increase in U.S. cases. Tyson employees at nearly 50 chicken facilities are eligible for the prizes, spokesman Derek Burleson said. The company on Aug. 3 mandated that all employees be vaccinated by Nov. 1, though the requirement for unionized plant workers is subject to negotiations with labor unions. read more At that time, about 56,000 employees had already been vaccinated, roughly 47% of Tyson's U.S. workforce of 120,000, according to the company. read more Tyson said on Thursday that discussions with union leaders on the mandate are ongoing. ""We're already in alignment on the need to continue doing everything we can to protect our team members from the health impacts of the COVID-19 virus,"" Burleson said. Tyson is also paying $200 to any employee who gets vaccinated and compensating workers for up to four hours of regular pay if they are vaccinated outside normal work hours or away from a Tyson location, according to the company.

"Brain fog, total exhaustion: One Big Law associate’s COVID battle",4919,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - As law firms grapple with return-to-office plans, Big Law associate Andrew Kinsey offers a powerful example of why rushing back might be unwise. Kinsey has spent the last two weeks fighting a COVID-19 infection, sharing his symptoms in real time in a series of often-alarming tweets. For example, on the seventh day of his illness he wrote, “It took 15 minutes of slowly changing positions, waiting, moving again, waiting ... but I got from the bed to my chair without throwing up or having to rest for 20 minutes. It sounds pathetic, but this is a huge step.” (Kinsey, a litigation associate in Wilmington, Delaware, did not want to name the mega-firm he works for because he was not speaking on its behalf. A quick Google search revealed he works at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.) To be clear, he’s not dying or about to go on a ventilator. He’s fully vaccinated and is now largely recovered from what he figures was a “mild” Delta-variant case. “The vaccine did its job and I have no lung issues,” he said. Still, Kinsey, 38, told me that he’s never been sicker in his life, flagging “profound exhaustion” as his top symptom, as well as “brain fog.” He’s also got a trial in three weeks. Luckily, his firm has a deep bench, and he hasn’t infected any of his colleagues because hey -- they’re all still working remotely. His co-workers have stepped up to cover for him while he’s been recuperating. But what if they were all in the office together, working down the hall from each other and gathering in a conference room for hours-long brainstorming sessions? According to the CDC, the Delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous COVID strains and can be spread by people who are fully vaccinated. It doesn’t take much imagination to envision the virus tearing through an office. Kinsey’s tweets give a sense of how impossible it would have been to soldier on when sick, trial or no trial. For example, last week he offered observations such as, “Getting up to go to the bathroom caused some intense nausea though, so walking more than 5 feet is still too much” and “My goal today is to be able to watch an hour of TV before I need a break. That goal should give a sense of how much this wipes me out.” Kinsey told me that he’s been motivated to share his experience “to give people a birds-eye view of what it looks like to have a mild case of COVID.” He started feeling ill around August 10 and believes he caught the virus from his 8-year-old daughter. She has underlying health conditions and was hospitalized for several days with COVID. (She has since been released.) After spending four days and nights at her bedside, Kinsey tested positive on August 12. “The worst so far has been fever/muscle weakness and brain fog,” he tweeted on the day of his diagnosis. In the throes of his illness, he found that he couldn’t watch certain television shows because they moved too fast. “I try to think and my brain takes a few seconds to start,” Kinsey tweeted. “I have to be honest,” he tweeted shortly after he got sick. “The only thing that really worries me about my COVID is lingering brain fog. My ability to feed my family relies entirely on my brain functioning properly. I have no idea what my firm would do if I suddenly lost 20+% effectiveness. But it worries me.” According to the Cedars-Sinai blog, COVID-19-related ""brain fog"" is not clearly defined, but “people are using the term to describe the constellation of symptoms such as short-term memory loss, poor attention span and fatigue that plagues up to 20% of COVID-19 patients weeks after they have recovered from typical COVID-19 symptoms.” Kinsey is now back at work, and his fogginess has fortunately dissipated, although he still tires more easily. If he’s got one takeaway, it’s this: Get vaccinated. He’s sure his illness would have been worse without the jab, and if more adults get vaccinated, it protects vulnerable children like his daughter who cannot. If telling his COVID story means “even one person decides to get vaccinated or wear a mask,” he said, “it would be worth it.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Mass. top court backs broad view of law protecting abuse victims,4132,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top state court has ruled that a state law barring retaliation against victims of domestic violence who take time off of work to attend related court hearings or medical appointments still applies when workers do not formally request leave. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in a 5-2 decision on Wednesday revived a lawsuit by Kehle Osborne-Trussell, a nurse who claims Boston Children's Hospital hired and then swiftly fired her after she informed human resources that she planned to enforce a protective order against a person who had abused and was harassing her. Reversing a state judge, the majority held that the state's Domestic Violence and Abuse Leave Act (DVLA) does not require employees to formally request leave, or provide specific dates that they will miss work, for the law's protections to apply. ""A contrary conclusion would be at odds with the remedial purposes of the DVLA to encourage appropriate advance notice and to create a situation in which abuse is not something to remain silent about,"" Justice Dalila Wendlandt wrote for the court. A spokeswoman for the hospital, which is represented by Murphy & Riley, declined to comment. Michael Mason of Bennett & Belfort, who represents Osborne-Trussell, said on Thursday that the ruling should help guide employer's decisionmaking moving forward. ""The Court clarified the extent to which the law protects these vulnerable employees and allows them to get the help they need without fear of losing their jobs,"" Mason said. According to court filings, Osborne-Trussell in late 2018 obtained a harassment prevention order barring her abuser from contacting her or making social media postings that referenced her. The hospital offered Osborne-Trussell a job in February 2019, contingent upon her passing background and licensure checks and passing a medication assessment test. Two weeks later, Osborne-Trussell's abuser posted threats and false statements about her on social media and ""tagged"" the hospital. She reported the incident to local police and to the hospital's human resources department and notified HR that she was pursuing enforcement of the protective order. About two weeks later, the hospital sent Osborne-Trussell a letter terminating her employment six days before she was set to start working, according to court filings. Osborne-Trussell filed a lawsuit in state court accusing the hospital of discriminating and retaliating against her in violation of the DVLA. The hospital moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that Osborne-Trussell was not an ""employee"" under the DVLA because she had never commenced employment with the hospital. And even if the law applied, Osborne-Trussell could not state a claim because she never requested leave related to the harassment, the hospital said. A state judge last year ruled that Osborne-Trussell was the hospital's employee but agreed that she could not pursue a DVLA claim because she never requested leave. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Judicial Court said the hospital's reading of the DVLA would undermine the policy behind the law. Ruling for the hospital could encourage employers to preemptively terminate workers who disclose abuse before they request specific dates for leave, the majority said. Justice Serge Georges in dissent, joined by Justice Frank Gaziano, said the focus of the DVLA ""is on the leave itself, and not simply a reason that could support an eventual request for leave.""

Hamilton says he and Mercedes in better shape for title run,2211,"SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton said both he and his Mercedes team would be in better shape for the second half of the season but the battle with Red Bull and Max Verstappen would be closer and tougher than ever. The Briton has an eight-point lead over his Dutch rival ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix, a race that starts the second phase and will have plenty of vocal Verstappen fans in attendance. ""It’s going to be close, it’s going to be tough this second half of the season,"" said Hamilton, who could take a record-extending 100th win on Sunday. ""The first half was definitely one of the toughest and I expect it’s going to be pretty much the same in the second half, if not more difficult."" The 36-year-old said he was excited to get back, had missed working with the team and being in the car and did not feel more wary of Verstappen's challenge. Verstappen has won five races to Hamilton's four so far this year and would be comfortably ahead but for collisions and misfortune that have left him with only five points from the past two races. ""As we've got through the season they have got stronger and stronger,"" said Hamilton, whose team have won the last seven successive drivers' and constructors' world championships. ""It’s been harder for us as we have gone on, we had a bit of a difficult patch but we got back in terms of operating to how we have in the past. ""We have definitely upped our game... I have no doubts that we will take another step forward in our processes and how we apply ourselves."" Hamilton's health caused concern at the previous race in Hungary when he feared he might be feeling the effects of 'long COVID' after testing positive for the virus in Bahrain last November. He was reluctant to divulge personal health information on Thursday but said he had spent the break ensuring he was in better shape and it was no longer a concern for him. Hamilton has won four times previously at Spa, the longest track on the calendar and one of the fastest, while Verstappen is seeking a first at what was a home circuit before the Dutch Grand Prix was reinstated.

Explainer: Who are the Afghan refugees coming to the U.S. and what happens when they arrive?,5110,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Thousands of Afghans have arrived in the United States since the hurried evacuation of Afghanistan began in mid-August, including many who helped U.S. forces during its 20-year involvement in the country's war. WHY IS THE U.S. MILITARY EVACUATING AFGHANS? President Joe Biden said the United States aimed to evacuate 50,000 to 65,000 Afghan allies before an Aug. 31 deadline for U.S. withdrawal. Biden's estimate appeared to refer to Afghans who have applied for a humanitarian visa known as a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV), and their family members. The U.S. government has declined to say how many Afghans have arrived in the United States since the evacuation from Kabul began or the immigration status of those people. WHAT IS THE SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM? SIV's are available to certain Afghans who aided U.S. forces as interpreters and translators, as well as in other roles, and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, the Islamist militant group that swiftly seized power 11 days ago. An estimated 5,000 SIV applicants have already been evacuated from Afghanistan, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Association of Wartime Allies, a group advocating for SIV applicants in Afghanistan and Iraq. The group estimates that 65,000 SIV applicants and family members remain in Afghanistan. WHO ARE THE AFGHANS ARRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES? U.S. military evacuation flights from Kabul have carried U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Afghan SIV applicants and other vulnerable Afghans, according to the Pentagon. Among the Afghans entering the United States are people with approved SIVs and applicants to the program. Other arriving Afghans may seek U.S. asylum or similar forms of relief, advocates say. Afghans who lack valid immigration status when they arrive in the United States can be permitted to enter for a temporary period via ""humanitarian parole."" The Biden administration has not said how many Afghans have been paroled into the United States, but advocates expect many arrivals will lack visas and require parole. WHAT HAPPENS TO AFGHANS WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN THE UNITED STATES? U.S. evacuation flights so far have landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can go on to their destinations after they have been tested for COVID-19. SIV-eligible Afghans and other Afghan arrivals go to U.S. military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey for processing, according to people familiar with the process. Afghans sent to the military bases receive a health screening and help in applying for work authorization, along with other services. The processing can take anywhere from a day to a week or more, a refugee staffer working at Fort Lee in Virginia told Reuters. After processing at the military bases, Afghans will be connected with a U.S. refugee resettlement organization, a senior U.S. official said.

Afghans seeking SIVs must complete a 14-step application process that includes a visa interview and security screening.

The Biden administration has not said what type of vetting would be applied to any Afghans entering the United States who are not applying to the SIV program. ARE U.S. REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT GROUPS PREPARED? U.S. refugee resettlement organizations typically receive at least two weeks' notice from the U.S. government or United Nations to prepare for new arrivals, but the hectic evacuation has cut that timeline to days or hours. The hurried pace forced one refugee group in Texas to turn to emergency housing and petition for vacant Airbnb (ABNB.O) rental units while others have scrambled to find mattresses and supplies for families. read more U.S. refugee groups and immigration advocates have for months urged the Biden administration to quickly evacuate vulnerable Afghans and were frustrated by what they perceived as a lack of urgency before the Taliban took control of Kabul. At the same time, the resettlement agencies are rebuilding after former President Donald Trump slashed refugee admissions to the lowest level since the U.S. program began in 1980, forcing the groups to cut staff and close offices.

"Slovenian teachers, students will have to take weekly COVID-19 tests",1283,"SARAJEVO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Students and teachers who have not been inoculated against COVID-19 or recovered from the disease will have to take weekly tests, the Slovenian government said on Thursday as infections in the country rose to their highest since May. The government, which earlier this week stopped providing free rapid tests to encourage more people to get vaccinated, said it would cover the costs of testing students. It also said the same conditions - having recovered from the illness or been vaccinated or tested negative, would apply to anyone over 15 taking part in indoor sports and recreational activities, just as it had earlier ruled for public performers. Some local media reported that education authorities have issued instructions that teachers who do not comply with the required conditions should be fired but Reuters could not confirm the reports. Slovenia on Thursday reported 509 new cases of COVID-19, with a positive test rate of 17.3%.

Japan suspends 1.6 mln doses of Moderna shot after contamination reports,4325,"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, more than a week after the domestic distributor received reports of contaminants in some vials. Japan and Moderna said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and the suspension was just a precaution. But the move prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations planned for Thursday and led to the European drugs regulator to launch an investigation into the matter. ""Moderna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its COVID-19 vaccine,"" the U.S. vaccine maker said in a statement, adding it put the lot in question and two adjacent lots on hold. ""The company is investigating the reports and remains committed to working expeditiously with its partner, Takeda, and regulators to address this,"" it added, referring to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), which distributes the vaccine in the country. A Health Ministry official said Takeda first found out about the contaminated vials on Aug. 16 and reported the issue to the government on Wednesday. The delay was because Takeda needed time to gather information on which vials were affected and where they were in the country, the official said. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of Rovi's production lines. Rovi, whose shares slumped 13.38%, said in a statement it was investigating and ""working to provide all the information"" about the possible incident. It said the batch in question was meant for distribution only in Japan and two more batches processed before and after it were held back out of caution. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was investigating the contamination incident and was assessing whether there was an impact on EU supplies. ""EMA is investigating the matter and has requested the marketing authorisation holder to provide information on any potential impact on batches supplied to the EU in addition to details on the ongoing root cause investigation,"" the agency said in a statement to Reuters.

Japanese carrier ANA (9202.T) said about 4,700 shots of the halted Moderna lot had been used and it would stop all vaccinations planned on Thursday. Its rival Japan Airlines (9201.T) also cancelled some COVID-19 vaccinations for its employees on Thursday after receiving Moderna vaccines with particulate matter. Despite several companies cancelling planned vaccinations, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the country's inoculation plan would be little affected by the issue.

Greek health workers protest against introduction of mandatory COVID jabs,1700,"ATHENS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Greek frontline health workers protested on Thursday against a plan to make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for the care sector as infection rates remained high. Healthcare workers observed a four-hour work stoppage against new rules obliging medical staff to vaccinate against the coronavirus, and to call for more resources to public health. The mandatory jab comes into effect for healthcare workers on Sept. 1. Those who do not comply and have not had at least one shot of a vaccine will be suspended from their jobs. According to the POEDIN labour union, about 10 percent of healthcare workers have not had a first vaccine jab. Protesters said that while the call for vaccination was widely acknowledged and complied with by healthcare workers, the view of a dissenting few should to be respected.

Soothing Zoom filter will suit Powell speech,3428,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A calming prairie landscape would be a good Zoom backdrop for Jerome Powell’s virtual speech on Friday. The annual Federal Reserve confab, once again forced online from its traditional Jackson Hole, Wyoming, location, is usually a place to make news, as the U.S. central bank chair did in 2020. Now amid a Covid-19 resurgence, it's an occasion to avoid surprises. Powell made a big splash at the Kansas City Fed-sponsored conference last year. He announced that the Fed had adopted “average inflation targeting,” meaning it will allow prices to run moderately above its 2% goal for some time. So even if the unemployment rate falls, the central bank may not raise interest rates as long as inflation remains controlled, a policy that Powell acknowledged may be counterintuitive. This year, Powell has to pull off a balancing act. The Fed has been buying $120 billion of bonds each month to support the U.S. economy through the pandemic. This year's burgeoning recovery has pushed inflation higher than expected, in part because of comparisons to a period last year when the economy was shut down and because of supply-chain hiccups that have forced up prices for certain products like used cars. The consumer price index rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier. The minutes of the Fed’s rate-setting committee meeting in July showed that most participants thought asset purchases could be reduced starting this year. Investors want to know when and how so-called tapering will begin, and how it might transition into interest-rate increases. When the Fed wound down the stimulus program that ended in 2014, it shrank its purchases over 10 months and waited more than a year before raising rates. Then-Chair Ben Bernanke rocked markets before that process began in 2013 by saying the Fed would reduce its bond buying earlier than expected. Powell won't want to trigger any similar ""taper tantrum."" Meanwhile the delta variant of the coronavirus has started to damp economic activity again, with recent retail sales and consumer sentiment weakening. As an added challenge for Powell, he is also auditioning for a possible nomination for a second term as Fed chair if President Joe Biden's administration likes what it hears. Reassuring investors on tapering and rates while giving the central bank needed wiggle room will be a test of his skills. Follow @GinaChon on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Aug. 27 at the annual economic policy conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The theme of the event this year is “Macroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy.” On Aug. 20, the Kansas City Fed announced that the planned in-person conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, would instead be held virtually because of Covid-19 health risks.

Africa's COVID-19 third wave stabilises as vaccine levels rise - WHO,1151,"KINSHASA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A third wave of COVID-19 infections in Africa has stabilised and the continent's slow vaccination drive has picked up pace, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday. Some 248,000 new cases were reported in the past week, down from 282,000 in mid-July, while the number of vaccinations tripled to 13 million, Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director, told an online news conference. Africa, with a population of 1.3 billion, has experienced a third wave of infections since May, straining health systems in countries from South Africa to Tunisia, Zambia and Senegal, where vaccination rates are far lower than in Europe and North America. COVAX - the donor scheme co-led by the WHO to purchase vaccines for poorer countries - initially hoped to vaccinate 20% of people in Africa this year, but it has been plagued by delays. The WHO now hopes to vaccinate 10% of people in Africa by the end of September, Moeti said. ""117 million doses are due to arrive in the coming month and up to 34 million additional doses will be needed to reach that target,"" she said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Serbia closes largest unmanaged landfill in Europe -report,1820,"BELGRADE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Serbia closed its huge Vinca landfill, almost three weeks after acrid smoke engulfed the capital Belgrade following a fire at the site, the Tanjug news agency reported on Thursday, citing Irena Vujovic, country's minister for environmental protection. The four-decade old Vinca site is the largest unmanaged landfill site in Europe, according to the International Finance Corporation, and is located around 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) from downtown Belgrade near the Danube river. Its daily intake is more than 1,500 tonnes of household waste and around 3,000 tonnes of construction waste. Due to decomposition and poor waste treatment, fires emitting dense smoke from the site are frequent. read more According to the report, Vujovic said that the now-closed landfill would be stabilised from sliding and recultivated by 2023. ""We had a fire, ... due to 40 years of depositing of waste in a manner not prescribed (by regulations) ... I am hoping it will never happen again,"" the Tanjug quoted Vujovic as saying. According to data from Belgrade's health authorities, the Vinca landfill has so far released over 4 billion cubic meters of methane into the atmosphere. In recent years, Serbia's environmental organisations have staged protests to demand closure of the landfill. Belgrade authorities and the French-Japanese consortium Suez-Itochu in 2019 began construction of a new landfill site, incinerator and a waste-to-energy plant. Serbia is a candidate for membership of European Union, but before it can join, it needs to invest more than 15 billion euros to comply with the bloc's environmental standards, including those concerning solid and liquid waste treatment.

mRNA vaccines trigger backup immune response; some cancer drugs may help,3292,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Here is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Antibodies wane but other immune defenses remain alert A new study may help explain why mRNA vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are more effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths than they are at preventing infection. Test-tube experiments on blood samples from 61 fully vaccinated adults showed that by six months, vaccine-induced antibodies that can immediately neutralize the virus had declined. But so-called memory B cells, which produce new antibodies if they encounter the virus later on, had increased and become better at recognizing viral variants, according to a report posted on Monday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. ""Your immune system has a backup,"" said study leader John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. B-cell production of antibodies might take a few days to get underway, but then these memory B cells ""kick into action and prevent severe disease,"" Wherry added. Early data favors certain cancer treatments during pandemic Certain cancer drugs may help protect patients with malignancies from being infected with the new coronavirus, preliminary data suggests. The drugs, known as mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and antimetabolites, target the parts of cells that the virus uses to enter and make copies of itself, including a ""gateway"" protein on cell surfaces called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The study of 1,701 cancer patients found that after taking underlying risk factors into account, patients treated with mTOR/PI3K inhibitors or ACE2-lowering antimetabolites were 47% less likely to test positive for the virus than patients who received other drug therapies. Gemzar (gemcitabine) from Eli Lilly appeared to be particularly promising, according to the report in JAMA Oncology on Thursday. The study does not prove that the drugs lowered infection rates, however, and much more research is needed to confirm their potential for protecting cancer patients from the coronavirus. One in four infected LA residents had been vaccinated From May through July 2021, as the Delta variant spread, 43,127 residents of Los Angeles County in California were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections. One in four had been fully vaccinated, though these patients had lower rates of hospitalization (3.2% versus 7.6%), intensive care (0.5% versus 1.5%) and need for machines to help with breathing (0.2% versus 0.5%) than unvaccinated patients, public health officials reported on Tuesday in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. During the study period, the prevalence of the Delta variant rose from less than 9% to at least 87%, the authors note. As of July 25, hospitalization rates were 29 times higher for unvaccinated patients, they estimated, ""indicating that COVID-19 vaccination protects against severe COVID-19 in areas with increasing prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.""

EU says COVID boosters may have higher legal risks without EMA approval,3244,"BRUSSELS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - European Union countries that decide to use COVID-19 vaccine booster shots may face increased legal risks because the additional dose has not yet been recommended by the EU drugs regulator, the European Commission said on Thursday. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has repeatedly said that more data is needed before it can approve the use of boosters, but eight European countries have decided to recommend the additional dose, and more than a dozen are set to make similar moves shortly. ""Booster doses are currently not part of the marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines and have not yet been subject to a scientific assessment by EMA in the absence of sufficient data,"" the EU Commission said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday. ""The responsibility to decide to include boosters in their vaccination campaign remains with the Member States,"" the statement said, adding: ""As long as the booster doses are not part of the marketing authorisation, companies' liability is modified."" This could mean that in the event of unexpected side effects that can be linked to boosters, EU states might bear the brunt of any legal consequences and compensation demands. The Commission said however that companies' liability would not disappear entirely if boosters are administered without the EMA's approval. For instance, if a side effect after a booster is caused by manufacturing issues, the vaccine maker would remain liable for it. EU liability and indemnity rules apply in cases of unexpected adverse effects linked to the general characteristics of the product or its manufacturing. Each company supplying COVID-19 vaccines to the EU has negotiated different clauses, which remain largely confidential. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovenia are currently recommending the use of boosters, with Germany planning to do the same in the autumn. Thirteen other European states are discussing the matter. In recent months, the EU has reserved billions of doses from several COVID-19 vaccine makers for the coming years, saying they may be needed for boosters or to fight new variants. They could also be donated to poorer nations. COVID-19 booster shots will be made widely available to Americans from Sept. 20, U.S. health officials said last week, citing data showing diminishing protection from the initial vaccinations as infections rise from the Delta variant read more . Possible compensation for unexpected side effects from COVID-19 vaccines is managed at national level. Some EU countries, including the largest ones, have compensation schemes that are meant to indemnify potential victims outside courts, but criteria for reimbursements vary greatly. In others, alleged victims would need to go directly to courts to settle their case. Since the beginning of the vaccination campaign in Europe, hundreds of claims have been submitted to authorities by potential victims, official data from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Switzerland show, with only a handful of compensation awards so far granted, for undisclosed amounts of money.

VP Harris says U.S. will 'speak up' on South China Sea,4345,"HANOI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The United States welcomes competition and does not seek conflict with Beijing, but will speak up on issues like maritime disputes in the South China Sea, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday as she concluded a trip to Southeast Asia. In visits to Singapore and Vietnam, Harris charged China with bullying its neighbors in the region, triggering sharp rebukes from Beijing, which accused the U.S. of meddling in regional affairs and disrupting peace. read more ""We welcome stiff competition, we do not seek conflict, but on issues such as the South China Sea, we are going to speak up,"" Harris told a news conference in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. ""We are going to speak up when there are actions that Beijing takes that threaten the rules-based international order,"" she added. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to take on China globally. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contains gas fields and rich fishing grounds. In meetings with Vietnamese leaders on Wednesday, Harris said China's ""bullying and excessive maritime claims"" in the waters should be challenged, and offered U.S. support to enhance Vietnam's maritime security, including more visits by U.S. warships to the country. read more Her statements drew condemnation from Chinese state media. On Wednesday, the state run China Daily, responding to Harris' comments in Singapore, said Harris had ""willfully ignored her own hypocrisy"" in attempting to rally countries in the region against China. On Thursday, after her meetings in Hanoi, the Global Times said the U.S. was ""dreaming"" to incite Vietnam to confront China. ""For Washington, it couldn't be better if a new war between Beijing and Hanoi breaks out,"" the tabloid, published by the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial.

Harris' delayed arrival was later attributed by the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi to a mystery health incident potentially related to the mysterious ""Havana Syndrome,"" a condition of unknown origin that has sickened at least 200 U.S. officials, including CIA officers, with symptoms including nausea, migraines and memory lapses. ""I will tell you we're looking into it and I'm not able to share much more at this time,"" Harris said of the incident in Thursday's news conference. GEOPOLITICAL TEST The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century as it tries to rebuild its relationships in the region with a series of high-profile visits. Over the last few years, tensions between China and Vietnam in the South China Sea have remained high, although Hanoi has attempted to strike a delicate balancing act. Hanoi and Beijing's ruling Communist parties maintain close ties, and Vietnam is dependent on imported Chinese materials to support its manufacturing and exports. Meanwhile, ties with old foe the United States have grown increasingly close, although Washington has said there are limits to the relationship until Vietnam makes progress on human rights, an issue Harris said she raised with the country'sleaders.

Pentagon makes Pfizer vaccine mandatory after FDA approval- memo,1506,"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered all active-duty service members to be vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine days after the Food and Drug Administration granted it full approval. In a memo seen by Reuters, the Pentagon ordered the military to start the process immediately but did not put a specific timeline on when it should be completed. Earlier in the week it had said that such a move would be coming. The U.S. military has said that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members. Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19. The Pfizer shot became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be fully approved by the FDA. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thailand in talks to buy COVID-19 vaccines from European nations,1730,"BANGKOK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Thailand is in talks with European countries to purchase millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, a health official said on Thursday, as the Southeast Asian nation tries to speed up its inoculation rollout to contain a wave of infections. Authorities in Thailand have been scrambling to shore up vaccine supplies, despite the country being the production hub for AstraZeneca shots in the region. Last week, the government said it would borrow 150,000 AstraZeneca doses from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. read more ""Some countries may have a surplus of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) or Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccines and will be able to sell two to three million doses each month,"" senior health official Kiattiphum Wongrajit told a briefing. Kiattiphum did not specify any European countries involved in the talks. So far, about 9% of Thailand's population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated as it deals with its deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus. The majority of the country’s 1.1 million infections and 10,314 fatalities came after April this year due to the highly-transmissible Alpha and Delta variants, though infection rates have shown signs of easing. ""New cases have peaked and new infections will gradually decrease,"" Kiattiphum said. On Monday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said AstraZeneca would deliver 61 million doses that were previously delayed by the end of this year. read more Thailand's coronavirus taskforce will decide on Friday whether to relax lockdown measures, including a proposal to shorten a nighttime curfew and allow dining in at restaurants for those who are vaccinated or have been recently tested, he said.

Kerala's COVID-19 lessons for India and Modi's government,6396,"MALAPPURAM, India, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Vilified by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party for its high COVID-19 cases, Kerala's apparent poor record may actually hold crucial lessons for the country in containing the outbreak as authorities brace for a possible third wave of infections. The opposition-ruled, densely populated southern state is currently reporting the most number of coronavirus cases in the country and accounts for the second-highest national tally - unflattering headline numbers that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has seized upon as a reflection of bungled local leadership. However, a Reuters analysis of national and state data, and interviews with epidemiologists and Kerala health authorities paint a different picture. It shows the state's containment measures have helped to catch infections early, allowing authorities to better manage the illness and dramatically lower the death rate - a stark contrast to people dying in carparks and outside hospitals for lack of oxygen and beds in big cities like Delhi at the height of the health crisis a few months earlier. ""While the federal government may have its views on rapid antigen tests, it is important to consider that the state's strategies have by and large succeeded in not just keeping mortality low but also in being able to detect one in six cases compared to one in 33 nationally,"" said Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. The efficient detection rate and its population density at more than twice the national average explain the high number of cases in Kerala. All the same, at 0.5%, Kerala still has the lowest fatality rate among all but one thinly populated state. The national figure is 1.4% and it is 1.3% for the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The difference comes down to Kerala's reliance on rapid antigen tests to detect and strictly isolate infected people at home, an approach the federal health ministry has sharply criticised but which state officials argue has helped them to better allocate hospital beds and oxygen supplies for those who really need them. The government-recommended RT-PCR tests are more accurate but take longer to produce results, meaning by the time a positive COVID-19 case is confirmed the infected person is more likely to have developed severe symptoms and passed it on to others in a vicious cycle of more infections and deaths. Kerala's rapid test results allow for early treatment in home isolation which then narrows the virus' path to infections, state officials say. These factors, along with the strained medical resources across much of India, largely explain why the overall national death rate is much higher than in the Communist-run state. Kerala officials also say a state-run support service that includes phone consultation, provision of drugs and pulse oximeters that detect blood oxygen levels for people recovering at home provide a bulwark in the battle against the disease. Delhi had a similar support structure but it collapsed when cases surged. ""We do have a different model and our fatality rate shows our model is on the right track,"" Kerala Health Minister Veena George told Reuters. But Kerala officials acknowledge that the fast-evolving pandemic can undo even the best thought-out plans unless authorities remain nimble and flexible. A MODEL TO EMULATE? When Reuters recently visited Kerala's most populous Malappuram district, which is reporting the greatest number of infections in India, a quarter of the 344 COVID beds in its biggest hospital were vacant and oxygen supply was ample. The Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended lockdowns for districts where more than 10% of the tests return positive results. The rate is about 15% for Kerala and even higher in Malappuram, but shops and restaurants are open for business. Kerala officials argue that they are able to keep businesses open as the state has the best testing rate among Indian states - 86 tests per 100 people, compared with about 33 in Uttar Pradesh - meaning they are able to catch infections early and ensure timely treatment. The model, epidemiologists say, can be replicated in few other states with good health facilities, such as neighbouring Tamil Nadu. ""Their surveillance is good, they detect cases early and their testing is very focused,"" M.D. Gupte, a retired director of the National Institute of Epidemiology who advises the federal government on immunisations, said about Kerala. ""Most people in Kerala are educated, so that helps."" India’s daily demand for medical oxygen jumped more than eight times in May from pre-pandemic levels, but Kerala avoided major shortages of hospital beds and oxygen that crippled many states when nationwide infections saw an explosive surge. The federal health ministry did not respond to emails requesting comment. VACCINE PUSH Minister George said the state was on course to administer at least one vaccine dose to all adults by next month, the fastest pace among all states. Currently, the state has covered more than 55% of adults with at least one vaccine dose, compared with 48% for the whole of India, which wants to vaccinate all its adults by December. Kerala, with 35.5 million people, has so far reported 3.8 million infections, or 12% of India's total of 32.5 million. Its 19,757 deaths, however, account for only 4% of the overall nationwide fatalities. The Indian government recommends 70% of all COVID-19 tests be carried out by the RT-PCR method, while Kerala's rate is less than 50%. ""This is not the Kerala model, this is a model of mismanagement,"" BJP President Jagat Prakash Nadda, India's former health minister, said last week. He said BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had better managed the pandemic, though a government survey estimated in July that more than 70% residents of both states had been exposed to the virus. The figure was 44% for Kerala. Kerala's COVID-19 hospitalisation rate is only about 3%, a state official said, compared with more than 5% nationwide when cases peaked in May. T.S. Anish, a member of Kerala's COVID Expert Committee, said the state was now focused on vaccination. ""If you are able to vaccinate large numbers, you will get infections but your health system will not be overwhelmed."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"New York governor reveals 12,000 more COVID-19 deaths than previously counted",2860,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - New York Governor Kathy Hochul revealed 12,000 more people died of COVID-19 than was reported under her disgraced predecessor, making good on her promise for greater transparency on just her second day leading the state. The state is now reporting a total of 55,400 people died in New York from coronavirus, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hochul said in a statement. That's an increase of 12,000 over the 43,400 reported by Andrew Cuomo as of his last day in office before resigning in disgrace amid a sexual harassment scandal. ""We're using CDC numbers, which will be consistent. And so there's no opportunity for us to mask those numbers,"" Hochul told National Public Radio on Wednesday. Even with the additional 12,000 deaths, it does not change how New York state ranks nationally. New York still has the third highest total number of COVID deaths in the country, behind California and Texas. And New York still ranks second for deaths per capita, behind New Jersey, according to a Reuters tally. Hochul is a Democrat who assumed the top job on Tuesday after serving as Cuomo's lieutenant governor. New York City Fire Department (FDNY) Ambulances are parked at the emergency entrance of St. John's Episcopal Hospital, during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in the Far Rockaway section of Queens in New York City, U.S., May 20, 2020. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The number reported by Cuomo was incomplete because it focused only on confirmed COVID-19 deaths and it excluded those who died at their own homes and other places. The revised count is based on death certificate data submitted to the CDC, which includes any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 deaths in any location in New York, Hochul said in the statement. ""These are presumed and confirmed deaths. People should know both,"" Hochul told NPR. The revelation came on Hochul's second day on the job as governor, the first woman to hold New York's top office. After being sworn in on Tuesday, Hochul made a point of promising the public greater transparency to ensure that New Yorkers ""believe in their government again."" read more Immediately shining a spotlight on the numbers the Cuomo administration chose to report, Hochul became only the latest official to raise questions about whether he was massaging data to improve his image during the pandemic that once gripped New York as the U.S. epicenter.

Dust at BHP's iron ore mines poses health hazard-union,2078,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - High levels of dust at two of BHP Group's (BHP.AX) iron ore mines in Western Australia are impairing the health of workers and nearby residents, a union said this week, as BHP said it had undertaken a raft of measures to limit dust in the arid region. The state's environmental regulator this month began a review into elevated levels of airborne dust at BHP's Whaleback and Newman mines in the Pilbara, as part of a review into BHP's licence conditions and public submissions closed this week. The review will be undertaken over the second half of this year and could result in changes to BHP's license conditions. The mines are some 1,065 kilometres (662 miles) north east of Perth. A survey of current or former residents and mine workers who spent a significant amount of time in the community found 80% said the dust had affected their lives, according to a submission by the Western Mine Workers Alliance. Of those, 82% said they had experienced adverse health affects, while others said they had suffered property damage and impacts to their lifestyle due to dust. “All industry has some impact on the local environment,” said Brad Gandy, state branch secretary of the Australian Workers Union, which is part of the alliance. “The problem is how this impact is managed, and it is clear that dust emissions are at levels that seriously affect the health, wellbeing and lifestyles of the Newman community.” BHP said in a statement that it prioritises the health and safety of its employees and host communities, and was committed to managing our dust levels in Newman. ""Air quality is complex and the majority of elevated dust events in Newman occur in conjunction with certain weather conditions,"" it said. Dust control measures across the sites include using dust suppress sprays, water trucks and revegetation programs. It is spending $230 million over the next five years to further improve air quality and implement dust mitigation work to keep dust levels as low as possible, it said.

Japan's Suga faces challengers in ruling party leadership race,4020,"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Japanese former foreign minister Fumio Kishida challenged Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Thursday for the leadership of the ruling party, as the premier struggles with crumbling approval rates ahead of a general election. Suga repeated he would seek re-election in the Sept. 29 race for Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president, while ex-internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi also threw her hat in the ring. The winner is virtually assured of being prime minister because of the LDP's majority in parliament's lower house. The LDP chief must lead the party to a general election by Nov. 28, which the Sankei newspaper said will be held in October or later. L1N2PX0E0 ""The people feel that their voices are not reaching the LDP,"" Kishida, 64, told a news conference. ""I am running ... to show that the LDP listens to the people and is a party that offers broad choices, and to protect our nation's democracy,"" said Kishida, adding he would aim for a more equitable, diverse society. The challenges to Suga may not topple him as leader, said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. ""My sense is, most people in markets expect Suga to win unless he decides to quit by himself."" The LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its majority in the powerful lower house, but forecasts suggest that Suga's party could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever is leading the LDP. Suga, 72, took office last September with support of about 70% but his ratings have sunk below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections and many of his LDP lawmakers fear for their seats. LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, who was key to Suga's victory last year, said on Wednesday he still backs the prime minister. The party's smallest faction, led by former cabinet minister Nobuteru Ishihara, was also lining up behind Suga, Jiji news agency reported. Other party bosses, including former premier Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso, have not commented publicly. KISHIDA LOW-KEY, LOW-POPULARITY Unlike last year, grass-roots LDP members will vote along with the party's members of parliament, which could make the outcome harder to predict. And novice MPs, fearful of losing their seats, may be wary of following their elders' orders. Kishida, a soft-spoken lawmaker from Hiroshima, had been seen as the preferred heir to Abe, who stepped down last year as prime minister citing ill health. But Kishida lost the ensuing party poll after factions coalesced around Suga, who had been Abe's right-hand man for eight years. Kishida said he'd aim to reduce income gaps and support the economically vulnerable such as workers in insecure jobs and women, an apparent effort to differentiate his stance from Suga, who has stressed self-reliance before public support. He called for an economic stimulus package as soon as possible, but did not specify its size. The low-key Kishida has ranked low in surveys of voters' preferred next prime minister, well below other possible rivals such as Administrative Reform Minister Taro Kono, who is leading Japan's vaccination rollout, and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba. ""Unless they chose someone like Ishiba who is more popular with the public, it will be hard to recover lost support,"" said Hiroyoshi Sunakawa, a professor at Tokyo's Rikkyo University. Takaichi, a conservative Abe disciple seen as a long-shot to become Japan's first female premier, told reporters she wanted to finish what Abe had left undone, including hitting a 2% inflation target that has eluded policy makers. Suga had hoped to call the general election in September after hosting the Olympics, but a spike in COVID-19 cases upended that scenario. Suga's pandemic response suffered another setback after Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) said it has withheld 1.63 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan after a report of contamination. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
AstraZeneca drug for rare disease shows promise in flushing copper build-up,1401,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) said on Thursday a late-stage trial showed its medicine for a rare disease that causes accumulation of copper in the body was three times more successful in helping remove deposits from tissues compared with standard care. The treatment, developed by the drugmaker's recently acquired Alexion rare diseases unit, was being tested for Wilson disease, a genetic condition in which the body's ability to remove excess copper is compromised. The experimental oral medicine taken once-daily could provide a less invasive option for patients who are typically given treatments which involve injecting a metal removing solution into the blood or zinc therapy. ""As we advance this first innovation in Wilson disease treatment in more than 30 years, we will continue to follow these patients long term to further assess clinical impact on disease symptoms,"" Alexion Chief Executive Officer Marc Dunoyer said. Copper build-up can cause liver disease and psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such as personality changes, tremors and difficulty in walking, swallowing or talking. The study met the main goal of improvement in the daily mean copper mobilised from tissues over a period of 48 weeks. The treatment has been given an ""Orphan Drug"" status in the United States and European Union to help speed up development. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
African football urges UK to give footballers travel exemption,2507,"CAIRO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The Confederation of African Football has appealed to the British government to grant exemptions to African footballers who are hoping to return to their home countries next week to compete in World Cup qualifiers. The call follows the collective decision by the clubs of Premier League to refuse to release players headed to countries on the United Kingdom’s COVID-19 ‘red list’ because of the quarantine measures they would face on their return from international duty. “CAF, on behalf of all African member associations, African players and fans, has urged the British Government to urgently provide the required exemptions to enable African players to compete for their countries in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers,” said a statement. “CAF notes that similar exemptions were granted by the British Government to enable the attendance of delegations and officials, among others, at the finals of the European Championship held less than two months ago. “It is further noted that the circumstances in the African countries on the red list in many cases are in fact less severe than other countries not currently on this list or for which exemptions were previously provided.” There are 25 African countries on the ‘red list’, which is expected to be updated on Thursday. CAF said all next month’s World Cup qualifiers in Africa, which will be played from Wednesday Sept. 1 through to Tuesday Sept. 7, would be under strict health conditions. “The upcoming matches will be delivered under the strict protocols developed by FIFA and applied across the world, as was the case in previous windows and continental tournaments successfully delivered without any incidents. “These protocols have now proven beyond a doubt that they mitigate the risks involved, reflecting the success of commensurate protocols applied domestically in England and other parts of the world. “In light of the above, CAF has appealed as a matter of urgency, to the Football Association (FA) and the British Government that the same treatment previously applied to Europe now be extended to Africa under the principles of solidarity and equal treatment,” the statement added. It followed a similar appeal for solidarity on Wednesday from FIFA president Gianni Infantino, whose organisation had previously allowed clubs to refuse call-ups to players who face quarantine on return for international assignments but cancelled that temporary ruling in June.

"Players in 'bubble' before Australian Open, not quarantine",2584,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australian Open organisers are planning for players to have two weeks in a biosecure bubble before next year's Grand Slam rather than be subject to the country's strict hotel quarantine regime, tournament boss Craig Tiley said on Thursday. Players, coaches and officials had to spend 14 days in hotel quarantine after arriving in Australia for the tournament in February due to COVID-19 restrictions, though most were permitted up to five hours a day to train at closed courts. ""There's a lot of time between now and when we get going, but at this point in time we're planning on having a two-week bubble, where the players will be able to move freely between the hotel and the courts,"" Tiley said at a Nine Network event. ""They’re protected, they’re kept safe among themselves and safe from the community as well. ""And after those two weeks, they’ll come out and be able to compete in the Australian Open in front of crowds. ""We’re working with the government and health authorities now on the amount of crowds and what the Australian Open will specifically look like."" The year's first Grand Slam is held at Melbourne Park. About 70 Australian Open players were unable to leave their hotel rooms for their entire isolation last January after being deemed close contacts of positive cases on flights into Australia. Some complained bitterly about the conditions, triggering a backlash from Melbourne residents who were subject to one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly four months in 2020. Only one player, Spain's Paula Badosa, tested positive for the coronavirus. Tiley said last month players would not be prepared to go through the same quarantine conditions again. read more Last year's tournament was pushed back to February because organisers were unable to secure government approval in time.

Death toll rises to at least 20 in western Venezuela floods,2667,"SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, Aug 25 (Reuters) - At least 20 people have died in the western Venezuelan state of Merida following intense rains that caused mudslides and rivers to overflow. On state TV on Wednesday a ruling Socialist Party official in Merida announced the death doll had risen and said authorities were working to restore telephone service in some areas. State governor Ramon Guevara said earlier that more than 1,200 houses had been destroyed and 17 people remained missing as rescue workers search the wreckage. ""Let's try not to make this political or ideological,"" Guevara, a member of the Democratic Action opposition party, said. ""Lets all look for solutions to the problem."" Images shared on social media showed cars being swept down streets, buildings and businesses filled with mud, and mudslides that left boulders strewn across roads. Several towns in the affected area including Tovar, Bailadores, Zea and Santa Cruz de Mora are without electricity as floodwaters damaged transformers, Guevara said. Neither the state nor municipal governments have the resources to help the affected areas, he said, but he had charged infrastructure specialists to work with Caracas on repairing buildings and roads.

China criticises U.S. 'scapegoating' over COVID origin report,3662,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday criticized the U.S. ""politicization"" of efforts to trace the origin of the coronavirus, demanding without any evidence that American labs be investigated, ahead of the release of a U.S. intelligence report on the virus. The U.S. report is intended to resolve disputes among intelligence agencies considering different theories about how the coronavirus emerged, including a once-dismissed theory about a Chinese laboratory accident. ""Scapegoating China cannot whitewash the U.S.,"" Fu Cong, director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' arms control department, told a briefing. U.S. President Joe Biden received a copy and was briefed on the classified report on Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. The intelligence community has been ""working expeditiously"" to prepare an unclassified version for the public, Psaki said without giving a timeline for its release. U.S. officials say they do not expect the review to lead to firm conclusions after China stymied earlier international efforts to gather key information on the ground. read more China has said a laboratory leak was highly unlikely, and it has ridiculed a theory that coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 infections emerged in late 2019, setting off the pandemic. Beijing has instead suggested that the virus slipped out of a lab at the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick base in Maryland in 2019. ""It is only fair that if the U.S. insists that this is a valid hypothesis, they should do their turn and invite the investigation into their labs,"" Fu said.

The fringe idea once put forward by individual Chinese officials - which lacks any public evidence - has become a Chinese government talking point as it attempts to deflect criticism about its possible role in the origins of the virus. On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Washington posted the calls for World Health Organization investigations at Fort Detrick and at the University of North Carolina to its website after it said U.S. media had rejected its editorial submissions. And on Tuesday, China's envoy to the United Nations asked the head of the WHO for an investigation into U.S. labs. A joint WHO-Chinese team visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology but the United States said it had concerns about the access granted to the investigation. ""The early days of the pandemic were irrefutably in China, yet China continues to obfuscate and deny the international community the needed access,"" a senior U.S. administration official said, adding that if a future pandemic were to originate in the United States, it would insist on a ""swift and transparent"" evaluation. ""If there were sound, technically credible reasons for a U.S. investigation, we would of course support it. But there are none,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

"Vietnam expects 50,000 new virus cases in major manufacturing hub",2110,"HANOI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam will deploy troops to industrial Binh Duong province, a major manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian country, to help contain an expected 50,000 additional coronavirus infections there over the next two weeks, the government said on Thursday. Binh Duong is adjacent to virus epicentre Ho Chi Minh City and has so far recorded 81,000 COVID-19 cases, a third of which were detected in the past week, according to Vietnam's health ministry. The province is home to production facilities for dozens of major firms, including South Korea's Kumho Tire (073240.KS) and Tetra Pak, the world's largest food packaging company. The province also hosts a string of suppliers for Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Pegatron (4938.TW), a key supplier for Apple. It is one of Vietnam's largest recipients of foreign investment after Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Provincial authorities are preparing for a worst-case scenario within which cases could exceed 150,000, the government said in a statement on its website. The number refers to a contingency plan, and is not a projection. 2,000 troops will be sent to the province to support the fight against the virus, the government statement said, along with 50 mobile medical stations and 15 ambulances. Vietnam has deployed soldiers to the streets of Ho Chi Minh City to help enforce the country's strictest movement curbs yet which prevent people from leaving home, even for food. Ordinary residents who need to travel in the event of a medical emergency can still do so, but the military has taken over the distribution of food in most parts of the city. After successfully containing the pandemic for much of last year, Vietnam has been battling a surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. The country has recorded a total of 381,000 cases, most of which were detected in Ho Chi Minh City and its surrounding provinces since late April.

Australian environmental group sues Santos over clean energy claims,2256,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - An Australian environmental group is suing the country's No.2 independent gas producer Santos Ltd (STO.AX), alleging the company's statements about gas being ""clean"" and having a clear pathway to net zero by 2040 were deceptive. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court on Thursday, and says it is the first case in the world to challenge the validity of a company's net zero emissions target. Companies around the world have set out ambitious targets to be carbon neutral within the next 20 to 30 years, under pressure from investors concerned about climate change. Santos has said it aims to get to net zero by 2040 with the help of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects - including plans to store carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gas fields - and with soil carbon projects such as tree planting. Santos declined to comment on the matter before the court, but its spokesperson said the company stands by its statements. CCS, which is mainly used today for enhanced oil recovery projects, is seen by green groups as untested and unnecessarily prolonging the life of the fossil fuel industry. ACCR said its case is a world-first test case around the viability of CCS and the environmental impacts of blue hydrogen, or hydrogen produced using gas, with the carbon dioxide emitted in the process captured and stored. ""Santos has perfected the art of greenwashing, and shareholders continue to be misled by Santos' clean energy claims,"" ACCR's director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said in a statement. ACCR is asking the court to declare that Santos has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, prohibit the company from doing so in the future, and require the company to correct statements about the environmental impact of its operations.

Afghanistan's banks brace for bedlam after Taliban takeover,5437,"LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's banks, critical to the country's recovery from crisis, are facing an uncertain future say its bankers, with doubts over everything from liquidity to employment of female staff after the Taliban swept to power. Banks were expected to reopen imminently, a Taliban spokesman said on Tuesday, after they were closed for some ten days and the financial system ground to a halt as the Western-backed government collapsed amid the pullout of U.S. and allied troops. Yet there has been scant evidence so far of a reopening or of banking services returning to normal, with large crowds thronging the streets outside banks in Kabul on Wednesday. ""The banks continue to be closed - with no clear signs of reopening, they have run out of money,"" said Gazal Gailani, trade and economic adviser at the Afghan embassy in London. ""Afghanistan's banking system is now in a state of collapse, and people are running out of money."" Many rural areas get by largely without banks. But in the cities, where government worker salaries are often paid into bank accounts, closures are causing hardship in a mostly cash-based economy. The outlook for lenders looks precarious, with looming questions about the Taliban's grasp of finance and its ability to restart an economy shattered by 40 years of war. With no significant exports apart from illegal narcotics bringing in cash, one immediate obstacle is liquidity in a country that is heavily dollarised and relies on regular physical dollar-shipments that have been halted, according to former central bank chief Ajmal Ahmady. The Afghanistan Banks Association (ABA) had reached out to the central bank to coordinate steps on a return to normality, said Syed Moosa Kaleem Al-Falahi, chief executive and president of Islamic Bank of Afghanistan (IBA), one of Afghanistan's three largest banks. Commercial banks had collectively decided to suspend services until the central bank confirmed liquidity and security arrangements, he said. ""It would be rather difficult to control the rush if banks reopen immediately,"" he added. Liquidity had already been an issue in the run-up to the bank closures as people scrambled to withdraw cash. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, provided financial support to banks during last week's cash squeeze, said a banker at one of Afghanistan's largest lenders, speaking on condition of anonymity. But its ability to continue to do so appears uncertain, with DAB's roughly $9 billion in foreign reserves looking largely out of Taliban reach. read more ""Banks will face major liquidity challenges as central bank officials have not had access to reserves yet,"" the banker said. ""They will face foreign currency liquidity issues which will cause huge fluctuations in the exchange rates."" SCARCE DOLLARS The afghani plunged on the expectation of dollar scarcity and further volatility is expected, with Afghanistan's import coverage reportedly collapsing from more than 15 months to a couple of days. Bankers in Afghanistan are also waiting for clarity from foreign-based correspondent banks, which provide services such as currency exchange and money transfers, on whether ties will continue after the Taliban takeover. Any new sanctions could see many links cut. A senior Afghan banker said their bank's correspondent banks in Turkey, Russia, Spain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Pakistan and India were still showing support. Faith in the banking system was severely damaged by the 2010 collapse of Kabul Bank, in one of the biggest corruption scandals of the 20-year Western presence in Afghanistan. Banks emerged in generally good health from the COVID-19 pandemic, said DAB in its 2020 report, noticing no liquidity shortfall, while capital positions met regulatory thresholds and assets swelled 4% to 327 billion afghanis ($3.8 billion). But the current crisis will further set back confidence in a sector which has struggled to expand services in a thinly banked country. According to the International Monetary Fund, only 183 of every 1,000 people hold a deposit account; there are less than two bank branches or cash machines for every 100,000 adults. FEMALE STAFF WORRIES This week, the Taliban said it had named Haji Mohammad Idris, a loyalist with no formal financial training, as DAB's acting governor. A senior Taliban leader defended the appointment, saying Idris was respected for his expertise. read more It is so far unclear whether Afghanistan's less than a dozen banks, all but one of which are conventional, will have to convert to Islamic banking, a lengthy and costly procedure. More uncertainty surrounds the future employment of female staff. ""So far there is no official communication from them (the Taliban) with respect to female staff,"" said IBA's Al-Falahi. ""Our female staff will return to work when we reopen."" But given the Taliban's track record, their assurances that women would be allowed to work consistent with Islamic law have been met with scepticism. The banker at one of Afghanistan's largest lenders said their bank had a plan to ensure it could continue operations in the event of it having to dismiss its roughly 20% of female staff. ""We expect we will face challenges such as losing qualified and high-skilled staff as most of them are planning to flee the country at the first opportunity,"" the banker said.

India's GDP growth likely touched a record in April-June - Reuters poll,2373,"BENGALURU, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Indian economic growth likely touched a record high in the quarter through June, reflecting a very weak base last year and a rebound in consumer spending, a Reuters poll found. The Aug. 20-25 Reuters poll of 41 economists showed gross domestic product rose 20.0% in the three-month period, compared with a record contraction of 24.4% in the same quarter a year earlier. Forecasts in the poll ranged from 10.5% to 31.6%, showing the considerable uncertainty around those base effects. The rebound came despite the drag from the deadly second wave of the coronavirus, which forced states across India to reimpose localised lockdowns and stop mobility completely from late April to early June. read more But unlike during the nationwide lockdown last year, repeat state-level lockdowns had a less pronounced impact on the economy as they left more room for consumers to spend. ""India's second COVID-19 wave acted as a stumbling block to the robust recovery that was underway. Still, the economic damage appears to be less than previously expected,"" said Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at Barclays. If the poll median is realised, it would be India's fastest growth since official quarterly data started being released in the mid-1990s. That's up sharply from 1.6% in the previous quarter, but a bit slower than the Reserve Bank of India's 21.4% projection. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began in April just as the economy was beginning to rally from a lull at the start of the year, throwing the recovery off course, although not as much as many feared. ""Humanitarian costs of the health crisis were high, but the economic impact was less severe than the first wave and activity rebounded faster,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank. A separate Reuters poll a month ago predicted India's GDP would expand 19.8% in the April-June quarter, little different to the latest median, and 9.4% for the current fiscal year. However, the spread of potential new virus variants poses a threat. ""The recovery remains uneven,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. ""The risks to watch out for are a third wave of COVID-19, a slower than expected pace of vaccinations, and lastly, new variants that may emerge which may not be very amenable to the vaccines which exist right now.""

Sydney hospitals erect emergency tents as COVID-19 cases hit record,3122,"SYDNEY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australia's new daily cases of COVID-19 topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first time since the global pandemic began, as two major hospitals in Sydney set up emergency outdoor tents to help deal with a rise in patients. Sydney, the country's largest city and the epicentre of the current outbreak, is struggling to stamp out a surge in the fast-spreading Delta variant, with daily infections hitting record levels even after two months under lockdown. New South Wales (NSW) state, where Sydney is the capital, reported 1,029 new locally acquired cases, exceeding the previous record of 919 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 969 were detected in greater Sydney, up from 838. The rapid rise in COVID-19 patients has forced Sydney's Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city's sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity. The makeshift unit in the emergency department for COVID-19 patients will help ""to offload delays"", a Western Sydney Local Health District spokesperson told Reuters. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities had quadrupled the number of the state's intensive care ventilators to 2,000 early last year. Although the system is ""under pressure"", it can withstand the current crisis once vaccination rates rise, she said. ""It might be different to the help you got before because of the situation, but please know the system is kicking in,"" Berejiklian said at a televised media conference. Of 116 people in intensive care in NSW, 102 are not vaccinated. Three new deaths were reported, including a man in his 30s who died at home, taking deaths from the latest outbreak to 79, although the death rate has slowed since last year. In a video posted on Twitter Wednesday night, the Australian Paramedic Association said paramedics were given a choice to wait in their vehicles with infected people or ""wait outside in the freezing rain"" due to the rise in patients. The fast-moving Delta strain has taken the gloss off Australia's early success against the virus that kept its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with some 47,700 cases and 989 deaths. About 32% of people above 16 have been fully vaccinated while just over 54% have had at least one dose. Besides Sydney, the country's second-largest city, Melbourne, and capital, Canberra, are also in hard lockdowns, putting more than half of the country's 25 million population under strict stay-at-home orders. Cases in Victoria, home to Melbourne, surged to 80 on Thursday, up from 45 a day earlier. The federal government is pushing ahead with the country's reopening plans once vaccination rates reach 70%-80%, but some states have hinted they may delay given the rapid growth of cases in Sydney. Berejiklian said NSW may reach 70% fully vaccinated by mid-October, and airline Qantas (QAN.AX) said it was preparing for international travel to resume in December. Also on Thursday, grocer Woolworths Group (WOW.AX) reported a surge in annual profit as lockdowns sparked demand for household essentials. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pfizer seeks U.S. approval for COVID vaccine booster,3059,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday said a booster dose of its two-shot COVID-19 vaccine spurs a more than threefold increase in antibodies against the coronavirus, as the company seeks U.S. regulatory approval for a third injection. The drugmaker and its German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) aim to complete the submission for use of booster shots in people aged 16 and over by the end of this week. The U.S. government has said it was gearing up to roll out the third shot of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) from mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decide that boosters are needed. That eight-month gap is likely to be narrowed to six months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. A committee of outside advisors to the CDC is scheduled to meet on Monday to review clinical data. Pfizer said 306 people given a third dose of its vaccine between five and eight months after their second shot showed levels of neutralizing antibodies that were 3.3 times the levels seen after their second shot. The study, details of which have not yet been published, also found that side effects of a third shot were similar to second-dose reactions, including mild to moderate fatigue and headache, the company said. Scientists continue to debate whether waning antibody levels mean that COVID vaccine boosters need to be given widely, but some countries are moving ahead. Israel began rolling out boosters at the beginning of August to older citizens and this week expanded the drive to people as young as 30, saying the shots were helping to increase protection against the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. U.S. President Joe Biden has said, ""It's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that may arise."" However, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the data on the benefits and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is inconclusive. The health agency called for a delay in rolling out booster shots and a goal of higher vaccination rates in countries where many had not received a first or second shot. On Monday, U.S. regulators granted full approval to Pfizer's two-dose vaccine, which has been available up until now under emergency use authorization. The approval spurred some local governments, such as New York City and the state of New Jersey, as well as the U.S. military and some companies, to mandate vaccines. A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not currently authorized for broad use in the United States. However, under the amended emergency use authorization, a third dose was authorized for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who were immunocompromised. Pfizer and BioNTech said they intend to file the data with the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities around the world in coming weeks.

"S.Korea reports highest daily COVID-19 deaths for 2021, as severe cases rise",1542,"SEOUL, Aug 26 (Reuters) - South Korea reported 20 COVID-19 deaths for Wednesday, the highest daily count this year, as the number of severe cases more than doubled since the current and worst wave of infections began in July. While total case mortality rates remain low at below 1% and no major strains on its healthcare system is reported yet, South Korean authorities have been trying to secure more ICU beds for severe patients which are on the rise along with record new infections. The number of critical or severe cases jumped to 425 as of Wednesday from 155 as of July 7, around when the fourth wave of infections began. The country has 833 intensive care beds for severe COVID-19 patients and 250 of them were available as of Tuesday, according to the health ministry. On Thursday it kicked off vaccination for people aged 18 to 49, as it aims to give at least one dose to 70% of the population and fully vaccinate 50% by September. South Korea has been struggling to boost its immunisation drive that began in February amid supply shortages and shipment delays, with about 52.7% of its 52 million people having received at least one dose, while just 26% are fully vaccinated. Of the eligible 15 million in the 18-49 age bracket, just below 70% had signed up for vaccination, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said. South Korea reported 1,882 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 243,317. A total of 2,257 people have died so far, the KDCA data showed. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Taiwan to get BioNTech shots early as China delays approval-source,3732,"TAIPEI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan could get its first delivery of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccines one month ahead of schedule as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island, a source told Reuters. Taiwan's tortured bid for the vaccine, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), has become an issue of high political and diplomatic drama, after Taiwan accused China of blocking a deal earlier this year, which Beijing denied. China claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed tech giants Foxconn (2317.TW), its billionaire founder Terry Gou, and TSMC (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the shot, with a $350 million deal for 10 million shots inked last month. read more More than 1 million doses, which had been originally destined for China, are expected to arrive in Taiwan between the end of August and early September, around one month earlier than initially planned, the person who has direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ""Shanghai Fosun did not manage to get approval so they gave up their plan for vaccine imports,"" the source said, referring to BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd (600196.SS). ""The original manufacturer was meant to make the delivery to Shanghai Fosun, but Fosun had to release them (the vaccines) as they didn't get the emergency use authorisation"" from China, the source added. Two other sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the supplies are due to arrive next week, but declined to say what led to the change of schedule. While BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said in April he expected its COVID-19 vaccine would win approval from the Chinese authorities ""by June at the latest"", no approval has been granted yet. It is approved in Hong Kong and Macau. It was not immediately clearly how many doses had been earmarked for delivery to China and to which other destinations the surplus would be re-directed as a result of the uncertain approval outlook. Taiwan will be among several places getting the orders ""abandoned"" by China, the first source said, who declined to name other recipients that include a European country. BioNTech and TSMC declined to comment. Fosun and China's National Health Commission did not respond to requests for comment. The made-in-Germany vaccines Taiwan will get will have labelling in the simplified Chinese characters used in China though not in Taiwan, along with the name of Shanghai Fosun, according to the first source. Responding to requests for comment for this article, Gou's spokesperson referred Reuters to Taiwan's health authorities. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters he could not say when the vaccines would arrive, as there were still some procedures that needed to be completed, and dismissed any concerns about the labelling. ""During this period of time, epidemic prevention is our only consideration. The important thing is whether the vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. The BioNTech vaccine drama has transfixed Taiwan and dominated headlines. While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control, fewer than 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated. Taiwan's government has ordered millions of vaccines itself, from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp (6547.TWO). Once the BioNTech vaccines arrive they will be donated to and administered by the government. A Taiwanese Buddhist group has also ordered 5 million doses.

"Kroger plans for 1 million Covid-19 booster shots a week, including in nursing homes",2928,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. grocery chain Kroger Co (KR.N) is gearing up to administer 1 million COVID-19 booster shots a week once they are available to the general public, and plans to offer vaccines in nursing homes for those who cannot go to its stores. The U.S. government is planning to make COVID-19 vaccine booster shots widely available from Sept. 20 to Americans if U.S. health regulators give the go-ahead. Only people who are immunocompromised have been eligible for booster shots since early this month. Retailers including Kroger, CVS Health(CVS.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance(WBA.O) and Walmart(WMT.N) are likely to play a role in administering the booster shots. Colleen Lindholz, president of Kroger Health, told Reuters in an interview that about 100 of its U.S. locations would have dedicated workers providing vaccinations all day long. Lindholz said the targeted 1 million shots a week would be twice the rate at which it had given first and second doses of the vaccine at the height of the pandemic. Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by revenue, also told Reuters it plans to provide shots in long-term care facilities. CVS and Walgreens gave most of the first and second doses of the vaccines in those facilities. ""When the vaccine first came out, we were not included in the long-term care facility deployment, but it's great this time that we can be a part of that,"" Lindholz said. ""We've reached out to facilities that we already deliver prescriptions to, or where we've done flu shot clinics in the past."" A U.S. health official said the government is planning for long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccine boosters through their usual pharmacy partners or new partners. CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in an early August interview that if boosters are approved, the company plans to be one of many pharmacies offering them in long-term care facilities. Kroger expects the bulk of the shots to be administered around the end of November through to January, coinciding with the holiday shopping season. ""We know how chaotic that will be with the holidays and so we're doing all we can to work with the CDC and Advisory Council on Immunization Practices to really influence kind of bumping that up - but obviously that's not our decision,"" Lindholz said. The CDC did not comment specifically on Kroger. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said that it has asked pharmacy partners to plan based on the idea that individuals would be eligible for boosters starting eight months after they received their second vaccine dose, subject to FDA authorization and a CDC committee recommendation on the interview. Scientists and public health officials have yet to agree that a third booster dose is needed and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said more first doses should be given around the world before wealthier nations start boosters.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Two lawyers and two surgeons have been indicted by a federal grand jury on mail- and wire-fraud charges for allegedly participating in a five-year, $31 million insurance scam in which “extremely poor” and often homeless or drug-addicted people in New York City were recruited to stage trip-and-fall accidents, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan and the FBI’s New York office jointly announced the unsealed indictment following the arrests of attorney Marc Elefant and Drs. Andrew Dowd and Sady Ribeiro. The fourth defendant, attorney George Constantine, is expected to surrender on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in the announcement. Elefant’s attorney, Michael Bachner of Bachner & Associates, said Elefant denies the charges and “acted in good faith and in reliance on the information provided to him.” Attorneys for Constantine and Ribeiro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dowd’s attorney, Aaron Mysliwiec of Edel & Mysliwiec, declined to comment. The unsealed indictment alleges that, between 2013 and 2018, conspiracy members would identify business locations with cracked sidewalks, potholes, or other tripping hazards and recruit needy individuals to stage accidents there. The individuals - referred to as “Patients” - were required to undergo surgery to maximize the value of their claims, and received post-surgical stipends of $1,000 or $1,500, prosecutors allege. The claims were then referred to attorneys, including Constantine and Elefant, to file and settle lawsuits against the businesses and insurers, the indictment says. Constantine negotiated settlements of at least $20 million, prosecutors allege. (No figure was specified for Elefant.) The “patients” often saw little to none of that money because their medical and legal expenses were fronted by litigation funders at high rates of interest, the indictment says. The rest of the case file remained under seal on Wednesday. The action has been assigned to Senior U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska. The case is U.S. v.

"Heart inflammation risk boosted slightly by vaccine, more by COVID-19 -study",2202,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The use of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) widely used COVID-19 vaccine marginally increases the risk of heart inflammation, but the risk is higher among those infected with the coronavirus, a study published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine showed. Among every 100,000 patients who get the vaccine, 1 to 5 will likely develop myocarditis who would not otherwise have developed it, researchers reported based on data from Clalit Health Services, a large Israeli HMO. That rate is much higher - 11 per 100,000 - among people infected with the coronavirus, they said. The data comes days after Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine became the first fully approved vaccine in the United States for people aged 16 and older, a move that could potentially persuade vaccine skeptics to get the shot. The researchers compared adverse event rates in 884,828 vaccinated individuals and an equal number of unvaccinated people. Overall, 21 persons reported myocarditis in the vaccinated group - mostly young men - compared with 6 people among the unvaccinated. Most adverse events in vaccinated people were mild, but some, such as myocarditis, are potentially serious, researchers said. The researchers also analyzed adverse event rates in more than 240,000 infected patients. The results indicate that COVID-19 infection is itself a very strong risk factor for myocarditis, and it also substantially increases the risk of other serious adverse events, they said. ""For me this is a really terrific paper in part because it actually takes data from the same system, and tries to provide more information, not just about the potential risks of vaccination, but also the potential benefits of vaccination,"" said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, whose editorial was published with the report. Pfizer's vaccine, along with a rival mRNA vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), came under regulatory scrutiny in several countries after some reports of cases of heart inflammation. Israel's health ministry said in June it saw a possible link between such cases and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

UK car output falls to lowest July level since 1950s,904,"LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - British car output fell to its lowest July level since 1956 as a global shortage of semi-conductor chips and staff having to self-isolate due to COVID-19 hit the sector, a trade industry body said on Thursday.

BOSTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the jury convictions of Insys Therapeutics Inc founder John Kapoor and four other company officials, over their roles in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe addictive opioids and defraud insurers into paying for them. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled 3-0 that ""unalloyed greed"" drove the defendants to market the fentanyl spray Subsys to ""pill mill"" doctors, who would then prescribe it to patients with no medical need. In a 138-page decision, Circuit Judge Bruce Selya wrote that Insys and Kapoor, who had been chief executive, deserved ""great credit"" for developing Subsys to treat cancer pain, but in the pursuit of profit ""turned what should have been a blessing into a curse."" Kapoor, 77, was convicted in 2019 and is serving a 5-1/2-year prison sentence. He remains the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive convicted for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic. His co-defendants Michael Gurry, Sunrise Lee, Joseph Rowan and Richard Simon were sentenced to terms of one to 2-3/4 years. A lower court judge had set aside some of the jury findings, but the appeals court restored the original verdicts. ""This decision is a decisive win that vindicates the jury's verdict and preserves a just outcome for the defendants and the victims,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell in Boston said in a statement. Kapoor's lawyer declined to comment. Lee's lawyer Peter Horstmann said ""there are no words to adequately express my displeasure with the court’s opinion."" Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors said Insys used sham ""speaker programs,"" ostensibly to educate the medical field, as a means to pay bribes and kickbacks to doctors who prescribed Subsys, often to non-cancer patients. Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers that were reluctant to pay for Subsys, prosecutors said. Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than morphine.

The deal, which Purdue says is worth more than $10 billion, has widespread support but is still opposed by nine U.S. states. Members of the Sackler family who own the company have said they will contribute about $4.5 billion in exchange for legal protections against opioid-related litigation. Drain stated at the conclusion of Wednesday's hearing that Purdue, the Sacklers and the opposing states should continue efforts to reach a deal before Friday. ""I would encourage you ... to continue that work,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. plans COVID-19 booster shots at six months instead of eight - WSJ,1811,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators could approve a third COVID-19 shot for adults beginning at least six months after full vaccination, instead of the previously announced eight-month gap, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Approval of boosters for three COVID-19 shots being administered in the United States — those manufactured by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) — is expected in mid-September, the report said, citing a person familiar with the plans. Pfizer and BioNTech have already started the application process for the approval of its booster shot in people 16 and older, saying it spurs a more than three-fold increase in antibodies against the coronavirus. read more Earlier this week, U.S. regulators granted full approval to Pfizer's two-dose vaccine. Moderna said on Wednesday it has completed the real-time review needed for a full approval for its jab in people 18 and above. read more White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in her daily briefing that any such development would be under the purview of the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC said the government's plan to administer booster shot depends on pending action from the Food and Drug Administration and recommendation to it from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The FDA,however, reiterated its joint statement from last week that said the government was gearing up to roll out the third shot from mid-September to Americans who had their initial course of two-dose vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer more than eight months ago. The rollout would start if the FDA and the CDC decide that boosters are needed, U.S. officials had said. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Man sentenced to 6 years in plot to kidnap Michigan governor,2855,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - A man who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a plot to kidnap Michigan's governor received a sentence of just over six years in prison on Wednesday, after he also agreed to testify against fellow extremists in the ""Wolverine Watchmen"" militia who have been accused in the conspiracy. Ty Garbin, 25, was the first to be convicted of scheming to abduct Gretchen Whitmer, the state's first-term Democratic governor, from her vacation home last summer. Since the FBI said it uncovered the conspiracy by members of a militia group, more than a dozen men have been charged in state or federal court. U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker in Grand Rapids handed down the sentence of 75 months Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors had sought a nine-year prison sentence for Garbin, who cooperated with the government. At the hearing, Garbin, an airplane mechanic of Hartland, Michigan, who has no criminal history, apologized to Whitmer. “I never realized what my actions would have caused to her, but also her family,"" he told the judge. ""I can’t even imagine to begin to think about the amount of stress and fear her family felt because of my actions, and for that I’m truly sorry.” Garbin broke with five co-defendants in January to submit a guilty plea to a federal kidnapping conspiracy charge. The deal included his agreement to testify against others charged in federal and state investigations, according to U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge. In the plea, Garbin said he and co-defendants were a part of a Michigan-based anti-government militia group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. The six were arrested and charged by federal authorities last October. Another eight men were hit with domestic terrorism charges in Michigan state court. All 14 are members or associates of the Wolverine Watchmen, prosecutors say. Prosecutors have said the suspected participants sought Whitmer's capture in retribution for wide-ranging public health orders imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including limits on social and business operations. Whitmer, who served as a co-chair of Joe Biden's presidential campaign, accused then-President Donald Trump of hyping up far-right groups as he denounced COVID mitigation efforts carried out in Democratic states. Officials say Garbin and others took multiple steps in planning the abduction, including a July 2020 meeting to practice using assault rifles; conducting surveillance of the governor's vacation home; and timing the distance to the nearest police station. Garbin’s plea agreement also claimed that Fox, one of the alleged ringleaders, had said at in a June meeting last year that “he wanted to recruit 200 people to storm the (Michigan) Capitol, try any politicians they caught for ‘treason’ and execute them by hanging on live television.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"After 'hard decisions' in 2020, U.S. Open returns with COVID rules eased",2861,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Fans and players will be expected to exercise caution despite COVID-19 restrictions being eased when the U.S. Open begins on Monday with capacity crowds in attendance, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) said. A year ago the tournament barred fans from attending, while players faced possible fines and expulsion if they exited the tournament's ""bubble"" without written consent as they were kept largely sequestered from New York City in Long Island accommodations. This year, they will again be able to dine at Manhattan restaurants and move freely outside their hotel rooms, with Cincinnati Masters winner Alexander Zverev enjoying seats behind home plate at the New York Mets' game against the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday. Players are required to submit to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in New York but have not been instructed to quarantine while awaiting results. Tournament director Stacey Allaster said that with almost 70% of the New York City population vaccinated, organisers were confident of staging the event safely. ""We heard loud and clear the athletes' mental health through these last 12 months, the isolation in the bubbles, was important, that they could have some flexibility,"" said Allaster. 'INFORMED DECISION' The biggest change for players and organisers is the return of fans at Flushing Meadows, which was eerily quiet in 2020. Their return means millions more in revenue for the USTA, which ran a $180 million budget deficit in 2020 as a result of hosting the tournament without spectators, USTA CEO Mike Dowse said. ""We did make a lot of hard decisions last year,"" said Dowse. ""We had significant salary reductions of our national staff, we downsized the national organization by over 23%. We tapped into our reserves."" New York City professional sports teams began welcoming back spectators months ago, with the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets opening their doors to fans in February. read more Fans at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center will not be required to show proof of vaccination or wear masks outdoors. ""We're still relying on the goodwill of people. The unvaccinated, although it's not going to be enforced, they really should be wearing masks,"" said Brian Hainline. ""It's like any other aspect of New York City, going to the baseball game, you make an informed decision."" The guidance comes as some players, including world number one Novak Djokovic and French Open runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas, have stated they are reluctant to take the vaccine. But Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, who are both ruled out of this year's U.S. Open through injuries, have both been vaccinated and have urged their fellow athletes to follow suit. read more The USTA said it did not know how many players at the U.S. Open are vaccinated.

"Takeda must face Actos antitrust claims, 2nd Circuit says",4523,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd lost its bid at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday to escape claims that it misdescribed its patents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improperly delay generic versions of its blockbuster diabetes drug Actos. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, affirmed that Takeda's characterization of its patents was incorrect, and that distributors and health plans can pursue their claims that Takeda misused them to illegally extend Actos' patent protection, monopolize the market and charge higher prices. Takeda and its attorney Steven Reed of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Steve Shadowen of Hilliard Shadowen, representing the health plans, or Thomas Sobol of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, representing the distributors. The Hatch-Waxman Act governs generic drug approvals, under which brand-name drugmakers list their patents covering a drug in the FDA's Orange Book. Takeda listed a patent on Actos' active ingredient, pioglitazone, which expired in 2011, as well as two patents on combinations with other ingredients, which expired in 2016. Drugmakers applying to make generic versions of a drug can certify that they believe its listed patents are invalid or that the generic doesn't infringe. The brand-name drugmaker can then file an infringement action that triggers an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval. Several companies sought to make generic Actos in 2003 and 2004 and certified their products wouldn't infringe the combination patents. Teva Pharmaceuticals sought approval without such a certification, asserting it would ""carve out"" the drug combinations from its label to avoid infringement. But Takeda said the combination patents covered the drug itself, not methods of using Actos that could be carved out. It sued the generic drugmakers and eventually reached settlements that allowed them to launch generics in 2012. Drug distributors and health plans that paid for the drug sued Takeda in 2013, arguing it illegally delayed generics by misrepresenting that the combination patents were drug patents in the Orange Book, preventing the generic companies from launching their products when the active-ingredient patent expired in 2011. U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams denied Takeda's motion to dismiss the case in 2019 but allowed the company to appeal. Takeda argued to the 2nd Circuit that it correctly described the combination patents as drug patents because their claims, which outline the scope of the invention, included the active ingredient and could be infringed by an Actos generic. But Wesley, joined by Chief Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston and Circuit Judge Susan Carney, said the combination patents don't claim the drug itself because their claims are ""broader than and different from"" the scope of Actos, and affirmed that the antitrust claims could continue. Actos' active ingredient is ""but a single active chemical among the several that comprise those patents,"" Wesley said. Takeda's reading of the Hatch-Waxman Act would also ""collapse method-of-use claims into drug product claims"" and undermine the law's ""delicate balance between rewarding innovation and stimulating generic market entry,"" Wesley said. The appeals court also rejected Takeda's argument that the plaintiffs had to show its decision to list the patents was unreasonable to sustain their claims. The FDA said in 2011 that Actos increased patients' risk of bladder cancer. Takeda paid more than $2 billion in 2015 to settle U.S. claims that it failed to warn users about the risk. The case is In re: Actos Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1994.

Special master to consider default against Endo in opioid trial,4101,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A New York judge has appointed a special master to advise him on whether to impose default judgment or contempt against drugmaker Endo International Plc for withholding evidence in a trial over its role in the opioid epidemic. Justice Jerry Garguilo in Suffolk County Supreme Court named Joseph Maltese, a now-retired judge in the state's Appellate Division, Second Department, at a hearing Wednesday morning. Garguilo said Maltese would deliver a report and the parties would have a chance to respond. Though Garguilo did not rule, he expressed concerns about Endo's conduct. He noted that the company had been sanctioned with default judgment over similar allegations in a separate case in Tennessee, which it ultimately settled for $35 million last month. The judge said the record appeared to show that Endo became aware of relevant discovery before jury selection began in June in New York. ""If we're just before the commencement of jury selection, why doesn't somebody get on the phone to the plaintiffs and say, 'Wait a second, we just came up with some information you should have?'"" Garguilo asked. The appointment of the special master drew a strenuous objection from the New York Attorney General's office, which is suing Endo and other drugmakers alongside Nassau and Suffolk Counties. John Oleske, a lawyer for the state, called the appointment ""a last-resort extension of mercy"" to Endo that would impose ""additional burdens"" on New York as it continues to try the case while combing through late-produced evidence. New York sought default judgment on Aug. 2, accusing Endo and its attorneys at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer of dumping ""vast troves of smoking-gun evidence"" mid-trial. The company and the firm have denied that any evidence was withheld deliberately. Garguilo subsequently entered an interim order requiring Endo to provide a list of late-produced evidence with information about its chain of custody by Aug. 4. The state said Endo failed to comply and moved for contempt. Garguilo on Wednesday said he agreed Endo had not complied with the interim order, though he said he would wait for Maltese to weigh in on whether it amounted to contempt. The disputed evidence included records of Endo sales' representatives visits to New York prescribers and other internal documents. In a new filing last week, the state said it had identified a previously unproduced email from a witness, a former Endo employee, to her husband expressing concerns about the company's marketing practices. The employee nonetheless testified in a deposition that the company always adhered to regulatory standards, according to the state. More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments accusing opioid manufacturers of falsely marketing opioid drugs as safe, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being used illegally. Johnson & Johnson and the nation's three largest distributors have offered to settle claims nationwide for $26 billion. Endo and its co-defendants in the New York trial – AbbVie Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – are not part of that settlement.

Delta Air Lines to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff,4380,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not be vaccinated against COVID-19. The move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic. A number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines (UAL.O), have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has especially hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels. President Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. Hours after Delta Air announced the surcharge, Canadian rival Air Canada (AC.TO)said workers who are not vaccinated by Oct. 30 will face termination or be sent on unpaid leave. It has also made full vaccination a condition of employment for new employees. Surging coronavirus infections have clouded the outlook for airline companies. American Airlines (AAL.O)said on Wednesday its August revenue was trending below its internal forecast due to a slowdown in bookings and a rise in cancellations. The comments came two weeks after Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) issued a profit warning, citing the impact of the Delta variant on its business. Shares of U.S. airline companies, however, have risen in the past two days on hopes that Monday's full approval of the Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration would drive up the vaccination rate and slow down new infections. In a staff memo, Delta Air Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1. He said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate. Wade Symons, partner and regulatory resources group leader at global consulting firm Mercer, reckons U.S. companies have reached a ""tipping point"" for taking stricter measures to motivate employees to get vaccinated. ""We anticipate more companies will announce vaccine mandates and surcharges in the coming weeks,"" he said. The firm's data shows a quarter of U.S. employers with workforces of 500 or more charge employees extra for company-sponsored healthcare plans if they use tobacco. Delta Air did not say whether its employees were subject to any other surcharges. PROOF OF INOCULATION A Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said. Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members. But since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated. In the memo, Bastian said 75 percent of Delta Air's workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said. While Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are ""strongly encouraging"" their employees to get vaccinated. American Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform. Bastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately. Any employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12. Those who test positive for the virus will be required to isolate and remain out of the workplace, Bastian said. The company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said.

Full 6th Circ. urged to rehear Ohio hospital's antitrust claims,3509,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Ohio-based hospital McLaren St. Luke's on Tuesday urged the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a decision that said a rival medical system did not violate antitrust law when its insurance subsidiary dropped it from its provider network. Filed by its lawyers at Honigman, St. Luke's petition seeking en banc review or panel reconsideration says the three-judge panel's Aug. 10 decision overlooked key pieces of evidence showing the alleged harm stemming from the change by the insurance arm of ProMedica Health Systems Inc. The panel ruling vacated a preliminary injunction that kept Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica from canceling contracts with St. Luke's. The case involves what the Federal Trade Commission has called an ""unsettled"" area of antitrust law: the duty, if any, owed from one firm to a competitor. The 6th Circuit panel said there is a high bar for such ""refusal to deal"" antitrust claims, since ""individuals and companies may do business with whomever they please."" In Tuesday's petition, Honigman partner David Ettinger said the panel ruling overlooked evidence that ProMedica's insurance subsidiary enjoyed ""significant benefits"" with St. Luke's as part of the provider network. Employers were attracted to the subsidiary based on its relationship with St. Luke's, according to the petition. Ettinger also argued in the petition that harm to reputation and goodwill can support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. ""It is hard to imagine how any commercial party could obtain a preliminary injunction under such a restrictive approach,” Ettinger wrote in Tuesday's court filing. Ettinger, who leads the firm's antitrust team, did not return a message seeking comment on Wednesday, and a lawyer for ProMedica at Davis Wright Tremaine did not immediately comment. The FTC in 2014 successfully challenged ProMedica's acquisition of St. Luke's as anticompetitive, and the 6th Circuit earlier upheld the commission's enforcement action. ProMedica's insurance subsidiary, Paramount Care Inc, kept St. Luke's as in-network as part of the unwinding of the merger. ProMedica ended its in-network relationship with St. Luke's after McLaren Health Systems in October 2020 agreed to buy the hospital and invest $100 million into it. McLaren's cancer services compete with ProMedica and ""could siphon off patients needing advanced care from ProMedica's hospitals,"" the 6th Circuit panel said earlier this month. Chief Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, sitting with Circuit Judges R. Guy Cole Jr and Chad Readler, ruled unanimously for ProMedica. The panel said ProMedica had a ""valid"" business reason for dropping its insurance contract with St. Luke's and that the hospital was aware a change in ownership could affect its status as an in-network provider. ""Every shrewd businessperson, and every athlete and politician to boot, intends to beat her competitors. Just so for companies, the most strategic of which hope to squash the competition by delivering a superior product,"" Sutton wrote. The case is St. Luke's Hospital v. ProMedica Health System Inc, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-3007. For ProMedica: David Gossett of Davis Wright Tremaine For St. Luke's Hospital: David Ettinger of Honigman"
FIFA's Infantino asks Premier League and LaLiga to release players for World Cup qualifiers,3497,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The English Premier League and Spain's LaLiga should release players for World Cup qualifiers next month to ""preserve and protect sporting integrity"", FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday. While the Premier League has refused to release players headed to countries on the United Kingdom's 'red list' due to strict quarantine rules on their return, LaLiga supported its clubs in refusing to release players for qualifiers in South America. ""I am calling on a show of solidarity from every member association, every league, and every club, to do what is both right and fair for the global game,"" Infantino said in a statement. ""Many of the best players in the world compete in leagues in England and Spain, and we believe these countries also share the responsibility to preserve and protect the sporting integrity of competitions around the world."" The Premier League said nearly 60 players were set to travel to 26 countries on Britain's ""red list"" while LaLiga said 25 players from 13 different clubs were affected, with more likely to follow when Ecuador and Venezuela announce their squads. read more England's strict rules would require players to quarantine for 10 days upon their return to the country, with the Premier League saying no exemption had been granted by the government for soccer players. The international break in September begins after this weekend's matches and runs for two weeks, with the Premier League resuming on Sept. 11. Premier League players would potentially miss two league matches if they quarantined on their return. The period would cover three games if the club was involved in the group stages of European club competitions which begin on Sept. 14. Italy's Serie A also released a statement later on Wednesday saying they would support clubs that do not release players who would have to quarantine on return. The league said FIFA's decision not to extend an exemption introduced last year amid the pandemic, which allowed clubs to refuse release of players for international duty on COVID-19 grounds, would put such clubs at a competitive disadvantage. The exemption allowed clubs to refuse to release players should travel restrictions be imposed or there be a mandatory period of quarantine or self-isolation of at least five days on their return. The temporary amendment was in place until April 2021. INFANTINO WRITES TO PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON Infantino said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for support. ""I have suggested that an approach similar to that adopted by the UK government for the final stages of the Euro 2020 be implemented for the upcoming international matches,"" Infantino added. London's Wembley Stadium hosted the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 last month. Official data published last week said the final was a ""superspreader"" event due to the level of COVID-19 infection found in or around the stadium on the day. Johnson has backed plans for a bid by the United Kingdom and Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup finals. The English Football League (EFL), which governs England's lower divisions, also said in a statement on Wednesday that their clubs had taken a ""collective decision not to release players for international matches"" in red-list countries. The matter first came to light on Monday when the Egyptian Football Association said Liverpool had refused to allow Mohamed Salah to travel to Africa for World Cup qualifiers.

Delta Air Lines wields Covid vaccine stick,2165,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It was always going to take effort to get some Americans on board with the Covid-19 vaccine. To all the personal and public health carrots, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) boss Ed Bastian on Wednesday added a stick. Unvaccinated U.S. employees on the company’s healthcare plan will face a $200 monthly surcharge. Bastian noted that 75% of Delta’s staff are vaccinated, that all employees hospitalized with Covid were not fully vaccinated, and that the average hospital stay has cost Delta $50,000 per person. But it goes beyond the direct costs. Delta and other travel businesses need the world to get Covid under control before they can get fully back to business. It’s also a similar justification to making health cover more expensive for smokers, and an easier argument now that Pfizer’s (PFE.N) jab is fully approved by U.S. regulators read more . Some employers have tried incentives like one-off payments . Others have simply mandated the vaccine in U.S. offices, including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) according to Reuters on Tuesday . Especially for a public-facing business like Delta's, imposing financial costs on voluntary refuseniks makes sense as the next step.

""We give you the warmest welcome to Mexico,"" said Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Martha Delgado as she greeted the robotics teammembers during a news conference at Mexico City's international airport late on Tuesday. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops from the country. The White House and U.S. allies are racing to complete the evacuation of all foreigners and vulnerable Afghans before an Aug. 31 deadline agreed with the Taliban, U.S. President Joe Biden said this week. read more The robotics team, made up of women and girls as young as 14, has been heralded for winning international awards for its robots and started work in March on an open-source, low-cost ventilator as the coronavirus pandemic hit the war-torn nation. The Taliban, which previously barred girls from schools and women from working when they ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s, has promised to prioritize women's rights and girls' education.

Picture taken April 15, 2020.REUTERS/Jalil Ahmad/File Photo Mexico has pledged to aid Afghan women and girls. Ebrard said on Aug. 18 that the country was processing refugee applications of Afghan citizens, especially women and girls, with the aid of Guillermo Puente Ordorica, Ambassador of Mexico in Iran. Tuesday's safe arrival in Mexico was made possible by an ""extensive international effort and coordination from a group of volunteers"" who helped the girls, according to a volunteer who requested anonymity for fear of the safety of the families that remain under Taliban control. Other members of the robotics team landed in Qatar in recent days. Greeting some of the 124 journalists and staff of Afghan and foreign media outlets who arrived from Kabul a few hours after the robotics team, on Wednesday morning, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said the decision to offer refuge followed a long tradition of Mexico welcoming people fleeing persecution. ""In this case, it's people who are risking their lives to inform, to communicate. People committed to freedom of expression,"" Ebrard said. Both Mexico and Afghanistan are considered among the most dangerous countries for journalists. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
J&J says booster dose increased antibodies in early-stage trials,3913,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) COVID-19 vaccine sharply increased levels of antibodies against the coronavirus, according to interim data from two small, early-stage trials, the company said in a press release on Wednesday. J&J has been under pressure to produce evidence of whether a booster shot would increase protection from its one-shot vaccine as the U.S. government prepares to roll out a booster campaign next month. The company plans to discuss the data with U.S. regulators as they devise their booster shot regimens. read more The preliminary data announced on Wednesday involved a total of 17 people. It found that a second dose of the J&J vaccine delivered six months after the first resulted in a ninefold increase in binding antibody levels over those seen 28 days after the first dose, the company said. The company did not release data on whether a second dose of its vaccine increases levels of neutralizing antibodies, which block the virus from entering cells. Those data are still being analyzed, said Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, but who was not involved in the J&J booster study. Unlike neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies tag the virus for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Barouch said increases in binding antibodies typically correlate with increases in neutralizing antibodies. Several countries, including the United States, have begun offering booster doses to vulnerable individuals, including the immunocompromised, as the Delta variant has spread and some vaccinated people have become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But those campaigns have excluded the J&J shot because there has been no evidence that a booster helps increase vaccine protection. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisers in particular have been waiting for word on how to advise immunocompromised individuals who received the J&J vaccine and are already recommended to receive a booster shot. According to J&J, the studies released Wednesday showed significant increases in binding antibody responses in participants aged 18-55 and in those 65 years and older who received a lower booster dose. The study summaries are being submitted to the preprint server MedRxiv in advance of peer review or publication in a journal. The results were released ahead of long-awaited results from J&J's large, two-dose vaccine trial. A spokesman said those results will be available in the coming weeks. In July, J&J published interim Phase 1/2a data in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed neutralizing antibodies generated by its vaccine remained stable eight months after immunization with a single dose. ""With these new data, we also see that a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine further increases antibody responses among study participants who had previously received our vaccine,"" Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&J's Janssen pharma division, said in a statement. ""We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination."" Several scientists have raised concerns that individuals who got the J&J shot would need boosters. One study by a team from New York University found a ""significant fraction"" of blood samples from recipients who got the J&J shot had low neutralizing antibodies against Delta and several other coronavirus variants. read more J&J said the company is working with the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization and other health authorities about delivering a booster shot with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

Algeria to allow more international flights in further easing of restrictions,1214,"ALGIERS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Algeria will increase the number of international flights it allows from Aug. 28, partly to help repatriate Algerians stuck abroad since air travel restrictions were imposed at the start of the pandemic last year. The country began gradually reopening its borders in June although arrivals must comply with strict health measures. State carrier Air Algerie will operate 32 international flights weekly, consisting of departures from and arrivals at three Algerian airports, the transport ministry said in a statement. It currently has nine flights arriving each week. The majority of flights, 24, will serve routes to France, where there is a large Algerian diaspora, and there will also be flights to Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, Turkey and Tunisia. Airlines from those countries will be permitted to operate the same number of flights to and from the North African nation. ""As part of reciprocity, (the number of Air Algerie flights) will be doubled by foreign airlines operating in Algeria,"" the statement said. Air Algerie suspended its international routes in March last year although it later operated some emergency flights. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID vaccine protection wanes within six months - UK researchers,3051,"LONDON (Reuters) - Protection against COVID-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months, underscoring the need for booster shots, according to researchers in Britain. After five to six months, the effectiveness of the Pfizer jab at preventing COVID-19 infection in the month after the second dose fell from 88% to 74%, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE COVID study showed. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77% to 67% after four to five months. The updated analysis was based on data from more than a million app users during the period December 8, 2020 to July 31, 2021, comparing self-reported infections in vaccinated participants with cases in an unvaccinated control group. (https://bit.ly/3kojsFV) More data is needed in younger people because participants who had their shots up to six months ago tended to be elderly as that age group was prioritised when the shots were first approved, said the study authors, who discussed the results in an online webinar (https://bit.ly/3gt4Rrp). ZOE Ltd was founded three years ago to offer customised nutritional advice based on test kits. The company's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app is a not-for-profit initiative in collaboration with King's College London and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Under a worst-case future scenario, protection could fall below 50% for older people and healthcare workers by the winter, Tim Spector, ZOE Ltd co-founder and principal investigator for the study, said. ""It's bringing into focus this need for some action. We can't just sit by and see the protectiveness slowly waning whilst cases are still high and the chance of infection still high as well,"" Spector told BBC television. Britain and other European nations are planning for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September. The U.S. government is preparing to provide third booster doses starting in mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago. ""This is a reminder that we cannot rely on vaccines alone to prevent the spread of COVID,"" said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. He cautioned that the results may have been distorted by the surge in overall cases in Britain in July. A separate British public health study found last week that protection from either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months. The Oxford University study found at the time that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively. That was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Delta to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff,2796,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not vaccinate against COVID-19. The move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic. A number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines, have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels. President Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. In a staff memo, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1. (https://bit.ly/3ybiWzW) Bastian said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate. A Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and a proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said. Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members. But since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated. In the memo, Bastian said 75% of Delta Air's workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said. While Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are ""strongly encouraging"" their employees to get vaccinated. American Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform. Bastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately. Any employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12. Those who test positive for the virus will be required to isolate and remain out of the workplace, Bastian said. The company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said."
Trial of ex-Volkswagen CEO likely to be delayed again,1617,"HAMBURG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The trial of former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn on charges of conspiracy to commit organised commercial fraud looks set to be delayed, a court probing the carmaker's diesel emissions scandal said on Wednesday. The case of the 74-year-old Winterkorn -- whom a German magazine report said needs a hip operation -- could be split off from four other Volkswagen executives who also face charges for their role in allowing diesel cars with illegal emissions-masking software to hit the road. If Winterkorn is not able to take part in the planned start of the trial on Sept. 16 due to health issues then proceedings against the other four will start without him, a court spokesperson said, although no final decision has been taken. The scandal, which was uncovered by U.S. authorities in 2015, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in refits, legal fees and settlements, and resulted in a drastic management and strategy overhaul. A lawyer for Winterkorn has said his client denied the charges. The trial had been due to start in February but has been repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Manager Magazine, which first reported on the delay, Winterkorn needs a hip operation, which would mean he would only be well enough for a trial by the middle of 2022. However, if the court waits for the completion of the trial against the other four executives, then the main proceedings against Winterkorn might only start in the second half of 2023.

"Digital mental health firms Ginger, Headspace to merge in $3 bln deal",2074,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 25 (Reuters) - Meditation app Headspace and video-based therapy services provider Ginger said on Wednesday they would merge in a deal valuing the combined company at $3 billion, as the COVID-19 pandemic spurs the use of virtual mental health care platforms. Founded in 2010, Headspace offers sessions, videos and articles on meditation and mindfulness which can be accessed on a mobile phone and has about 70 million users globally. The app has become incredibly popular in the past year and with the pandemic taking a toll on people's mental health, venture capital interest has increased in such companies. Ginger, which raised $100 million in March, provides members with access to unlimited self-guided care and 24/7 on-demand and scheduled coaching as well as video-based therapy and psychiatry support. Ginger, also founded in 2010, saw a more than four-fold rise in the number of people using its coaching services and a more than five-fold jump in therapy users in mid-July compared to the levels seen before the pandemic. Together, Ginger and Headspace will serve the employees of 2,700 companies. ""We felt like Ginger had this end-to-end mental health platform ...but if we really were going to solve this (mental health crisis) at scale, we needed to think prevention,"" said Russell Glass, chief executive officer of Ginger in an interview with Reuters. ""We needed to make sure people were getting access to care and in a much earlier part of their journey."" Russell Glass is set to helm the combined company, which would be called Headspace Health, upon the closing of the merger, expected in the last quarter of the year, the companies said. The combination with Ginger will enable Headspace to build healthy routines for people that last a lifetime, said CeCe Morken, CEO of Headspace."
WHO says no conclusive data yet on need for COVID-19 booster shot,422,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that the data on the benefits and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is inconclusive.

Vaccine inequity remains Achilles' heel of COVID-19 response in Americas-PAHO,2059,"BOGOTA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The unequal distribution of vaccines which protect against COVID-19 is the weak point in efforts to combat the disease in the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. ""Vaccine inequity remains the Achilles' heel of our response,"" PAHO Director Dr. Carissa Etienne said during the organization's weekly virtual briefing. ""A handful of companies produce all the world's supply of COVID-19 vaccines,"" Etienne said. ""Many of them are letting price and country of origin, not need, determine how doses are rolled out, so much of today's vaccine supply remains in the hands of wealthy nations around the world."" Countries are also suffering because of production delays, leaving them waiting for doses purchased months ago, she said. Almost 12 million vaccine donations from the United States, Spain, Norway, France and Sweden will not be enough to protect the hundreds of millions of people who remain vulnerable, Etienne said, adding just over 23% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean are fully vaccinated. PAHO will launch an effort to bring mRNA vaccine technology to the region and boost manufacturing efforts, she said. The situation in Haiti following an Aug. 14 earthquake which killed over 2,000 people remains serious, Etienne said. The country's health ministry has asked for additional surgical and trauma care support and PAHO is distributing supplies. Some 59 health facilities in the country's south were affected by the quake, she added, about half severely. Vaccine doses for Venezuelan migrants - millions of whom have fled their country for other parts of Latin America - are being acquired, including through the COVAX mechanism, PAHO's health emergencies director Dr. Ciro Ugarte said. It is important that undocumented migrants have access to shots, he added, not only to protect them but the communities where they live. The Americas reported over 1.5 million new COVID-19 cases last week and nearly 20,000 related deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID-19 hospitalisations fall in Russia's lone vaccine stronghold,3800,"BELGOROD, Russia, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Doctor Sergei Pashkov is on the front line of a rare success story for Russia's torpid COVID-19 vaccination campaign: In the Belgorod region where he works, 50% of adults have been fully vaccinated and pressure on hospitals has eased. The epidemiological picture in Belgorod, around 580 km (360 miles) south of Moscow, provides the best real-world evidence yet that mass inoculations of Russia's Sputnik V can reduce the number of serious COVID-19 cases. The European Union has yet to approve Sputnik V for use in the 27-nation bloc, citing the need for further information, though some individual member states have moved to buy it. ""There's practically nobody (in my infection ward),"" Pashkov, a doctor in the region's Krasnaya Yaruga district, told Reuters. In Russia, only 26% of adult residents had been fully inoculated as of Aug. 6, according to Reuters estimates. Shots have been available since January, but polls show many Russians are sceptical. By contrast, Belgorod, with a population of 1.5 million, has administered both vaccine doses, mostly Sputnik V, to 620,000 people so far and is recording fewer COVID-19 hospitalisations than other regions. The proportion of inoculated people - 50% of adults - puts it close to the 60% threshold that Moscow thinks is needed for herd immunity. World Health Organisation experts put the threshold at around 65-75%, which the Delta variant may push higher. Some experts estimate the herd immunity threshold is closer to 90% or more and that the idea of herd immunity itself may be threatened by future variants. The only place to vaccinate a bigger proportion of people with Sputnik V is the tiny Republic of San Marino that has administered the shots to most of its 34,000 population, a number too small to draw conclusions on the results of mass vaccinations. read more Authorities in Belgorod told Reuters the number of coronavirus cases per thousand people was 35.7% lower during the third wave of Russia's pandemic this summer than during the second wave last winter. Alexander Dragan, an independent data analyst, said that Belgorod had recorded the slowest increase in hospitalisations of any Russian region during this summer's case surge, citing an analysis of official data that he conducted. DOCTORS FINALLY ABLE TO REST Five doctors at four hospitals in the region told Reuters that they have had increases in COVID-19 cases but they were much lower than a surge in winter that they linked to vaccinations. ""The burden has become more even... Some doctors can even go on holiday,"" said Alyona Bogomazova, deputy chief doctor at Borisovka hospital. Russia does not publish nationwide hospitalisation figures. But the local administration said that the number of COVID-19 hospital in-patients was 30% lower in August than January. For comparison, Moscow recorded a much smaller drop of 6.2% fewer hospitalisations in June from December, according to Reuters estimates based on official data. Roman Protsenko, the head doctor of Belgorod city's hospital, said that the number of people in his intensive care unit had not fallen however. He said he thought that was because the virus had become more aggressive. He also said that only 1.8% of his in-patients had been vaccinated. Belgorod was one of the first Russian regions where authorities tried to boost vaccine uptake by giving additional payments to medical workers in May for administering more injections. Vaccinations in the region have remained officially voluntary unlike in dozens of other regions where they are mandatory for some. Belgorod's authorities say nobody has been forced to have the shots, but five people said earlier this year that they had come under pressure. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
In-form Barty prepared for U.S. Open success,3960,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Australian Ash Barty appears primed to be the most consistent women's number one since Serena Williams as she heads into the U.S. Open, while Naomi Osaka faces a difficult challenge in her title defence with a handful of contenders vying for their first Grand Slam title. Former world number one Karolina Pliskova and 23-year-old Aryna Sabalenka are seen as potential threats to rattle the field, even though Barty will be rolling into Flushing Meadows on a wave of momentum. Barty faced questions at the start of 2021 when she returned to competitive tennis having not played a match for 11 months but still holding the top women's singles ranking during last year's COVID-disrupted season. The 25-year-old Queenslander has laid all those doubts to rest with a tour-leading five WTA titles in 2021, including her second major title overall at Wimbledon, cementing her spot at the top and widening her lead over the chasing pack. The Australian was comfortable with her decision to not travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but since leaving her country in March Barty has been on the road. ""I think there was probably a part of me that was a little bit unsure of how this year would go for a couple of reasons,"" she told the WTA Insider after her Cincinnati win. ""One being, seven to eight months out of the tour last year, and two, being in a completely new adventure, a new scenario, a new feeling for me of being away from home for so long."" Barty is the bookmakers' favourite for a victory which would also give her a major trophy on all surfaces, with her maiden Slam coming at the 2019 French Open. ""I know the work that I've put in with my team. That's where all the gold lies. That's where all of our good stuff hides,"" said Barty, who claimed the No.1 ranking for the first time in June, 2019. While Barty has found the calmness and mental steel to handle the huge burden of expectations, Osaka has struggled with mental health issues, disclosing earlier this year that she has long suffered from bouts of depression. Osaka was marked as the heir apparent to Williams when she beat the American 23-times major winner in New York in 2018 for the first of her four Grand Slam titles. She has been unparalleled in recent years when it comes to success on hard courts and the Japanese has won four out of the last six hardcourt majors. Osaka won the 2021 Australian Open but then withdrew from the French Open and skipped Wimbledon. The 23-year-old failed to get past the third round of the Tokyo Olympics or last week's Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. ""These last few months obviously have been extremely difficult,"" ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver told reporters about Osaka. ""But she's going back to a place where she's won it twice. Usually when you have those kind of special memories, you can play some pretty good tennis."" Williams withdrew from the tournament on Wednesday, saying a hamstring injury needed more time to heal read more but a depth of talent remains in the women's competition. World number four Pliskova has produced a handful of strong performances since joining forces with Osaka's former coach Sascha Bajin late last year, and reached the Wimbledon final in July. She had previously never made it past the fourth round of the grasscourt Grand Slam. read more Earlier this month, she reached the final of the National Bank Open, where she lost to Italy's Camila Giorgi, and the semi-finals in Cincinnati. Former world number one Osaka has dropped down to third in the rankings with Sabalenka now behind Barty on the leaderboard. The Belarusian has won 10 WTA titles but had never gone beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam before last month's Wimbledon. Sabalenka has always had the power and the game to challenge for the title and her semi-final run at Wimbledon will give her the confidence required to be in the mix in New York.

Osaka's uneven play casts shadow over latest U.S. Open bid,2599,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Questions abound as Naomi Osaka prepares to mount a title defence at the U.S. Open following a series of lacklustre performances since she returned to the game after stepping away to focus on her mental health. Osaka shot to global fame on the back of her four Grand Slam titles and support of racial justice causes, with many seeing the hard-hitting 23-year-old as the heir apparent to Serena Williams. The Japanese player won the Australian Open earlier this year before opening up a conversation about mental health when she withdrew from the French Open and admitted she had struggled in the past with depression. She skipped Wimbledon but, since returning, has failed to get past the third round of the Tokyo Olympics or last week's Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. ""Osaka obviously has been having some struggles that she's come forward with. It's a little unpredictable,"" ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver told reporters on a call. ""But she's going back to a place where she's won it twice. Usually when you have those kind of special memories, you can play some pretty good tennis,"" she said. Osaka defeated Williams at Flushing Meadows in 2018 for the first of her two U.S. Open titles in a final where the American clashed with the chair umpire. World number two Osaka was praised for keeping her composure throughout the incident. ""I expect her to play well,"" Shriver said. ""But I do have more questions going into this U.S. Open than I would have had the last few months been smoother for Naomi."" OSAKA UPBEAT Osaka herself struck an upbeat tone after falling to Jil Teichmann in Cincinnati last week, saying the flip side of not having as many matches under her belt was that she was healthy. Osaka was hampered at last year's U.S. Open by a left hamstring injury. ""Last year, I played a lot of matches before the Open, and then I injured myself. So I don't really want to go through that again, even though it worked out,"" Osaka told reporters. She said the key was to stay grounded in the moment. ""I'm going into the tournament and taking it one match at a time, that's how I play really well,"" she said. ESPN analyst and former world number one John McEnroe said of Osaka: ""She needs to win a close one. She was double match point down against (Garbine) Muguruza at the (fourth round of the) Australian Open and pulled that out. Then she got on a roll. ""I think if she's going to do well, it's going to have to be one of those situations,"" he added. The U.S. Open runs from Monday until Sept. 12. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Brazil to give COVID-19 booster shots to elderly and vulnerable,1771,"SAO PAULO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Brazil will give booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to people with compromised immune systems and those over the age of 70 beginning inmid-September, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. Vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), or Pfizer (PFE.N) will be used for the booster shots, the ministry said in a statement. The information differs from remarks on Tuesday byHealth Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who had said vulnerable people and over 80-year-olds would receive an additional jab of the Pfizer. The rapid spread of the Delta variant and new research suggesting diminished effectiveness of vaccines over time has led many countries to propose an additional dose to reinforce protection. Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine, which was used for many elderly people in Brazil because it was the earliest available in large quantities, is not part of the plans outlined for the booster shots. The extra shots will be administered to those with vulnerable immune systems 28 days after their second dose. For those 70 and over, the ministry stipulated a six-month interval before applying a booster shot. Also starting next month, the gap between the first and second shots of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines will fall to eight weeks from 12 weeks for all those vaccinated in Brazil. Brazil has had more than 20.6 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 575,000 fatalities due to the virus. According to data from the Health Ministry, 123.9 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil, or about 59% of the population. Some 55.7 million had been completelyimmunized, or about 26.5% of the country's population, the data showed. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Supreme Court requires Biden to revive Trump's 'remain in Mexico' immigration policy,3704,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied President Joe Biden's bid to rescind an immigration policy implemented by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico awaiting U.S. hearings. The court, with three liberal justices dissenting, rejected the Biden administration's effort to block a Texas-based judge's ruling requiring the government to revive Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump. The brief order by the justices means that U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling now goes into effect. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it regretted the Supreme Court's decision and would continue to ""vigorously challenge"" the district court ruling. As the appeals process continues, it said, the agency will comply with the order ""in good faith"" and has begun discussions with Mexico. The court's decision referenced its 2020 ruling that thwarted Trump's bid to end a program introduced by Democratic former President Barack Obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants - often called “Dreamers” - who entered the United States illegally as children. Both cases concern whether the government followed the correct legal process in unwinding a previous administration's policy. A migrant boy, an asylum seeker sent back to Mexico from the U.S. under the ""Remain in Mexico"" program officially named Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), is seen near two members of the Mexican National Guard at a provisional campsite near the Rio Bravo in Matamoros, Mexico February 27, 2020. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo Biden, who has sought since taking office in January to reverse many of Trump's hardline immigration policies, rolled back the MPP program. Republican-led Texas and Missouri challenged the Democratic president's move. Biden's administration turned to the Supreme Court after Kacsmaryk ruled that the Trump policy would have to be reinstated and the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 denied the government's request for a delay. The 5th Circuit's decision said the Biden administration must implement the MPP program in ""good faith,"" which leaves the government some discretion in how to move forward. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized MPP, saying the policy subjected migrants, primarily from Central America, to dangerous conditions in Mexican border cities. Trump's administration cited a ""security and humanitarian crisis"" along the U.S.-Mexican border in refusing to allow migrants seeking asylum, because of a fear of persecution in their home countries, to enter the United States ahead of hearings before immigration judges. Reacting to the Supreme Court's order, Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the Trump policy during the previous administration, said the Biden administration must ""take all steps available to fully end this illegal program, including by re-terminating it with a fuller explanation."" Arrests of migrants caught crossing the U.S. southern border have reached 20-year highs in recent months, a development that Republicans blame on Biden's reversal of MPP and other Trump immigration policies. Biden's administration has left in place a separate Trump-era order that lets U.S. border authorities, because of the COVID-19 public health crisis, rapidly expel migrants caught at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum in the United States.

"Italy reports 59 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, 7,548 new cases",934,"MILAN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Italy reported 59 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, compared with 60 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 7,548 from 6,076. Italy has registered 128,914 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eighth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.502 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 4,023 on Wednesday, down slightly from 4,036 a day earlier. There were 34 new admissions to intensive care units, down from 46 on Tuesday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 499 from a previous 504.

Peloton faces pandemic uncertainties as it launches latest treadmill in U.S.,4358,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) investors want answers to two questions when the company reports results on Thursday: Will the Delta coronavirus variant drive a new surge in sales, and are customers ready to look past a recall by the exercise bike and treadmill makers? When it comes to COVID, most analysts say it is too early to predict if the stay-at-home stock will get another pandemic-fueled boost as vaccines could bolster confidence to leave home to work out at gyms. The launch of its new treadmill in the United States next week comes at an opportune time. Whether due to Delta or delays in workers returning to the office, use of independent gyms was down by 8% compared with pre-pandemic levels while interest in digital workouts and home equipment rose 21%, according to consulting firm ClubIntel. “If the Delta variant continues to delay the return to normality -- and worse yet, if it leads to incremental gym closures come winter time -- I do think that could be a positive catalyst for Peloton,” said James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. He added that “it's way too early to make that assessment right now.” He downgraded Peloton shares from outperform to neutral on July 14 due partly to uncertain future demand. The stock is down 34% from its high on Jan. 14. Cowen analyst John Blackledge maintains an outperform rating, noting a survey that suggests consumer attitudes on returning to gyms worsened in July given the rise of the Delta variant, which could drive near-term demand. Peloton’s new treadmill, analysts say, is key to its next leg of potential sales growth and putting behind a costly recall of its exercise machines over safety reasons. read more Peloton’s shares plummeted more than 15% in May after it recalled its Tread+ treadmill. Peloton initially continued to sell the Tread+ despite multiple injuries and a child’s death in March from being pulled under the machine. The lower-priced Tread will debut in the United States for $2,495. It had launched in Canada and the United Kingdom but was recalled in May for a manufacturing problem. Peloton announced it will begin selling the Tread in the United States and the United Kingdom on Aug. 30, and in Germany later this fall. The release comes after Peloton found a fix for faulty screws that caused the touchscreen console on the Tread to fall off. read more ""The success of Tread could mark an inflection point, given Peloton to date has relied on the popularity of its Bike and Bike+ products, while treadmills as a category represent a larger market,"" Blackledge added. Peloton is expected to report $922 million in revenue for the fourth quarter that ended June 30, up 52% from a year ago, according to an average of analyst estimates based on Refinitiv data. Net income was expected to be a loss of $137.9 million or 45 cents a share, compared with a profit of $89.1 million or 27 cents a share a year earlier. Its stock was down 0.5% on Wednesday morning. Although Peloton has suffered some recent supply chain challenges, it may be equipped to handle a potential boost in demand after investing $100 million to expedite overseas and air shipping from its manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The company is also expected to capitalize on its acquisition of equipment manufacturer Precor and is currently building a new production plant in Ohio, which will open in 2023. read more The company is also expected to announce plans to continue international expansion following its entry into the Australian market in July. According to Loop Capital analyst Daniel Adam, Peloton is just scratching the surface of its possible customer base, with roughly 5.4 million total Peloton members, and 2 million being “connected fitness” subscribers who pay monthly fees in order to use the company’s video workouts and equipment. As of 2020, the global gym industry was worth $96.7 billion with more than 184 million gym members in total, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA). In June, Peloton said it expected to sell three times more units in the quarter, which ended June 30, than in the same period in 2019. ""We think there is a massive opportunity ahead of us,"" Peloton Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said at an investor conference in early June.

"Canada's Royal Bank, National Bank profits beat estimates on provisions, loans",2807,"TORONTO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) and National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) both beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven primarily by the release of provisions set aside to cover bad loans. Earnings excluding the impact of provisions for both banks rose from a year ago, but Royal Bank's performance was viewed more positively by analysts as it was driven by higher fee income and lower expenses. At National Bank, lower net interest income and increased expenses somewhat eroded the benefit of higher fees. Both banks benefited from revenue growth in their personal and commercial banking divisions, as a pick-up in lending offset margin challenges. The more modest performances in their wealth management and capital markets businesses were largely expected, although National Bank's disappointed more than Royal Bank's. On Tuesday, Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia both beat estimates, with the former also posting strong pre-tax pre-provision (PTPP) earnings growth, while the latter's performance was driven almost entirely by lower provisions for credit losses (PCL). read more Royal Bank shares rose 1.2% to C$133.60 in morning trading in Toronto, on track for a record close, while National Bank's fell 0.7% to C$99.05. The Toronto stock benchmark (.GSPTSE) was flat. The outsized positive impact on earnings of the releases of reserves previously set aside to cover bad loans is expected to fade in coming quarters, and markets are focused on loan growth and fee revenues to determine the future health of Canadian banks. PTPP earnings at Royal Bank, Canada's biggest lender by market value, rose 6% from a year ago but fell 1% from the prior quarter. PTPP earnings at National Bank, the smallest of the country's Big Six lenders, were 15% higher than a year earlier but flat on the previous quarter. Analysts expected PTPP earnings across the country's biggest lenders would fall about 1% from the second quarter. While both banks released loan-loss reserves as impairments remained low, Royal Bank's came with some caution. ""While pandemic-related uncertainty has declined... uncertainty does remain elevated due to a rise in cases of the COVID-19 delta variant,"" Royal Bank's Chief Risk Officer Graeme Hepworth said on an analyst call. He added that impaired loan provisions are expected to trend above the bank's long-term average in 2022 as a result, but that this is expected to be offset by releases on performing loans. Royal Bank reported adjusted earnings of C$3 a share, up from C$2.23 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of C$2.71. read more National Bank had adjusted income of C$2.36 per share, versus C$1.66 a year earlier.

COVID vaccine protection wanes within six months - UK researchers,2898,"LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Protection against COVID-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months, underscoring the need for booster shots, according to researchers in Britain. After five to six months, the effectiveness of the Pfizer jab at preventing COVID-19 infection in the month after the second dose fell from 88% to 74%, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE COVID study showed. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77% to 67% after four to five months. The study was based on data from more than a million app users, comparing self-reported infections in vaccinated participants with cases in an unvaccinated control group. More data is needed in younger people because participants who had their shots up to six months ago tended to be elderly as that age group was prioritised when the shots were first approved, the study authors said. ZOE Ltd was founded three years ago to offer customised nutritional advice based on test kits. The company's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app is a not-for-profit initiative in collaboration with King’s College London and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Under a worst-case future scenario, protection could fall below 50% for older people and healthcare workers by the winter, Tim Spector, ZOE Ltd co-founder and principal investigator for the study, said. ""It's bringing into focus this need for some action. We can't just sit by and see the protectiveness slowly waning whilst cases are still high and the chance of infection still high as well,"" Spector told BBC television. Britain and other European nations are planning for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September. The U.S. government is preparing to provide third booster doses starting in mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago. ""This is a reminder that we cannot rely on vaccines alone to prevent the spread of COVID,"" said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. He cautioned that the results may have been distorted by the surge in overall cases in Britain in July. A separate British public health study found last week that protection from either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months. The Oxford University study found at the time that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively. That was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Moderna completes filing process for full approval of COVID-19 vaccine,1318,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) has completed the real-time review process needed for a full approval for its COVID-19 vaccine in people aged 18 years and above, the company said on Wednesday. The news comes within days of U.S. regulators granting full approval to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine, developed with the same mRNA technology as Moderna's. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines prompt the human body to make a protein that is part of the pathogen, triggering an immune response. U.S. health officials expect full approval for COVID-19 vaccines will help win over vaccine skeptics and prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. Moderna's completed submission includes data from a late-stage study that showed 93% vaccine efficacy, even through six months after administration of the second dose, the company said in a statement. As part of the submission, Moderna has requested a priority review designation for its vaccine, currently available in the United States for people aged 18 and older under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA in December. So far, the company has released more than 300 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Top Japan adviser blasts visit by IOC's Bach as COVID curbs expand,4427,"TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Japan's top medical adviser blasted International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach on Wednesday for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. In an unusually blunt statement from a Japanese official, Dr Shigeru Omi suggested Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony had undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC said Bach's visit had been authorised by the Japanese government and was meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. ""We had said over and over 'What kind of message will the Olympics send to the public?'"" Omi, the immunologist who chairs the government's coronavirus advisory panel that approved the emergency plan, said in a parliamentary session. ""We're asking people to work from home more. If (IOC) President Bach needs to give a speech (for the Paralympics), why couldn't he do it remotely? Why does he have to bother coming all the way here?"" Omi said, drawing applause from a few lawmakers. ""That kind of plain, common sense should function under these circumstances,"" he said. Bach spent over a month in Japan for the Olympic Games, which finished on Aug. 8. The IOC said on Wednesday his latest visit was ""part of the support of the IOC to the Paralympic Games and the Paralympic athletes and the strong cooperation between the IOC and the IPC"". Omi's comments underscored the frustration felt by many as the government grapples to bring infections under control. Citizens are growing weary of life under restrictions and companies are ignoring requests to promote work-from-home. Omi had voiced strong concerns about holding the 2020 Games, while others in the medical community opposed them. He had warned that infections could spread as the public interpreted hosting the Games as a sign that it was safe enough to go about their normal activities. HOSPITALS NEAR CAPACITY Nomura Research Institute executive economist Takahide Kiuchi estimated the latest state-of-emergency expansion would lead to an additional economic loss of about 420 billion yen ($3.8 billion), bringing the total fallout from Japan's fourth round of emergency curbs to 3.84 trillion yen. That dwarfs the 1.68-trillion-yen boost the economy was expected to see from holding the Olympic and Paralympic Games, he estimated. The government will decide this week to tap an additional 1.4 trillion yen from reserves for the additional costs of dealing with the pandemic, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said, adding that about 60% of the public will be fully vaccinated by the end of September. ""I've done my utmost to promote coronavirus vaccination,"" he said. Still, months of emergency curbs in Tokyo and surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of the city's critical care beds are occupied. The latest state-of-emergency expansion will add Hokkaido, Aichi, Hiroshima and five other prefectures starting from Friday through to Sept. 12. Another four prefectures will be placed under more limited ""quasi-emergency"" measures, bringing the regions under those curbs to a total of 12 out of Japan's 47 prefectures. ""Maintaining the health system is the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Suga said. With hospital beds filled to or nearing capacity, many people have been forced to convalesce at home with some dying before they can get treatment. Securing oxygen stations and nurses, as well as considering the use of antibody cocktails for outpatients, were among the priorities, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said earlier. ""The working-age demographic is the driving force (behind the rise in infections),"" Nishimura said. ""We need to halve the movement of people."" He added that infections transmitted by children as new school terms start were another concern. Omi, the medical adviser, later said it was important to give vaccines to teachers, including at nursery schools. He also backed antibody tests ahead of physical activities at schools. The government reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths for Tuesday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Just over half the Swiss population has been fully vaccinated, Health Minister Alain Berset said, but a third of adults remained unjabbed. He pointed to lower vaccination rates than in neighbouring countries. ""There are still very many people who could be infected,"" he told a news conference in Bern, adding 90% of COVID-related hospital and intensive care unit admissions related to individuals who had not received the vaccine. read more The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtenstein rose by 3,212 on Wednesday, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. The Swiss COVID-19 certificate provides proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test result. The requirement would cover events as well as indoor areas of restaurants and bars. Recreational sites like cinemas and museums, sports centres and cultural activities could be affected, the government said as it launched consultations with regional authorities which will run until Aug. 30. ""There are no short cuts in a pandemic,"" Berset said, saying the certificates were an important tool to avoid resorting to broader lockdowns as hospitals get swamped. ""The pressure would be massive, the situation would be absolutely chaotic,"" he said. The agreement with Pfizer for delivery of 7 million doses in both 2022 and 2023, with an option to double that, remains subject to a modified Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being authorised for use by drugs regulator Swissmedic, the government said.

Retailers agree to extend Bangladeshi garment workers' safety pact,3346,"DHAKA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Major global retailers agreed on a two-year pact with garment workers and factory owners in Bangladesh, extending a pre-existing agreement that makes retailers liable to legal action unless their factories meet labour safety standards. The statement, signed by the deal's deputy director Joris Oldenziel and representatives for UNI Global Union and IndustriALL Global Union, confirms the content of a copy of the pact, exclusively seen by Reuters earlier on Wednesday. ""This is a legally binding agreement between companies and trade unions to make ready-made garment (RMG) and textile factories safe,"" the statement said. ""The renewed agreement advances the fundamental elements that made the accord successful."" The original agreement, known as the Bangladesh Accord, was due to expire on Aug. 31. The new version comes into force on Sept. 1. and is named the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry to reflect its wider reach. Some 200 retailers signed up to the accord in 2013, including retail giants H&M (HMb.ST), Inditex (ITX.MC), Fast Retailing's Uniqlo (9983.T), Hugo Boss (BOSSn.DE), and adidas (ADSGn.DE). A list of those that have also signed up to the extension will be made available on Sept. 1, sources said. A spokesperson for Uniqlo said they had not yet seen the new accord, but they ""generally support a new binding agreement... that has independent oversight and can be expanded to other countries."" H&M, Inditex, Hugo Boss and adidas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The five-year accord, struck in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 that killed more than 1,100 garment workers, instituted an independent body that held thousands of inspections and banned unsafe factories from supplying its signatory buyers. That helped to make some 1,600 factories safer for 2 million workers, labour activists say. Under a transition deal agreed in 2018 after the original accord expired, a newly-formed body, the Ready-Made Garments Sustainability Council (RSC), which brings together unions, brands, and factory owners, took over the work of running factory inspections. However, the RSC did not take over one portion of the accord - the ability for retailers to be tried in court in the country in which they are domiciled if they fail to meet their obligations, including cutting ties with factories that do not meet the accord's standards. Signatories also agreed to discuss within six months to which countries the accord could be extended, with the aim of establishing it in at least one other country within two years, it said. Negotiations over the accord's extension stalled in May when U.S. retailers resisted agreeing to the legally-binding aspect of the agreement, sources said. read more Retailers, including Target (TGT.N), Walmart (WMT.N), VF Corp (VFC.N), which did not want to sign the original accord in 2013 formed a parallel alliance with similar functions, but no legal powers of enforcement. Those leading the talks had hoped to negotiate an extension that U.S. retailers would also be willing to adopt, sources said in May. But Walmart told Reuters on Tuesday it was not part of the accord's extension. Target and VF Corp did not respond to requests for comment. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Japan PM, ruling party executive hold talks on party leadership race",2495,"TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga held talks on Wednesday with a powerful ruling party executive on a party leadership vote that will decide who leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the next election due by November. The ruling LDP vote is expected to take place on Sept. 29. The executive, Toshihiro Nikai, said this week he backs Suga's re-appointment as party chief, a position ensuring Suga would stay on as prime minister and take the party helm in the looming general election. Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri daily, said on Wednesday that in addition to Nikai's faction, the leadership of four other main groups in the LDP also favoured Suga for the top job, although younger, more vulnerable MPs opposed the unpopular premier. Suga took office last September after Shinzo Abe quit, citing ill health, and his term expires at the end of next month. The premier's ratings have fallen below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections, and some in the party want to replace him before the general election. There had been speculation that Suga may aim to first call a general election, win a majority of seats, then use the victory to help him win another term as party leader. But Kyodo news agency, citing unnamed sources, said late on Tuesday Suga was not planning to dissolve the lower house of parliament, a key step for calling a snap election, before the party leadership vote. This arrangement appeared to have been confirmed during the talks on Wednesday, where Suga and Nikai agreed the party leadership race would go ahead, Kyodo said. At an evening news conference on the expansion of the COVID-19 state of emergency to eight more prefectures, Suga remained vague on the timing of the elections. ""As for dissolving the lower house of parliament and holding a general election, choices are getting slim. I've been saying repeatedly that the top priority is our coronavirus response. I want to decide with that in mind,"" he said. Suga has repeatedly said he will run in the leadership contest for another term, though a former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, has firmed up his decision to challenge him in the party vote, according to public broadcaster NHK. LDP members of parliament and grassroots party members are expected to be eligible to vote in the poll. Nikai played a central role in ensuring Suga's victory in the previous LDP leadership race last year. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Sydney hospitals battle coronavirus as daily infections hit record,3583,"SYDNEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Sydney's COVID-19 infections hit a daily record on Wednesday, putting parts of the health system under pressure, officials said, calling for vaccinations to be stepped up to stem the tide of hospital admissions. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, New South Wales (NSW) state reported 919 new cases amid a growing Delta variant outbreak, taking Australia's daily case numbers to a new pandemic high just below 1,000. New infections in greater Sydney reached 838, eclipsing Sunday's record of 830 cases for the whole state. Some 85% of the state's total infections lie in greater Sydney. A total of 113 people in the state are in intensive care, with 98 of those unvaccinated. ""This highlights ... the fact that vaccination is the key. We need to increase those vaccine coverage levels,"" NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said during a televised media briefing in Sydney, the state capital. Australia, grappling to control a third wave of the coronavirus, has locked down more than half of its 25 million population, including its largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and is accelerating an initially sluggish vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at least one dose. Westmead Hospital, one of the largest in Sydney's hard-hit western suburbs, has reduced ambulance arrivals for COVID-19 patients for 24 hours and shifted critical patients to other hospitals, an internal note shared on Twitter by NSW lawmaker Cate Faehrmann showed. Asked about the changes, state Health Minister Brad Hazzard acknowledged the health system is working under pressure but said the situation is still manageable. A masked woman with an umbrella walks with a child through the quiet city centre during a lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Sydney, Australia, August 24, 2021.

Around 80% of cases have been detected in Sydney's west. In neighbouring Victoria, new cases fell for a second straight day to 45, down from 50 a day earlier, as officials sought to boost the vaccine rollout by allowing anyone over 16 to book an appointment from Wednesday. REOPENING PLANS The spike in cases comes as Australia's federal government pressed states to stick to a four-stage national reopening plan agreed last month, as some have suggested delays given the persistently high new daily case numbers in Sydney. read more Treasurer Josh Frydenberg warned state leaders on Wednesday that current emergency economic supports may be withdrawn when the country hits a 70%-80% COVID-19 vaccination rate, even if states and territories decide to retain border controls. ""There should be no expectation on behalf of premiers and chief ministers that our emergency economic support will continue at the scale that it is currently,"" Frydenberg told broadcaster Seven News. Despite the recent Delta outbreaks, Australia's coronavirus numbers are still relatively low, with just over 46,600 cases and 986 deaths. Deaths from the latest outbreak have risen to 76, although the death rate has slowed from last year. Virus-free Queensland said it would pause arrivals from NSW and Victoria states, and the Australian Capital Territory for two weeks from Wednesday to help ease pressure on its hotel quarantine system.

"Denmark, Costa Rica seek alliance to speed up the end of oil and gas",5202,"BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Denmark and Costa Rica are trying to forge an alliance of countries willing to fix a date to phase out oil and gas production and to stop giving permits for new exploration, government ministers said and documents showed. Burning fossil fuels is the main source of the greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet, but so far there has been no collective government action to end oil and gas production. ""Restricting domestic oil and gas production in line with what is required to live up to the Paris Agreement goals will be the core focus for BOGA,"" a draft of the rules for the alliance said, referring to the group's name - the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).

To become a full member of the alliance, countries must promise to end new licensing rounds for oil and gas production on their territories, as well as to phase out existing production, the draft said. The draft could change before the expected launch of the BOGA at the U.N. climate summit in November in Glasgow, Scotland. Countries could become second-tier members if they have taken some steps to limit oil and gas output, such as ending public financing of it abroad or reforming fossil fuel subsidies. LEVEL OF SUPPORT UNCLEAR Danish climate and energy minister Dan Jorgensen told Reuters Denmark, which is co-leading the initiative with Costa Rica, was talking to many countries, but it was too early to say how many would join the alliance. One of the largest European oil and gas producers, Denmark last year banned new North Sea oil and gas exploration and committed to ending its existing production by 2050. ""Very few countries have taken such steps and we hope that this alliance will be something that will be noticed and hopefully inspire others to join,"" Jorgensen said. Costa Rica has never extracted oil, but is considering a bill to permanently ban fossil fuel exploration to ensure no future governments do so. ""Costa Rica represents the commitment and decision of a developing country that has the possibility to explore, makes a brave decision and decides to go for another development model and rides into the economy of the future,"" Costa Rica's environment minister Andrea Meza said. New Zealand, which banned new permits for offshore oil in 2018, told Reuters it had been approached by Denmark and was ""in the process of learning more about this initiative"". Costa Rica's Meza said the countries the alliance had approached included Portugal and Spain. Spain did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Portugal said it had not applied for membership of the alliance yet. The United Kingdom, which is hosting the U.N. climate summit December and has not committed to phase out its oil and gas production or halt exploration, declined to comment on its involvement. A UK government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the government is engaging with Denmark on the alliance. However, some large producers - including Norway, western Europe’s top oil and gas producer, are not yet involved. ""We’ve not been contacted in this regard,"" Norwegian deputy energy minister Tony Tiller told Reuters. PARADOXIAL SITUATION As a coalition of the willing, BOGA is unlikely to touch major oil and gas producers, such as Saudia Arabia or Russia, whose economies depend on fossil fuels, and which have shown no interest in curbing production. But part of BOGA's aim is to redefine what counts as climate leadership from goverments. Large countries' climate change targets tend to focus on reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels, but rarely limit the production of the fuels themselves. ""We are in a paradoxical situation right now where many countries have pledged to become carbon neutral but are actually still planning to produce oil and gas after that date,"" Jorgensen said. The United States, the world's largest producer of both oil and gas, this year pledged to halve its emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels. The U.S. government did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is involved in BOGA. Of the few countries that have taken action to ban fossil fuel exploration and production, France has committed to do so by 2040, and Spain by 2042.

Thailand develops robotic system to squeeze out more vaccine doses,3033,"BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - As Thailand struggles with its worst coronavirus outbreak yet, researchers in the country have developed a machine to draw out COVID-19 vaccine doses more efficiently and optimise lower-than-expected supplies. Using a robotic arm, the ""AutoVacc"" system can draw 12 doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine in four minutes from a vial, according to researchers at Chulalongkorn University, who made the machine that has been used at the university's vaccination centre since Monday. That is up 20% from the standard 10 doses drawn manually, they said. The machine only works on AstraZeneca multi-dose vials currently and labels show each vial can provide 10 to 11 doses. ""The machine guarantees with accuracy that we can gain an extra 20% from each vaccine vial - from 10 to 12 doses,"" said Juthamas Ratanavaraporn, the lead researcher of the team at the university's Biomedical Engineering Research Center.""The extra 20% that we get means that if we have AstraZeneca for 1 million people, this machine can increase the number of doses to 1.2 million people,"" said Juthamas. While some health workers using low dead space syringes (LDSS) that aim to reduce wastage can draw up to 12 doses per vial, it requires manpower and a high level of skill, she said. ""This could drain a lot of the health workers' energy. They would have to do this every day for many months,"" Juthamas said. Thailand had kept COVID-19 largely under control for much of the pandemic, but more virulent variants like Delta have sent cases and deaths soaring since April, ramping up pressure on authorities to increase the pace of vaccinations. A vaccine extraction machine called AutoVacc, designed by the Chulalongkorn University's Biomedical Engineering Research Center to extract extra doses out of AstraZeneca vaccine vials, is seen in Bangkok, Thailand August 23, 2021. Picture taken August 23, 2021. REUTERS/Juarawee Kittisilpa So far, around 9% of Thailand's population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated, with the rollout hindered by lower-than-anticipated vaccine supplies. The research team say they should be able to produce 20 more AutoVacc units within three or four months, but that government funds and support would be needed to expand across the country. The prototype machine costs 2.5 million baht ($76,243), including other materials like syringes, said Juthamas, adding that while they were open to export opportunities, that was something for the future. They also plan to make similar machines to use with the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines, she added. Juthamas said the machine was aimed at removing burdens on health workers. Thailand has reported around 1.1 million COVID-19 infections and 10,085 deaths in total, pushing parts of the health system to the brink. ""When the health workers are too tired, there are also chances of human error, so we should let the machines work on this,"" she said.

"U.S., China accuse each other of 'bullying' nations",5019,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday again charged China with bullying its Southeast Asian neighbours, the second time in two days she has attacked Beijing during a regional visit, as Washington tries to rally regional partners to take on China's growing economic and military influence. The Chinese foreign ministry shot back on Wednesday and accused the U.S. of meddling in regional affairs and disrupting peace. Earlier in the day, Chinese state media accused Harris of seeking to drive a wedge between China and Southeast Asian nations with comments in Singapore that Beijing used coercion and intimidation to back its unlawful South China Sea claims. Speaking in Hanoi on Wednesday, Harris said there was a need to mount pressure on China over its maritime claims and offered to support Vietnam in several key areas, including enhancement of maritime security to take on Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. ""We need to find ways to pressure, raise the pressure…on Beijing to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to challenge, its bullying and excessive maritime claims,"" said Harris during a meeting with Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Harris offered Vietnam more visits by U.S. warships and aircraft carriers, vaccines and aid to tackle COVID-19 and announced the launch of several programs to help combat climate change, according to a White House official who did not wish to be named. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to take on China globally. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contains gas fields and rich fishing grounds. China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea and objects to foreign warships sailing through what it claims is its sovereign waters. The U.S. Navy regularly conducts ""freedom of navigation"" operations through the disputed waters, which China objects to, saying they do not help promote peace or stability. In 2016, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled against China's claim, but Beijing has rejected the ruling. ""While pointing a finger at China and accusing it of 'coercion' and 'intimidation', Harris wilfully ignored her own hypocrisy in attempting to coerce and intimidate regional countries to join Washington in its scheme to contain China,"" the state run China Daily said in an editorial responding to Harris's comments in Singapore. Harris's Singapore speech was a baseless attack on China, the editorial said. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris arrives for the second leg of her Asia trip, in Hanoi, Vietnam, August, 24, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/Pool ""It seems that the United States' only commitment to Southeast Asia is its dedicated efforts to drive a wedge between the Southeast Asian nations and China,"" it added. The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century as it cements its pivot towards Asia. Southeast Asia has seen a series of high-profile visits by top administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who visited Hanoi in late July. Harris's arrival in Hanoi was delayed on Tuesday after the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam said it had detected an ""anomalous health incident"", potentially related to the mysterious Havana Syndrome. read more During the delay, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China's ambassador to Vietnam held a previously unannounced meeting, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not take sides in foreign policy. The Chinese ambassador promised a donation of 2 million COVID-19 vaccines during the meeting. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and Vietnam is heavily reliant on materials and equipment from China for its manufacturing activities. Their ruling Communist Parties maintain close ties, but Vietnam and China have been embroiled in a longstanding dispute over maritime claims in the South China Sea. The tensions have propelled Vietnam into being one of the most vocal opponents of Beijing's claims in the disputed waterway and Hanoi has received U.S. military hardware, including coastguard cutters. On Wednesday, Harris offered the deployment of a third U.S. Coast Guard cutter, a fleet of 24 patrol boats, base facilities, piers, law enforcement training and other joint activities that help Vietnam bolster its maritime security. Ties between Hanoi and Washington have grown closer more than four decades after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, and Vietnam has quietly endorsed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy because it takes a hard line against China in the disputed waters. Analysts say Vietnam wants to upgrade its diplomatic relationship with the United States to a ""strategic partnership"" but is concerned such a move would anger Beijing.

Indonesia survey shows president's approval hit by handling of pandemic,2312,"JAKARTA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo's approval rating has fallen to the lowest level in five years on the back of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections, a survey released on Wednesday showed. Conducted by pollster Indikator Politik Indonesia, the survey showed that 59% of respondents were satisfied with the president, the lowest ranking since March 2016. The survey, which involved 1,220 respondents, was conducted between July 30 to Aug. 4, while the country was in the throes of a virulent virus wave that led to overflowing hospitals and oxygen shortages on the densely populated island of Java. Indonesia has recorded more than 4 million cases of the coronavirus, and over 129,000 deaths, among the highest tallies in Asia. ""While the lower approval rating for Widodo is mainly caused by the pandemic and the government's largely inconsistent and confusing responses to the health crisis, it is unlikely the only factor,"" said Todd Elliot, a senior analyst at Concord Consulting. ""Trust in a government in Indonesia normally decreases if the economy is perceived as underperforming and the latest round of coronavirus curbs have hit businesses particularly hard."" The president said last week in his annual state of the nation speech that there was a need to strike a balance between health and economic interests during the pandemic. read more Overall, 54.3% of respondents surveyed said they trusted the president to properly manage the health crisis, while perceptions of the country’s economic situation were the worst since 2004. The survey indicated widespread dissatisfaction with social restrictions intended to stem the spread of the virus that have been in place since early July. Restrictions were eased on Monday in certain regions, including in Jakarta, to allow for limited capacity at malls, restaurants and places of worship after a recent drop in cases. Only 42% of respondents agreed with the curbs, the survey showed. With more than 50% of Indonesians employed in the informal sector, the curbs have impacted people's livelihoods hard with 79.2% of respondents saying their income had declined during the pandemic, and 53.3% describing their household economic situation as worse, or much worse.

U.N. sees massive drop in COVID vaccinations in Afghanistan after Taliban takeover,2221,"BRUSSELS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - In the first week following the Taliban conquest of Kabul, COVID-19 vaccinations in Afghanistan have dropped by 80%, the U.N. agency UNICEF said, warning that half of the few doses delivered to the country so far are close to expiry. The Taliban seized control of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15, having already captured most of the country earlier in the month after the United States decided to withdraw military forces after 20 years of war. Since the Taliban takeover ""there's been an 80% drop in people reached with COVID-19 vaccines,"" a spokesperson for UNICEF told Reuters. In the week starting on Aug. 15, 30,500 people had been vaccinated in 23 of the 34 provinces of the country, whereas the previous week 134,600 people were inoculated in 30 provinces, according to figures provided by UNICEF, which coordinates the rollout of COVID-19 shots distributed across the world by the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine programme Covax. ""The drop is understandable, as in situations of chaos, conflict and emergency, people will prioritize their safety and security first,"" the UNICEF spokesperson said, noting the U.N. agency has been calling on all Afghan healthcare workers, including women, to return to work. The spokesperson declined to comment about whether the drop in inoculations was also the result of Taliban's possible vaccine scepticism, but warned about risks caused by a protracted slowdown in the vaccination campaign. Nearly 2 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine delivered to Afghanistan, which is about half of the total so far, expire in November, the UNICEF spokesperson said. WHO data show that only 1.2 million doses had been administered as of Aug. 20 in Afghanistan, which has a population of 40 million. Gavi, which co-leads Covax with the WHO, said the programme has so far delivered over 4 million doses to Afghanistan. ""Our priority today is to work with UNICEF and WHO country offices (..) to ensure our ability to continue the country's COVID-19 vaccination programme,"" a Gavi spokesperson told Reuters, declining to comment on whether vaccinations had been hampered by the Taliban.

Analysis: Inflation vs jobs hole: A tradeoff the Fed still hopes to skirt,6201,"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's year-old promise to drive U.S. employment to new heights came at a wrenching moment last August, with 12 million jobs still missing due to the pandemic, inflation cratering to half the central bank's target, and no clear endgame for the worst health crisis in a century. Then came three vaccines, a steady jobs recovery, trillions more dollars in fiscal stimulus, the fastest economic growth in 40 years - and surging prices. A steady shift in Fed rhetoric since inflation jumped in the spring has now triggered debate about how deep the Fed's new commitment to jobs truly runs, and how long it will tolerate high inflation as it waits for a ""broad and inclusive"" rebound in employment. No decisions have been made. The Fed is actively talking about when to reduce its $120 billion per month emergency bond purchases, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell may discuss that in Friday remarks to a virtual iteration of its annual Jackson Hole research conference. The more consequential call over when to raise interest rates from near zero remains, in all likelihood, far down the road. But with each successive report showing inflation above the Fed's 2% target, the tone has shifted. Fed officials now readily acknowledge inflation may be more persistent than they thought. Moreover, some are lowering expectations of a full rebound to the pre-pandemic level of jobs or labor force participation. The debate won't be resolved soon. But the suddenly two-sided nature of the discussion has, to some, cast the value of the Fed's new approach into doubt. ""I think they have lost their nerve,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. In recent comments, ""they have not reinforced their commitment to broad and inclusive gains"" in the labor market. Richard Clarida, the Fed's influential chair, would disagree. At a recent presentation to the Peterson Institute, he said his outlook is for inflation above 2% for three years running, for unemployment so low by the end of 2022 that gains would be broadly felt and jobs returned to the pre-pandemic level, and a rate increase in 2023 ""entirely consistent"" with the Fed's new approach. INFLATION VS JOBS Arguably the last few inflation readings, the latest being almost twice the targeted 2% level, would have been confronted more aggressively by previous Feds. Some feel a tougher approach may be needed now. ""It is getting a little old to say that this is a transitory increase in prices,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon, pointing to surveys showing businesses ready and able to pass through price hikes. ""If firms say they are worried about prices paid and they have pricing power then...we don’t have price stability. The wheels are greased for costs to pass through."" Under the new framework, though, the Fed has pledged not to nip job growth in the bud and, to be certain inflation hits the 2% target on average, will allow it to go above that level ""moderately...for some time."" When the new strategy was rolled out, however, it carried an even deeper sort of pledge. Policymakers have long seen tension between unemployment and inflation. If inflation gets too high, the Fed can tame it through rate increases, albeit it at the cost of higher unemployment. When inflation is weak or unemployment high, it can cut rates and trade more jobs for higher prices. Over 10 years of economic expansion after the 2007-to-2009 recession, that relationship did not hold. As unemployment fell, inflation remained muted, and Fed officials concluded they could exploit that and take more inflation risk to create the type of ""hot"" economy and robust job market that helps the less well-off. Equity is not a goal addressed in the Fed's congressional mandate, but officials have given the issue more attention as the economic costs of inequality have become better appreciated. The quandary arose when the pandemic reanimated what the Fed thought it had escaped: conflict between inflation and jobs. In the thick of the framework debate in 2019 the Fed saw ample jobs and low inflation; now inflation is high, but with 6 million fewer people working than before the pandemic. That has forced an earlier-than-expected reckoning over issues left unresolved in the new strategy. What does ""moderately"" mean when it comes to an inflation overshoot? How fully can the economy recreate the pre-pandemic conditions where, for instance, unemployment hit record lows for African Americans and the share of adults employed or looking for work was climbing steadily? The ""labor force participation rate"" hit 63.4% in January 2020. It's now 61.7%. Black unemployment hit a record low 5.2% in August of 2019, and even then was 1.8 percentage points higher than for whites. As of July it was 8.2%, compared to 4.8% for whites. AN 'AMBITIOUS' GOAL With inflation gnawing, some Fed officials have begun nipping at what to expect from the jobs recovery. Clarida, rather than seeing a full rebound of the labor force participation rate, says it can return to an unspecified ""demographic trend"" dragged lower by the aging population. Where Powell has talked about the plight of displaced workers, he also notes the number of additional people, perhaps 2 million or more, who retired during the pandemic - thus lengthening the time to get back to the pre-pandemic level of jobs, and increasing the likelihood the Fed may raise interest rates before that happens. Much depends on inflation. If it proves the product of global supply shocks and reopening, and recedes on its own, the potential tradeoff with the job market eases. If not, then the Fed's priorities will be tested in ways not envisioned when the new strategy was approved. ""They set a very ambitious goal. This is year one...We don't know if it's successful for at least a couple of years,"" said Edward Al-Hussainy, senior rates and currency analyst for Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""The first priority is still the recovery in the labor market...People are starting to lose focus on that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Thailand urges pregnant women to get vaccinated, cites higher risks",1740,"BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Thailand's coronavirus task force on Wednesday called on pregnant women in the country to get vaccinated against COVID-19, citing a higher risk of deaths among those who become infected with the coronavirus. ""We have a target of vaccinating 500,000 women who are at least 12 weeks pregnant, but only 2,078, or 0.4%, have received two doses,"" Apisamai Srirangsan, a spokesperson for the coronavirus task force, told a news briefing. ""Pregnant women are 2.5 times more likely to die after an infection than others due to changes to body shape that makes breathing more difficult,"" said Apisamai. Thailand has fully vaccinated about 9.7% of its overall population of over 66 million with a combination of China’s Sinovac (SVA.O) vaccine and AstraZeneca shots (AZN.L). The Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) vaccine is being offered to pregnant women and as a booster to medical workers who had previously received two shots of Sinovac. Health ministry data showed since April 2,327 pregnant women had been infected, of which 22 had received one vaccine dose. So far, 53 women and 23 unborn babies had died, the data showed. A study by British scientists in April showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 faced higher risks than previously known such as premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care and possible death. Women who are at least three months pregnant can safely get inoculated with any vaccine, Apisamai said, adding that immunity could also be transferred to the child. Thailand has reported 1.1 million cases of the coronavirus and over 10,000 fatalities, the majority of which occurred after April. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Vietnam to pay recovered COVID-19 patients to help in hospitals,1988,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam is offering patients who have recovered from the coronavirus a monthly allowance if they agree to stay on at stretched hospitals to help health workers struggling to cope with an influx of infected people. After successfully containing COVID-19 for much of the pandemic, Vietnam is facing its worst outbreak to date driven by the virulent Delta variant, with a surge in cases and deaths ramping up pressure on health authorities. The plan to bring in recovered patients was launched this week in Ho Chi Minh City, which is the epicentre of the current outbreak, accounting for half of the country's nearly 185,000 infections and 7,302 deaths, or about 80% of total fatalities. Working alongside health workers, the role of the former patients in the programme, called ""patient zero with patient zero"", is to support public healthcare services. ""Participants will be provided with personal protective equipment, food, accommodation and a monthly allowance of 8 million dong ($350.80),"" according to a letter reviewed by Reuters that was sent from the head of a hospital taking part of the scheme to recovered COVID-19 patients. The field hospital No.8 treated at least 10,000 patients in July. In recent weeks, Vietnam's health ministry has dispatched 14,600 additional doctors and nurses to the city and its neighbouring provinces to support an overwhelmed medical system. read more ""I don't care much about the allowance, I just want to help burned out healthcare workers,"" Nguyen Hoang Anh, who recovered from the virus a few weeks ago, said by telephone.

Vietnam urges WHO to send more COVID-19 shots as cases surge despite lockdown,3229,"SINGAPORE/HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - While the rapid spread of the Delta variant and low vaccinations have caught much of Asia off-guard, no country shows more vividly than Vietnam how easily the highly infectious version of the coronavirus can foil strict containment policy. Vietnam had successfully contained the coronavirus for most of last year but since April has been dealing with a large COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta. Nearly all of its 370,000 COVID-19 cases have been detected since May and daily infections jumped above 10,000 for the first time this month, overloading hospitals in southern part of the country and raising case fatality rates. ""It is a very good example of a country left behind when all the wealthier countries of the world grabbed the vaccines first,"" said Dale Fisher, a senior infectious disease expert at the National University Hospital in Singapore. ""This disadvantage will only be exacerbated as those same countries engage a precautionary third dose, while countries like Vietnam struggle in single-digit vaccine rates."" Vietnam has fully inoculated just 2% of its 98 million people, among the lowest in Asia, as it opted for containment policy and did not rush to procure vaccines, which it deemed financially too risky due to a severe global shortage. ""If the vaccination rate remains too low not only could Vietnam overtake Indonesia (as the next epicentre) but also be at risk of selecting another variant which is more likely in the unvaccinated population,"" said Roger Lord, a senior medical sciences lecturer at Australian Catholic University. As the Delta variant has upended all assumptions about the virus, Vietnam, a key part of global supply chain for such brands as Samsung (005930.KS) and Nike (NKE.N), is now scrambling to secure more vaccines. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh sent a letter to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday and urged its vaccine sharing programme COVAX to prioritize Vietnam ""in the fastest manner and with the largest volume possible."" Its slow vaccination drive was also impacted by Vietnam's procurement plan, contrasting with many of its neighbours which heavily relied on China for supplies due to limited access to Western shots. Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, has received just around 2.7 million vaccines from China. By contrast, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia, have managed to keep vaccination rates higher by relying on supplies from Beijing. read more At a meeting with Chinh on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador said it would donate 2 million more doses of its vaccines, just a day before the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan to offer 1 million doses of Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech vaccines. read more Amid slow delivery of vaccines, Vietnam has introduced lockdowns and mobilised troops to restrict movements in Ho Chi Minh City, an elimination strategy also adopted by Australia with limited success so far. read more ""When case numbers become very high and presumably due to the Delta variant they (stringent lockdowns) become significantly less effective and make contract tracing very difficult,"" Lord said.

India hurries teacher vaccinations as some physical classes resume,2017,"NEW DELHI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - India will supply millions of additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to its states to try to inoculate all school teachers by early next month, the health minister said on Wednesday, as the country gradually resumes physical classes. The pandemic has hit the country of 1.35 billion people particularly hard and hundreds of millions of its students have been stuck at home for months, with little or no access to online education for a majority of the poor. India last week approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for older children and is trying to urgently immunise all of its nearly 10 million school teachers. The country has been vaccinating its adults since the middle of January. ""We have requested all states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers' Day, which is celebrated on Sept. 5,"" Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Twitter. He said states would be given more than 20 million additional doses for the purpose. Several states have attempted to reopen schools since the pandemic began last year, but some had to shut them down when infections were detected on campuses. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat said it would resume physical classes for middle school students from Sept. 2, at half the capacity, for the first time in more than 18 months. Schools reopened for older children nearly a month ago. A parliamentary report said this month the pandemic disrupted the education of nearly 320 million Indian students in various schools, colleges and universities. It recommended ""accentuated vaccine programmes for all students, teachers and allied staff so that schools may start functioning normally at the earliest"". India has administered 596 million vaccine doses, giving at least one dose to nearly half of its 944 million adults and the required two doses to 14%.

New Zealand pushes ahead with vaccinations as Delta outbreak widens,1789,"WELLINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - New Zealand recorded 62 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of infections in the latest outbreak to 210 as the government scrambled to scale up vaccinations amid growing criticism. Most of the cases are in the largest city Auckland, while 12 are in the capital Wellington, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference. He said 20,383 individual contacts have been identified in the outbreak and there are now over 480 locations of interest. Fortress New Zealand's virus-free run since February ended last week after an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland and quickly spread to Wellington. The outbreak prompted prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a strict level 4 national lockdown. Ardern's reliance on strict border controls and snap lockdowns to eliminate the virus has been called into question amid the latest outbreak, which has occurred while few people have been vaccinated. About 80% of the population has yet to be fully vaccinated. The government said a record 80,000 people were vaccinated on Wednesday and 50,000 others tested. The government defended its elimination strategy, saying it was still the best option for New Zealand. ""It's too soon to throw in the towel. We’ve come this far – it would be an absolute waste for us to give up on this now,"" COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said at a news conference.

"Taiwan reports no new domestic COVID-19 cases, first time since May 9",1425,"TAIPEI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan reported zero new domestic COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the first time since May 9 it has logged no community transmissions, with the pandemic on the democratically ruled island now well under control. The number of COVD-19 cases in Taiwan began climbing in mid-May after months of no or few domestic infections, prompting the government to impose curbs on gatherings, close entertainment venues and stop in-restaurant dining. With the success of those restrictions, as well as ramped up testing and widespread compliance with the rules including mask wearing, those curbs were eased last month. read more Border controls and quarantines for all arrivals have been strengthened.

U.S. VP Harris offers Vietnam support to counter Beijing in the South China Sea,4589,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met Vietnam's top leaders on Wednesday, offering support in several key areas including the enhancement of its maritime security in an effort to counter Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Harris also offered more visits by U.S. warships during her talks with Vietnam's President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, according to a White House official who did not wish to be named. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to woo allies that Washington hopes will help it challenge China's growing security and economic influence in the region. During the talks Harris offered Vietnam vaccines and aid to tackle COVID-19 and announced the launch of several programs to help combat climate change, said the White House official. Speaking in Hanoi, Harris said there was a need to increase pressure on Beijing over its maritime claims. ""We need to find ways to pressure, raise the pressure…on Beijing to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to challenge, its bullying and excessive maritime claims,"" said Harris during a meeting with the Vietnamese president. It was the second time in two days Harris has attacked Beijing. On Tuesday in Singapore, Harris accused Beijing of coercion and intimidation to back unlawful claims in parts of the disputed the South China Sea. China rejected her comments, charging Washington with trying to drive a wedge between Beijing and its Southeast Asian neighbors. read more China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contain gas fields and rich fishing grounds. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the waters. Over the last few years, tensions between China and Vietnam in the South China Sea have remained high and Vietnam has quietly endorsed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy because it takes a hard line against China in the disputed waters. However, with U.S.-China competition throughout the Indo-Pacific dramatically heating up, the Southeast Asian nation has attempted to strike a delicate balancing act. Harris' arrival in Hanoi was delayed on Tuesday after the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam said it had detected an ""anomalous health incident"", potentially related to the mysterious Havana Syndrome. read more During the delay, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China's ambassador to Vietnam held a previously unannounced meeting, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not take sides in foreign policy. The Chinese ambassador told Chinh Beijing would donate 2 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to Vietnam. Senior White House officials have said Harris will strike a balance during her meetings in the region by offering to counter China's influence while not forcing the nations to take sides between the two powers. The U.S. vice president announced support for Vietnam's response to COVID-19 with the donation of an additional one million doses of Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccines, bringing the total donation to the country to 6 million doses, and an additional $23 million to support its efforts to fight the pandemic. After successfully containing the pandemic for much of last year, Vietnam has since April been dealing with a large outbreak of the Delta variant of the virus in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Asia, with just under 2% of its 98 million people fully-vaccinated against COVID-19. MARITIME SECURITY CO-OPERATION The vice president's offer to support Vietnam's increased maritime security included visits by U.S. ships and aircraft carriers, the White House official said. Also contingent on approval from the U.S. Congress, she offered the deployment of a third U.S. Coast Guard high-endurance cutter - a fleet of 24 patrol boats, base facilities, piers, law enforcement training, and other joint activities that helps Vietnam bolster its maritime security, the official said. The U.S. also launched a five-year, $36 million USAID project which aims to accelerate Vietnam's transition to clean energy and announced lower tariffs on U.S. exports of corn, wheat, and pork products to Vietnam to reduce the trade deficit with the country. Harris is also expected to sign a lease for a new U.S. Embassy compound in Hanoi in an effort to expand the relationship between the two countries, the official said.

LPGA Tour cancels Shanghai tournament due to COVID-19,1038,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The LPGA Shanghai tournament has been cancelled due to COVID-19 travel restrictions in China, the elite women's professional golf circuit said on Wednesday. The event, which was scheduled for Oct. 14-17 at the Qizhong Garden Golf Club, did not take place last year because of health concerns and travel restrictions amid the pandemic. According to a Reuters tally, there have been 94,687 infections and 4,636 coronavirus-related deaths reported in China since the pandemic began. American Danielle Kang won the inaugural Shanghai tournament in 2018 and successfully defended her title the following year with a one-stroke win over compatriot Jessica Korda.

Financially isolating Afghanistan is pointless,3883,"MUMBAI, Aug 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A fresh disaster can be averted in Afghanistan, but the international community needs to act fast. The chaotic withdrawal of NATO alliance military forces has been accompanied by abrupt financial disengagement, setting up the country, home to some 38 million people, for failure. Ordinary Afghans depend on a severely distorted economy for their livelihoods. Few countries are as reliant on international funding; about half of the roughly $6 billion budget for 2021 was expected to be financed by grants and borrowings led by foreign agencies, per the World Bank. Now that has halted, and the United States has effectively put most of the country’s $10 billion of central bank foreign exchange reserve out of reach, creating a huge shock. Western officials might not like the radical Islamists in the Taliban, but at the moment someone needs to run the country. Economic upheaval could leave Afghanistan near ungovernable, engendering food shortages, mass unemployment, and hyperinflation, which would in turn fan extremism and exacerbate the refugee crisis. Take deposits. A lot of accounts are held in U.S. dollars, so as Haji Mohammad Idris, the new acting head of the central bank, reopens lenders, he will need to impose strict withdrawal limits on greenbacks. Civil servants can be paid from the stock of local currency, but its plummeting value means it probably won’t buy much. The mess puts development gains made on the back of $145 billion of U.S. reconstruction spending at risk, and could further fuel the illicit drug trade. Multilateral institutions can find ways to prop up basic services while minimising the risk that funds flow to the Taliban. Afghanistan has functioning health and education systems, for example: secondary school enrolment rose from 12% in 2001 to 55% in 2018, per the World Bank, and maternal mortality has fallen. To lead a response, the International Monetary Fund and others need top backers to give them a green light. The Group of Seven rich nations want to use funding as leverage with the militant group on multiple points starting with evacuations, but letting the Afghan economy dissolve will worsen the problems that led to the war in the first place. Follow @ugalani on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Aug. 24 that the Group of Seven rich nations had agreed a plan to deal with the Taliban, with the first condition being that militants must allow safe passage to Afghans wanting to leave the country even after an Aug. 31 deadline. Johnson said the ""huge leverage"" the G7 could wield over the group after they seized control of the country just over a week ago included withholding substantial funds. - “We reaffirm that the Taliban will be held accountable for their actions on preventing terrorism, on human rights in particular those of women, girls and minorities and on pursuing an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan”, the G7 leaders said in a statement. - The Taliban on Aug. 23 appointed Haji Mohammad Idris as acting head of Afghanistan's central bank to help ease growing economic turmoil. He is expected to help organise institutions and address the economic issues facing the population, according to a statement by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Breakingviews

9th Circuit orders do-over in ADA case against college system,4190,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Defusing a potential landmine it planted last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday held that individuals with disabilities can sue over practices that have a discriminatory effect on them even if no discrimination was intended. In a 2-1 split, the panel rejected Los Angeles Community College District’s argument that the Americans with Disabilities Act and its predecessor, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, did not authorize private lawsuits for disparate-impact claims by two former students, the National Federation of the Blind and its California affiliate. Although the panel unanimously overturned the judgment on other grounds and remanded the case for further proceedings, “we consider this a win, for all people with disabilities,” said Joseph Espo of Brown, Goldstein & Levy, which represented plaintiffs Roy Payan, Portia Mason, and the organizations. “The court clearly ruled that there is a private right of action for disparate-impact claims under Title II (of the ADA) and Section 504,” Espo said. The 9th Circuit has long recognized that right, but questioned it last year in an unrelated case – citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision interpreting the 1964 Civil Rights Act – and ordered both LACCD and the plaintiffs to brief the issue. LACCD’s attorney, David Urban of Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, said in an email that they are “evaluating the decision, pleased the Ninth Circuit accepted arguments that LACCD presented, and planning next steps.” The district is “committed to making resources at Los Angeles City College available to blind students,” Urban added. Payan and Mason attended City College, an LACCD school, in 2015 and 2016, and filed suit in 2017 in federal court in Los Angeles. They alleged that LACCD violated federal law and its own policies in numerous ways, such as failing to provide them with accessible assignments and course materials, maintaining an inaccessible website, and purchasing library materials that their screen-reading programs could not access. They included claims for failure to reasonably accommodate their disabilities as well as disparate-impact claims. U.S. District Judge Steven Wilson dismissed the former but ruled that LACCD was liable on the latter. After a 2019 jury trial on damages, Wilson awarded Payan $40,000 and ordered LACCD to remediate its website, evaluate educational technology for accessibility prior to procurement, make its library databases accessible, and designate a Dean of Educational Technology with responsibility for enforcing accessibility policies. On Tuesday, Circuit Judge Richard Tallman said Wilson erred in dismissing the individual accommodation claims and in treating the allegations solely as disparate-impact claims that required systemwide relief. He was joined by Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, dissenting, said ADA Title II and the Rehabilitation Act authorize private suits only for intentional discrimination. In a footnote, the majority mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed last month to consider whether Section 504, as incorporated by the Affordable Care Act, allows ERISA plan participants to bring disparate-impact disability discrimination claims. (Espo and Urban declined to comment on that case, CVS Pharmacy v. Doe.) In a separate nonprecedential memorandum, the 9th Circuit added that Wilson had made evidentiary, procedural, and substantive errors that had harmed both sides, and that the scope of injunctive relief was too broad. The case is Payan et al. v. Los Angeles Community College District, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 19-56111.

(Reuters) - Morrison & Foerster on Tuesday became the latest law firm to bulk up its life sciences and healthcare team, adding Palo Alto-based partner Hogene Choi to its patent strategy and prosecution group. Choi, who has a computer science background and experience in data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, leaves Baker Botts, where she served as co-chair of the patent counseling and strategic portfolio development practice group. She works with life sciences, healthcare and technology industry clients, according to the firm. Firms have been scooping up lawyers with life sciences and healthcare experience over the past 18 months in response to increased demand from clients in a variety of practice areas, including for corporate transactions, technology, regulatory and intellectual property expertise. Several other firms in the past year have made moves to hire IP lawyers with life sciences industry experience, including Cooley, White & Case, Barnes & Thornburg and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. San Francisco-founded Morrison & Foerster recently hired other life sciences and technology lawyers, including Stacy Cline Amin, former chief counsel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who joined as a partner and co-lead of the firm's FDA regulatory and compliance practice in June. The firm lost a life sciences dealmaker in July to Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. Michael Ward, head of the firm's life sciences and healthcare and patent practices, in a statement described Choi's computer science, patent prosecution, litigation and technology expertise as ""tremendous assets"" that ""align perfectly with the areas where we are seeing extraordinary client demand across our global offices."" Choi said in an interview on Tuesday that she was drawn to the firm because of its life sciences platform and its ""well-known culture of collaboration."" She also noted that she previously worked with Mark Whitaker, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's IP litigation group. Whitaker joined the firm from Baker Botts in 2016. Many life sciences companies have software-related needs, including using AI and machine learning to speed up research and development efforts, and using ""basic software"" in medical devices to improve benefits to patients, Choi said. The use of technology is an ""exploding area of the industry,"" she said.

Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies after tour pull out,5601,"LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, widely regarded as one of the coolest men in rock, a jazz enthusiast and a snappy dresser, died on Tuesday just three weeks after pulling out of the band's upcoming U.S. tour for health reasons. He was 80 years old. ""It is with immense sadness that we announce the death of our beloved Charlie Watts. He passed away peacefully in a London hospital earlier today surrounded by his family,"" Watts' spokesperson said in a statement. Among the first British bands to properly crack the American market and a symbol of 1960s London, the Rolling Stones lineup of Watts, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones and Bill Wyman produced a string of hit records. The Stones also went on to break records with multimillion-pound grossing global tours. Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr described Watts as a ""beautiful human being"" and said he was shocked by Watts' death. ""I knew he wasn't doing well, but it was a shock to me,"" Starr, who joined the Beatles in August 1962, five months before Watts became a member of the Rolling Stones, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview after Watts' death. Watts played drums on all of the group's 30 albums and on every tour. No cause of death was given for his passing, but the announcement followed an Aug. 4 statement by the band that the drummer was pulling out of its rescheduled No Filter U.S. tour because he needed time to recuperate after an unspecified emergency medical procedure. Bandmates had expected Watts to rejoin the band. ""We really look forward to welcoming Charlie back as soon as he is fully recovered,"" Jagger tweeted on Aug. 4. After the death of Watts was announced, Jagger tweeted an image of the joyful drummer while Keith Richards posted a photo of a drum set without adding any words. Disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the No Filter tour is scheduled to kick off on Sept. 26 in St. Louis. There was no word on Tuesday whether it would go ahead. The death of Watts brought tributes from musicians ranging from Paul McCartney to country singer Rosanne Cash. ""Charlie Watts was the ultimate drummer,"" Elton John posted on Twitter. ""The most stylish of men, and such brilliant company. McCartney sent condolences in a video message. ""I knew he was ill but I didn't know he was this ill... It's a huge blow to them because Charlie was a rock and a fantastic drummer."" Watts was born in 1941 during World War Two and grew up in the Wembley area of northwest London, attending Harrow school of Art before starting work as a graphic artist with an advertising agency.

REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File Photo Unlike his bandmates, Watts had been in a successful group before agreeing to join the Rolling Stones in 1963. He married Shirley Ann Shepherd in 1964 and they remained together until his death - the first regular member of the band to pass away since Jones in 1969. While holding down the day job, Watts played in the evenings with Blues Incorporated led by Alexis Korner, alongside future Cream bassist Jack Bruce. He was replaced by future Cream drummer Ginger Baker when he left. He played his first gig with the Stones at the Ealing Blues Club in West London with the six piece band that included pianist Ian Stewart, Wyman on bass and Jones on guitar. Watts left the hell-raising that defined the Stones in the 1960s and '70s to the other members, but provided the heartbeat of the band, and with Wyman was considered one of the great rock rhythm sections. Away from the Rolling Stones, Watts found the time to play jazz with several groups including a 32-piece band, the Charlie Watts Orchestra, as well as to work with pianist Stewart in the band Rocket 88 during the 1980s. In the 1990s, the Charlie Watts Quintet released several albums, including a tribute to jazz great Charlie Parker. In 2004, the quintet expanded to become Charlie Watts and the Tentet. 'DIDN'T SUIT ME AT ALL' While his bandmates entertained groupies on an epic scale, Watts indulged instead - he once told a radio interviewer - in a compulsive habit of sketching every new hotel room he occupied. He did speak of a short period in the 1980s when he tried to deal with a mid-life crisis by bingeing on drink and drugs. ""It was very short for me. I just stopped, it didn’t suit me at all,"" he told the Daily Mirror newspaper in 2012. ""I drank too much and took drugs. I went mad really. But I stopped it all. It was very easy for me."" In 2004, he was diagnosed with throat cancer after having quit smoking in the late 1980s, and underwent radiation therapy. The cancer went into remission, and he returned to recording and touring with the Stones. Despite newspaper accounts of a drunken spat with Jagger in the 1980s over whether the singer or the drummer was more important to a group, Watts was in a magnanimous mood when he spoke to the Guardian newspaper in 2013. ""Mick is the show, really, we back him,"" he said, adding however, ""but Mick wouldn’t dance well if the sound was bad."" Watts was always known as a keen shopper and a snappy dresser. The Daily Telegraph once named him one of the World's Best Dressed Men and in 2006 Vanity Fair inducted him into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. ""It's supposed to be sex and drugs and rock and roll,"" he once said. ""I'm not really like that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Goldman Sachs to mandate COVID vaccine for staff, visitors at U.S. offices -memo",1757,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) told employees that from Tuesday anyone entering its offices in the United States must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The bank will also require that masks be worn in offices regardless of vaccination status from Wednesday, while fully vaccinated employees will receive weekly COVID-19 tests starting on Sept. 7, the memo said. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. The announcement comes a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, a certification that public health officials hope will convince unvaccinated Americans that the shot is safe and effective. read more In June, Goldman was one of the earliest Wall Street banks to require that most employees return to offices, and the vaccine mandate is part of the effort to continue working at offices safely amid a resurgence in COVID cases. Goldman's new policy is in line with rival banks Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), which also require vaccines at their U.S. headquarters. Three of the four largest U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) - do not require vaccines for individuals at their offices.

U.S. could control COVID by spring 2022 if more people get shots -Fauci,3732,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The United States could get COVID-19 under control by early next year if vaccinations ramp up, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday, one day after Pfizer (PFE.N) won fuller FDA approval for its shot, with more potential approvals coming in the weeks ahead. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in multiple television interviews and a White House press conference that full Food and Drug Administration approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine paves the way for more people to get inoculated, with potential approval for Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) in the coming weeks and authorization for younger children by autumn. ""I would like to appeal to the people in the country who are not vaccinated to realize that we have the capability, among ourselves, to essentially cut down the time frame to getting to the end of this pandemic,"" Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a Tuesday press conference. ""I think there's a reasonable chance"" that Pfizer or Moderna could get FDA clearance for children under 12 before the upcoming holiday season, he told NBC News. ""Hopefully by the mid-late fall and early winter."" U.S. officials during the Tuesday press briefing also urged private employers and more state and local governments to require staff to get vaccinated in a bid to drive up vaccination rates. ""Now is the time"" for U.S. employers to start mandating vaccinations, White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zients said, echoing remarks from President Joe Biden on Monday. Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci responds to accusations by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as he testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Capitol hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 20, 2021. J. Scott Applewhite/Pool via REUTERS Meanwhile, the White House is preparing to provide third ""booster"" doses starting in mid-September to Americans who received their COVID-19 inoculation more than eight months ago. The plan depends upon a thumbs up from the FDA and an advisory panel to the CDC. read more ""We want to make sure we stay ahead of the virus,"" Zients said, adding that ""the plan is pending the FDA conducting an independent evaluation and outside experts... issuing a booster dose recommendation."" Fauci added that healthcare providers should also make more use of COVID-19 antibody treatments, including those from Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O), and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L)/Vir Biotechnology Inc (VIR.O). Such treatments can reduce hospitalizations and deaths by as much as 85% if used early in infected people, he said. The United States is battling another wave of cases due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, particularly in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and other parts of the U.S. South. The average number of deaths from COVID-19 has risen by 23% over the previous seven-day period, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during a Tuesday press call. The United States is now averaging 1,000 COVID deaths a day and over 150,000 new cases, according to a Reuters tally. U.S. health officials have also noted the number of inoculations has also risen in recent weeks and say they hope Monday's FDA action spurs more people get their first shots. The U.S. military, along with several businesses and universities, including CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), privately held Deloitte and at least one college football team, have moved ahead with COVID vaccine mandates since the FDA's announcement, which also buoyed Wall Street.

Judge 'struggling' with talc plaintiffs' bid to block J&J asset maneuvering,4730,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Delaware bankruptcy judge said on Tuesday that she was uncertain about a bid by individuals with talc-related personal injury claims to block Johnson & Johnson from taking steps that they believe could shift valuable assets out of their reach. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein in Wilmington, Delaware made her comments during a virtual hearing over a group of talc claimants’ motion in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of J&J's former talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, to enjoin J&J from pursuing a transaction that would separate its talc-related liabilities from its assets. The individuals seeking the injunction hold personal injury claims against Imerys, which is pursuing a reorganization plan that would set up a trust to compensate personal injury claimants and is seeking indemnification from J&J to fund the trust. J&J’s alleged indemnification obligations, which it disputes, stem from a series of supply agreements between the two companies. J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging baby powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe. Imerys was named as a co-defendant in many talc-related lawsuits and ultimately filed for bankruptcy to address the litigation in 2019. Reuters reported in July that J&J is considering a plan to separate liabilities from talc-related litigation into a newly-created entity that would then be placed in bankruptcy. The healthcare conglomerate could do so under the Texas “divisive merger” law that allows a company to split into more than one entity. J&J has neither confirmed nor denied whether it intends to pursue the divisive merger. A lawyer for the talc claimants, Natalie Ramsey of Robinson & Cole, argued that the transaction, if it were to occur, would violate the automatic stay protecting entities in bankruptcy against efforts to collect on debts owed or seize the debtors’ assets. Silverstein said she was “struggling” with the situation and would need a few days to issue a ruling. “I’m having some trouble wrapping my head around this as [an automatic stay] violation as opposed to perhaps something else,” the judge said. Ramsey told the judge that Imerys’s right to indemnification under its contract with J&J is a property right. An effort to separate J&J’s talc liabilities from its valuable assets and place the entity with the talc-liabilities into bankruptcy would impair its ability to satisfy those indemnification obligations, and thereby impair Imerys’s property rights, she said. “It would be like taking the debtors’ sports car and bringing back a beat-up jalopy,” she said. Ramsey argued that such a transaction would be a “targeted act” aimed at controlling Imerys property and therefore constitute a violation of the automatic stay. She urged the judge to reject J&J’s contention that barring it from moving forward with a divisive merger would interfere with its normal corporate operations. Theodore Tsekerides of Weil Gotshal & Manges, representing J&J, said the plaintiffs are trying to enjoin the company from using legal restructuring tools. The plaintiffs haven’t shown that this type of transaction by J&J would cause harm, he added. “Charitably, the motion is a hot mess,” he said. Separately, a group of cancer victims filed papers in a Missouri state court on Tuesday aiming to block J&J from placing its talc-related liabilities into bankruptcy.

Explainer: What happens after Biden's evacuation force leaves Afghanistan?,4718,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday stuck by his plan to remove the nearly 6,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of August, contingent on whether the Taliban cooperates to allow the evacuation of more Americans and their Afghan allies. read more Biden announced a plan in April to withdraw 2,500 U.S. troops who were still in Afghanistan after a 20-year war, but was forced to send thousands more back to evacuate those at risk as the U.S.-backed government and military quickly collapsed. The chaotic and perilous evacuation from Kabul airport that ensued has unleashed a wave of criticism and presented Biden with his biggest crisis since taking office in January. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? U.S. officials say the troop withdrawal must begin no later than Friday to be completed by Aug. 31 and it will take several days. The troops at Kabul airport include Marines and paratroopers. As they pack up their equipment and withdraw, the pace of evacuations by U.S. and allied forces - which reached 20,000 a day this week - will inevitably slow. HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN BE EVACUATED BY THE DEADLINE? Since Aug. 14, more than 70,000 people, including American citizens, NATO personnel and Afghans at risk, have been evacuated from Kabul, Biden said on Tuesday. Biden has said the United States will evacuate any U.S. citizen who wants to leave and officials have said they will evacuate as many at-risk Afghans as possible. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Pentagon believes it has the ability to get all Americans who want to leave out by Aug. 31 and U.S. officials say 4,000 Americans have been evacuated so far, but they do not know how many are still in the country, as not all registered with the U.S. embassy. The Pentagon has also committed to evacuate the roughly 500 Afghan soldiers who have been helping to protect Kabul airport. Despite the current pace of evacuation, which has involved dozens of military transport planes from the United States and around the world, many thousands of Afghans who officials and advocacy groups say face potential retribution at the hands of the Taliban, will not be able to leave by Biden's deadline. WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND? The Association of Wartime Allies, a refugee resettlement group, estimates 250,000 Afghans, including interpreters and drivers and other workers who helped the U.S. effort, need to be evacuated, but only 62,000 have left since July. The State Department says the aim is to help at-risk Afghans leave even after the troop withdrawal and that Washington will put pressure on the Taliban to ensure they are able to do so. ""What does not end when the military mission ends is our commitment to at-risk Afghans,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We will hold the Taliban to this; the rest of the world will as well – that individuals who seek to leave after the U.S. military is gone will have an opportunity to do so."" WHAT LEVERAGE DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE? One of the biggest questions the Biden administration and like-minded governments face is whether to recognize the government the Taliban establishes. This would have important consequences, including as to whether the Taliban will have access to the foreign aid relied upon by previous Afghan governments. A 2020 agreement signed by the former Trump administration explicitly states that the Taliban ""is not recognized by the United States as a state,"" but there are already signs Washington will have to talk to the Islamist militant group on some issues, such as counter-terrorism. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday in the highest level official encounter since the group took over Kabul on Aug. 15. U.S. officials say the Taliban opposes groups like Islamic State and U.S. diplomats and commanders have been in contact with Taliban officials throughout the evacuation. WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS? The United States, its allies and the United Nations will have to decide how to deal with a looming humanitarian disaster. The U.N. says more than 18 million people - over half Afghanistan's population - require aid and half of all Afghan children under the age of five already suffer from acute malnutrition amid the second drought in four years. The World Health Organization says it has only enough supplies in Afghanistan to last a week after deliveries were blocked by restrictions at Kabul airport and it is concerned the upheaval will push up coronavirus infections. The Taliban have assured the U.N. it can pursue humanitarian work, but the world body will insist on women's rights and access to all civilians. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. COVID-19 vaccine approval is 'seismic' shift for legality of mandates, experts say",3753,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Formal U.S approval of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine will make it nearly impossible to successfully challenge mandates by employers, legal experts said. The decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give full approval to the vaccine is ""seismic,"" said Brian Dean Abramson, an author on vaccine law. He said it will become extremely difficult to challenge the FDA's decision and the mandates that flow from it. On Monday, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine became the first to secure full FDA validation, prompting calls for governments and private employers to make the shots mandatory. COVID-19 vaccines have been available in the United States since December under the an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA. Language in the EUA law states that recipients must be informed of benefits and risks of the vaccine and given the option to accept or refuse it. That language raised some uncertainty regarding employer mandates, which are usually considered legal, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings Law. ""With full approval, that is removed."" Following the FDA announcement on Monday, CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) - the second-largest U.S. oil producer - and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) issued mandates for some employees. Legal experts said there already was a growing consensus that employers could mandate an emergency vaccine. During the pandemic, both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice issued guidance in support of vaccine mandates, provided exceptions were made for medical conditions and religious beliefs. But emergency vaccine requirements have not gone unchallenged. At least a dozen lawsuits have been filed, mostly by students against colleges, but also by employees fighting allegations of wrongful termination for refusing a shot. Most of the cases prominently feature arguments that vaccines approved on an emergency basis could not be required, seizing on language in the emergency authorization law that requires consent from the vaccine recipient. Isaac Legaretta, for example, said he was never told he could refuse the vaccine required by the Dona Ana Detention Center in New Mexico where he worked. ""Quite the opposite, he was advised that he would be fired if he did so,"" said the Legaretta lawsuit, which was filed in February and is pending. In July, in one of the few rulings involving a private employer, a federal judge in Texas upheld vaccine mandates for employees at a Houston Methodist Hospital, finding the employees misunderstood the language in the EUA law. Legal experts said challenges to vaccine mandates will almost certainly persist, particularly against public employers or public universities and colleges, which involve allegations of governments infringing on an individual's Constitutional rights. That argument does not apply to private employers. But as long as the government is requiring the vaccine as a condition of employment or education, legal experts said those will be difficult cases to make. ""You can always go work for somebody else or go to a school that doesn't require a vaccine,"" said Jeffrey Nolan, an attorney with Holland & Knight, which represents employers. Many employers have tried to use incentives such as gift cards and time off to encourage vaccinations. That approach seems to have run its course, legal experts said. With full FDA approval, employers appear ready to move toward ordering staff to get vaccinated. Samantha Monsees, an attorney with Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said: ""I think based on my workload in the last two days the FDA approval is going to tip the scales with a lot of employers.""

"Meme stocks soar in late day trading surge, short sellers knocked",2532,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Shares of several retail trading darlings, including AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) and GameStop (GME.N), surged in heavy volume late on Tuesday, on no apparent news, dealing over $1 billion in losses to short sellers. While broad market indexes rose modestly on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq (.IXIC) up 0.5% and the S&P 500 (.SPX) 0.1% higher, several of the ""meme stocks"" notched big gains. GameStop shares jumped 27.53%, AMC shares climbed 20.3%, Clover Health Investments (CLOV.O) rose 9.9%, Koss Corp (KOSS.O) rose 4.4%, Robinhood Markets climbed (HOOD.O) 9.0% and ContextLogic (WISH.O) rose 6.4%. ""When you get a move that big it almost makes you think there is some big hedge fund or something out there that decided to do some trades,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research. Frederick, however, said he had seen little in the way of news to spur the large share price moves on Tuesday. The jump in the share price on Tuesday also dealt large losses to investors with bearish bets on some of these stocks, according to analytics company ORTEX. ""Heavily shorted stocks have, for the last month, been less volatile than earlier this year. Today we saw an end to this,"" said Ortex co-founder Peter Hillerberg. The share price gains in AMC and GameStop generated losses for close to $1 billion for short sellers, Hillerberg said. Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. Several of these stocks also drew higher-than-usual trading volume in the options market on Tuesday, as traders jockeyed to either take advantage of the rallying prices or moved to cover positions that were under water. For instance, GameStop options trading volume was at 407,000 contracts, or about six times its recent average daily trading volume, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. AMC options volume came in at 1.6 million contracts, nearly three times its daily average, making it the most active single stock name in the options market on Tuesday, Trade Alert data showed. While the retail trading frenzy that had taken Wall Street by storm earlier this year has subsided somewhat in recent months, the periodic wild moves in the share prices has kept investors on their toes, analysts said. ""Options prices are implying that this is not going away any time soon,"" said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Diabetes surges among American youth, study shows",2953,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The number of young people with the most prevalent form of diabetes nearly doubled in the United States from 2001 to 2017, according to a study published on Tuesday. The findings showed that the rate of young people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes increased by 95% over the 16-year period. The estimated rate of youth under age 20 with type 1 diabetes grew by 45%. ""Rising rates of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, which is preventable, has the potential to create a cascade of poor health outcomes,"" said Dr Giuseppina Imperatore, who oversees disease surveillance and other areas at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Diabetes Translation. This month, Reuters published a special report on the worsening outcomes for people with diabetes in the United States. The new findings come from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, which was funded by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). One in 10 Americans, or 34 million people, have diabetes in the United States. About 1.6 million people have type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease of unknown cause that requires insulin injections when the pancreas stops producing the hormone. Millions more have type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition in which the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use it well. Researchers found significant increases in diabetes among both sexes and across racial and ethnic groups. Type 1 diabetes remains more common among white youth. Larger increases in type 2 prevalence were found among young people who are Black or Hispanic, according to the study published in JAMA. The highest rates of type 2 diabetes were seen in youth who are Black or Native American. Jean M. Lawrence, the paper's lead author and director of the NIH's diabetes epidemiology program, said more research is needed to better understand what's driving these increases. ""Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes could be caused by rising rates of childhood obesity, in-utero exposure to maternal obesity and diabetes, or increased diabetes screenings,"" Lawrence said. The COVID-19 pandemic also hit people with diabetes particularly hard, including those who never got sick from the virus but fell victim to the isolation and disruption it caused. Reuters in the Special Report found that deaths from diabetes last year surged 17% to more than 100,000. Younger people, those ages 25 to 44, suffered the sharpest increase, with a 29% jump in deaths. By comparison, all other deaths except those directly attributed to the coronavirus rose 6% last year, Reuters found. Also on Tuesday, a U.S. government-backed panel of experts in disease prevention recommended that overweight or obese adults should be screened for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes starting at age 35, lowering the age by five years.

"NRA gun lobby cancels annual U.S. meeting, citing COVID-19 surge",2412,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association (NRA) said on Tuesday it has canceled its upcoming annual convention, which was set to open late next week in Houston, citing public health concerns posed by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. The announcement came amid court action brought by New York state Attorney General Letitia James seeking to dissolve the NRA, accusing the nation's leading firearms lobby of failing to root out rampant internal corruption. read more The NRA's yearly Meeting & Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the country, primarily members of the gun rights organization, to several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms displays. The 2021 event had been scheduled to run from Sept. 3 through Sept. 5 at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. But the beleaguered organization said in a statement it had decided to indefinitely postpone the annual meeting ""after analyzing relevant data regarding COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas,"" which encompasses the city of Houston. Texas, like much of the United States, has seen COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths climb sharply in recent weeks as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus spread swiftly through the population, especially among the unvaccinated. ""The NRA's top priority is ensuring the health and well-being of our members, staff, sponsors and supporters,"" the group said in its statement. ""We are mindful that NRA annual meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications."" The NRA, embroiled in allegations of graft and mismanagement, had sought to use Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reincorporate in Republican-dominated Texas and escape what it called a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York, where it was founded in 1871. But a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas dismissed the Chapter 11 filing in May, calling it an improper effort to avoid the lawsuit brought by James. In an amended complaint filed last week, James said the NRA's concealment of millions of dollars in questionable transactions, awarding perks to longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre and other insiders, had ""continued unabated"" since she first sued the nonprofit last August.

"High blood pressure driven by obesity, poverty - WHO study",1928,"GENEVA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Nearly 1.3 billion people globally suffer from hypertension, a silent killer often driven by obesity that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. Hypertension can be easily diagnosed by monitoring blood pressure, and treated with low-cost drugs, but half of affected people are unaware of their condition which is left untreated, the WHO and Imperial College London said in a joint study published in The Lancet. While hypertension rates have changed little in 30 years, the caseload has shifted to lower-income countries as wealthy nations have brought it largely under control, the study said. ""It is far from being a condition of affluence, it's very much a condition of poverty,"" Majid Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College London, told a news briefing. ""Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia, some of the Pacific island nations, they are still not getting the treatments that are needed,"" he said. Some 17.9 million people died in 2019 from cardiovascular diseases, accounting for one in three global deaths, with hypertension a major factor, according to the WHO. ""We know that the treatment is cheap, it's low cost medicines. But there is a need to include them in the UHC (universal health coverage) so this is not a cost for the patient, it has to be covered by the insurance system,"" said Bente Mikkelsen, director of the WHO's department of noncommunicable diseases. Apart from genetic risk factors for hypertension, there are ""modifiable risk factors"" linked to lifestyle, Mikkelsen said. These include unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes, and being overweight, she said. Referring to obesity, she said: ""This is really the tsunami of the risk factors"". Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It also plans to cancel the Sept. 4 ""Disney Fantasy"" sailing. Disney's cruise line had earlier said it did not insist on vaccinations, but the change in stance comes after the U.S. health regulator asked people at a high risk of severe COVID-19 illness to avoid cruises irrespective of vaccination status. read more The Bahamas, a major hub for cruises, has also said it would not allow those ships to dock in the country unless all passengers 12 and older provide proof of vaccination.

FTC urges judge to unwind $7.1 bln Illumina-Grail merger,2776,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it seeks to unwind life science company Illumina Inc's (ILMN.O) $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc (GRAL.O), alleging it would harm innovation and boost prices. FTC senior counsel Susan Musser said in her opening statement at a trial in Washington that cancer test-detection company Grail and its competitors rely on San Diego, California-based Illumina's DNA sequencing technology. She argued that Illumina's purchase of Grail would give the company the ""incentive and ability to foreclose downstream rivals."" Antitrust lawyers are closely tracking the FTC trial as a rare enforcement action against a ""vertical"" merger in which two companies are not direct competitors. The FTC's witnesses are expected to include representatives from other companies competing with Grail. ""Evidence will show that the war on cancer, if it is to be won, will be won by competition, not by this acquisition,"" Musser said. Grail is in an ""innovation race"" to develop and market its early-detection test, she added, and Illumina would have the power to ""anoint"" Grail the winner if the deal is not canceled. Illumina, founded in 1998, owned Grail but spun it off in 2016 while retaining a 12% ownership stake. Illumina and Grail closed their merger last week, saying no legal barrier blocked the deal. European antitrust regulators said on Friday they ""deeply regret"" the closure prior to regulatory approval. Illumina's attorney, David Marriott of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said in his opening statement that the ""reunion"" of Illumina and Grail would accelerate the development and adoption of an early cancer-detection product. ""The FTC's theory asks the court to forego the life-saving benefits of this transaction to avoid the potential harm that could not possibly occur for years - that could only occur, we submit, if other tests actually in fact ultimately are developed,"" Marriott said. He said the FTC theory ""needlessly gambles with human lives."" A lawyer for Grail said at trial that the company's merger with Illumina will provide the fastest way toward ""widespread commercial acceptance"" of its multi-cancer early detection test, which relies on a blood draw. The case is In the Matter of Illumina Inc and Grail Inc, Federal Trade Commission Office of Administrative Law Judges, Docket No. 9401.

CVS Health mandates full COVID-19 vaccination for some employees,1463,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Health conglomerate CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) has mandated complete COVID-19 vaccination for its nurses, pharmacists and other employees who face patients, joining a string of U.S. firms seeking to slow the spread of the contagious Delta coronavirus variant. The policy, announced on Monday, comes after the U.S. health regulator granted full authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE . read more The approval is expected to spur a string of similar mandates from corporate employers. CVS said it would require all corporate staff to get fully vaccinated by October end and had asked recently hired employees to get their first COVID-19 shot before joining work. The company, which operates one of the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, had said earlier this month that employees at its worksites were required to wear masks or face covers, regardless of their vaccination status. Pharmacists at its retail stores will have until Nov. 30 to get fully vaccinated, the company had added. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) has said it is requiring staff at support offices to be fully vaccinated. read more U.S. energy companies have already moved to require that employees receive vaccinations amid rising infection rates at home, with health surveys showing that energy workers remain among those most reluctant to get shots. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Missouri attorney general sues school districts that mandate masks,2006,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against school districts in his state that have required masks for students and teachers, calling the practice in a statement ""arbitrary and capricious."" The lawsuit filed in Boone County Circuit Court named Columbia Public Schools, its school board and its superintendent as defendants but also includes other schools that have issued such mandates. Columbia's school district, with about 19,000 pupils in the center of the Midwestern state, issued a mask mandate this month for all students, teachers and staff to protect against a surge in COVID-19 cases. ""We filed this suit today because we fundamentally don’t believe in forced masking, rather that parents and families should have the power to make decisions on masks, based on science and facts,"" Schmitt said in a statement. The lawsuit asked the court to rule the mask mandate is unlawful and to block the district from carrying it out. The lawsuit is one of several court battles being waged in the United States over masking and COVID vaccinations as educators, parents and lawmakers grapple with another coronavirus surge just as students head back to the classroom. In Florida, the state Board of Education on Friday ordered two school districts to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that their children wear masks or face having some of their state funding withheld. On Tuesday, the Broward County School Board, which oversees a system of 261,000 students, said it rejected the order. Columbia Public Schools officials were not available for comment on Tuesday. On Aug. 13, when the district announced the masking requirement, it cited a high rate of transmission of the Delta variant in the community.

U.S. VP Harris forges on with Vietnam trip despite mystery 'health incident',3735,"HANOI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris pushed ahead with a trip to Vietnam on Tuesday after delaying the visit over concerns due to a health incident potentially related to the mysterious Havana syndrome. Harris arrived in the Southeast Asian country's capital after a three-hour delay in Singapore that the U.S. government blamed on reports that someone in Hanoi may have been targeted by the Havana syndrome, a condition of unknown origin with symptoms including dizziness, nausea, migraines and memory lapses. The incident upstaged a bid by President Joe Biden's top deputy to woo the allies Washington hopes will help it challenge China's assertive foreign policy in the region. Beijing, meanwhile, attempted to stage its own diplomatic coup with a surprise meeting in Vietnam and a donation of 2 million COVID-19 vaccines to the country. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Havana syndrome case was reported in Vietnam before Harris' departure but not confirmed. A safety assessment was done before sending Harris to the country, she said. ""The Vice President's office was made aware of a report of a recent possible anomalous health incident in Hanoi,"" the local U.S. Embassy said. Some 200 U.S. officials and kin, including CIA officers, have been sickened by ""Havana syndrome,"" CIA Director William Burns has said. A U.S. National Academy of Sciences panel in December found that a plausible theory is that ""directed energy"" beams caused the syndrome, which is so named because it first was reported by American officials based in the U.S. embassy in Cuba in 2016. The CIA sees a ""very strong possibility"" that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, but is withholding definitive conclusions pending further investigation. Moscow denies involvement. VIETNAM SAYS IT PICKS NO SIDES The incident came as Washington faces icy relations with another global competitor, China. As Harris's trip to Vietnam was delayed, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh held the unannounced meeting with Chinese Ambassador Xiong Bo, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not align itself with one country against any other. Earlier on Tuesday, Harris had accused Beijing of coercion and intimidation to back claims in the South China Sea, her most pointed comments on China during a visit to Southeast Asia, a region she said is critical to U.S. security. ""The Prime Minister affirmed that Vietnam adheres to an independent, self-reliant, multilateral, and diverse foreign policy and is a responsible member of the international community,"" the Vietnamese government said in a statement. ""Vietnam does not align itself with one country against another,"" it said. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be settled according to international law and ""high-level common sense,"" it said. The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century. ""The fact that China's ambassador insisted on a meeting with the Vietnamese prime minister shortly before Harris landed shows how anxious Beijing is that its communist neighbor may tilt toward the U.S.,"" said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. During the meeting, Chinh thanked the ambassador for the vaccine donation. It was not immediately clear which vaccine China had donated. Vietnam had successfully contained the coronavirus for most of last year but since April has been dealing with a large COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. Just under 2% of its 98 million people are fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Philippines' Duterte raises rivals' suspicions by seeking vice presidency in 2022,3505,"MANILA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Tuesday he will run for the vice presidency in next year's elections, confirming an earlier announcement by the country's ruling political party that was criticized by opponents as a ploy for Duterte to maintain his grip on power. The announcement came ahead of the party's national convention on Sept. 8, where it is also expected to endorse Duterte's aide and incumbent senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go to be its presidential candidate in the 2022 polls. ""I will run as vice president, then I will continue the crusade. Number one is insurgency, then criminality, drugs,"" Duterte said in a late night weekly national address. ""I may not have the power to give the direction or guidance but I can always express my views in public."" Under the constitution, a president can serve only one term, and the announcement had been widely anticipated as Duterte had already hinted he could seek the No. 2 job, a move seen by political observers and critics as a backdoor to the presidency. read more Duterte was heeding ""the clamour of the people,"" Karlo Nograles, executive vice president of the PDP-Laban party, said in a statement. Critics believe he could be making a play for retaining power by taking over as president under a scenario in which Go wins and then resigns, enabling Duterte to shield himself from possible legal actions when he leaves office. read more ""This is really part of the scheme of the Duterte clique to extend not only influence but control of government,"" said opposition congressman Carlos Zarate. Duterte-backer Nograles said the move would ""guarantee continuity of the administration's programmes during the past five years,"" including his war on drugs, which an International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor wants investigated. read more Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, has described as ""unfounded and illogical"" claims that he would control the office of the president should he clinch the vice presidency. Opinion polls show Duterte remains hugely popular, despite his bloody anti-drugs campaign and criticism of the pandemic response, but analysts say his popularity would not necessarily rub off on Go. In the Philippines, the president is elected separately from the vice president. Duterte has previously said he wanted Go to be his successor. His endorsement in 2019 helped Go to become a senator, a post he carries out alongside his duties as Duterte's personal aide. ""In choosing his successor, President Duterte is grappling with an unstated urgent concern: who can be best trusted to protect and insulate him from almost certain criminal suits once he is out of power,"" said think tank the Center for People Empowerment Governance. Go has been the 76-year-old president's closest aide since the late 1990s, when Duterte was a congressman representing his hometown Davao City. Previously, Go has insisted he is not interested in the presidency. ""Vaccines first, before politics,"" Go, who chairs the senate committee on health, told Reuters. Duterte's daughter, Davao City mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, has outshone Go in opinion polls, but she and her father have played down the prospect of her running. Political analyst Victor Manhit said until candidacies were officially filed, starting in October, everything is speculation, with opinion polls showing other vice presidential candidates including a Manila mayor just behind Duterte.

"Greece to end free COVID-19 tests for unvaccinated, infections hit new record",1960,"ATHENS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Greece said on Tuesday it would end free testing for unvaccinated people to encourage them to get inoculated and head off any renewed spike in Delta variant infections of the coronavirus. Health authorities reported 4,608 new confirmed cases and 32 related deaths on Tuesday, with the daily tally of infections hitting a new record, surpassing 4,340 cases in March this year. The country has recorded a total of 566,812 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and 13,466 deaths since reporting its first COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020. Health authorities said that only 27 cases in Tuesday's infection tally were ""imported"", meaning they were detected after checks at border entry points. New measures to come into effect on Sept. 13 stop short of forcing people to take a jab, but end free testing and oblige unvaccinated persons to test either once or twice a week, depending on their profession. The costs of the rapid test, set at 10 euros ($12), is a sizeable chunk of money for people in crisis-hit Greece where salaries average 1,161 euros ($1,363.48) a month. Authorities said some six million people in the country of 11 million had already received one or two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, but that a million more were needed to build adequate immunity through the population. ""In contrast to autumn of last year, this autumn everyone can be vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias. ""Do we live, or play Russian roulette with the coronavirus?"" Free testing for vaccinated people will continue, he said. ""These measures are not punitive. They are our duty to all those who went through 18 months of the pandemic carefully, those who lost their shops, jobs, had to work from home to protect themselves."" About 53 percent of the Greek population is fully vaccinated. Authorities hope to increase that figure to 70 percent by the autumn.

California to boost solar and wind capacity to meet renewable goals,1754,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region plans to increase its solar and wind power capacity in 2021 to help meet the state's target of 50% renewable generation by 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday. The CAISO plans to add an additional 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity and 0.4 GW of onshore wind turbine capacity this year, the EIA said in a release. CAISO is also planning to add 2.5 GW of battery storage capacity this year, the EIA said. These batteries could be charged using renewable power generation that would otherwise have been curtailed, it added. Additionally, two projects are being developed to facilitate hydrogen production and hydrogen-based energy storage, which could also help reduce curtailments of excess solar output. Excess supply from renewable sources has prompted the grid to increasingly curtail solar and wind generation at times, even as it struggles to balance its clean energy push with the need to boost tight power supplies and avoid rolling blackouts amid heatwaves. California said earlier this month it would lean more on fossil fuels in coming weeks to keep the power on if scorching heatwaves stretch its grid, demonstrating the challenges grids face by relying more on large amounts of wind and solar energy that only run when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. read more Other Top Sustainable Business stories Deutsche fund arm faces US probe over sustainable investments Breakingviews: Maersk’s green ships have first-mover disadvantage Dust at BHP's iron ore mines poses health hazard-union Denmark, Costa Rica seek alliance to speed up the end of oil and gas Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SEC fines Healthcare Services Group for concealing legal settlements, inflating earnings",1760,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Healthcare Services Group Inc (HCSG.O) willpay a $6 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that its failure to account for legal settlements with its employees enabled it to inflate quarterly results, the regulator said on Tuesday. The SEC said the Bensalem, Pennsylvania-based provider of housekeeping and dining services to healthcare facilities did not set aside enough money in 2014 and 2015 for expected settlements of class-action litigation claiming it violated federal and state wage-and-hour laws. Had the company properly recorded its settlement costs, it would have missed Wall Street earnings forecasts at least four times and been unable to report multiple quarters of increased earnings per share, thereby misleading investors, the SEC said. The SEC called the settlement the third in its EPS Imitative, which uses risk-based data analysis to uncover potential accounting and disclosure violations resulting from so-called ""earnings management,"" among other things. John Shea, Healthcare Services' chief financial officer since 2012, will pay a related $50,000 civil fine and accepted a two-year suspension from appearing before the SEC as an accountant. The company said he will become chief administrative officer on Sept. 1. It did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Derya Warner, the company's controller, agreed to a $10,000 SEC fine, the regulator said. None of the defendants admitted or denied wrongdoing.

Afghan evacuation on 'war footing' as G7 meets on pullout deadline,6216,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Western troops at Kabul airport worked frantically on Tuesday to evacuate people from Afghanistan before an Aug. 31 deadline as U.S. President Joe Biden faced growing pressure to negotiate more time for the airlift of thousands trying to flee. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - were due to meet virtually on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push for a deadline extension. Chaos punctuated by sporadic violence has gripped the airport, with foreign troops and Afghan security guards driving back crowds clamouring to get on flights following the Taliban's takeover of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15. Countries that have evacuated some 58,700 people over the past 10 days were trying to meet the deadline agreed earlier with the Taliban for the withdrawal of foreign forces, a NATO diplomat told Reuters. ""Every foreign force member is working at a war-footing pace to meet the deadline,"" said the official, who declined to be identified. Biden, who has said U.S. troops might stay beyond the deadline, has warned the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. A Taliban official said on Monday an extension would not be granted, though he said foreign forces had not sought one. Washington said negotiations were continuing. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday, two U.S. sources told Reuters. Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the days remaining. ""It's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. British defence minister Ben Wallace told Sky News he was doubtful there would be a deadline extension. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany was working with the United States and Britain to ensure the NATO allies can fly civilians out after the deadline. ""Even if the deadline is Aug. 31 or is extended by a few days, it will not be enough to evacuate those we want to evacuate and those that the United States wants to evacuate,"" Maas told Bild newspaper. ""That's why we are working with the United States and Britain to ensure that once the military evacuation is completed it is still possible to fly civilians out of Kabul airport."" In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin was interested in serving as a middleman in resolving the crisis along with China, the United States and Pakistan.

At the same time, he said, Russia opposes the idea of allowing Afghan refugees to enter the ex-Soviet region of Central Asia or having United States troops deployed there. ""If you think that any country in Central Asia or elsewhere is interested in becoming a target so that the Americans could fulfil their initiatives, I really doubt anyone needs that,"" Lavrov said during a visit to Hungary. RED LINE The frantic evacuation operation kicked off after the Taliban seized Kabul on Aug. 15 and the U.S.-backed government collapsed as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after a 20-year presence. The militant group had been ousted by U.S.-led forces in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants whose leaders had found safe haven in Afghanistan. Many Afghans fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Taliban enforced when in power from 1996 to 2001, in particular the repression of women. The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said she had received credible reports of serious violations committed by the Taliban, including summary execution of civilians and restrictions on women and protests against their rule. read more ""A fundamental red line will be the Taliban's treatment of women and girls,"" she told an emergency session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. An Afghan diplomat from the former government told the forum that millions of people feared for their lives amid reports of door-to-door searches. China's U.N. envoy said the U.S. army and its partners should be held accountable for rights violations they committed in Afghanistan. The G7 leaders could discuss taking a united stand on the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government, or alternatively renew sanctions to pressure the Islamist militant movement to comply with pledges to respect women's rights and international relations. ""The G7 leaders will agree to coordinate on if, or when, to recognise the Taliban,"" said one European diplomat. ""And they will commit to continue to work closely together."" Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government that have included discussions with some old enemies from past governments, including a former president, Hamid Karzai. The Pajhwok news agency reported that Taliban officials had been appointed to various posts including a governor of Kabul, acting interior and finance ministers and intelligence chief. A Taliban spokesman was not available for comment. Recognition of a Taliban government by other countries would have important consequences, like allowing the Taliban access to foreign aid that previous Afghan governments have depended upon. Biden has faced widespread criticism over the withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, under a deal struck with the Taliban, and his opinion poll ratings have slipped. While Western countries have been trying to get people out, humanitarian agencies are struggling to get aid in. The World Health Organization only has enough supplies in Afghanistan to last for a week, an agency official said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Paralympics set to open in Tokyo amid worsening COVID-19 crisis,2557,"TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The 2020 Paralympic Games will kick off in Tokyo with the opening ceremony on Tuesday as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak so far, record daily cases and an overwhelmed medical system. The organisers admitted last week that the Paralympics will be held under ""very difficult"" circumstancesas Japan's health situation has worsened since the Olympic Games ended on Aug. 8 and hospitals in the host city are filled to capacity. The Japanese government and the Tokyo Metropolitan government appealed on Monday to hospitals in the capital to accept more COVID-19 patients as increasing infections have made access to care increasingly difficult. ""I'm a little concerned about holding the Paralympic Games. Still, I hope the athletes will do their best,"" said 52-year-old office worker Chika Sasagawa. While the number of athletes and officials travelling from abroad is less than a third of that during the Olympics, Japan reported more than 25,000 daily cases on three days last week, up from less than 15,000 when the Olympics ended earlier this month. Organisers of the Paralympics, which will take place between Aug. 24 and Sept. 5, have said they plan to implement the same COVID-19 protocols or ""playbook"" as the ones used during the Olympics. Frequent testing and other restrictions, such as limiting the movement of athletes and officials, proved to be effective in minimising infection risks during the Games, they have added. Like the Olympics, the Paralympics will also take place generally without spectators and organisers have asked the domestic Games officials to avoid eating out or drinking in groups. Olympic organisers reported404 Games-related infections. They carried out close to 600,000 screening tests with an infection rate of 0.02%. Japan has extended COVID-19 emergency measures in the capital and other regions that will run through the Games. About 88% of thousands of athletes and officials attending the Games have been vaccinated, the International Paralympic Committee spokesperson Craig Spence has said, though a number of local volunteers are yet to be fully vaccinated. ""Compared to the Olympics, the COVID infections have spread further now. I have many concerns but I believe that Japan as a host country is making all the efforts so that athletes can compete safely in the Games,"" said Tokyo resident Kana Matsuyama, 45.

"EXCLUSIVE Venezuela swapped PDVSA oil for food, then punished the dealmakers",8095,"CARACAS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - With U.S. sanctions spooking key oil buyers and depriving its government of cash, Venezuela last year inked a deal with a little-known local company to swap crude for food, Reuters has learned. That agreement saw state oil company PDVSA, beginning in December 2020, deliver more than 6 million barrels of crude worth nearly $260 million to a company named Supraquimic C.A., which was to supply food for a government program. But the arrangement collapsed when PDVSA accused two executives linked to Supraquimic with embezzling the proceeds, according to criminal charges filed by Venezuelan prosecutors in late March. This account of the deal and its demise is based on dozens of pages of internal PDVSA documents viewed by Reuters, court filings by prosecutors, and interviews with three people familiar with the situation. It offers a rare glimpse inside one of the maneuvers that Venezuela's socialist government devised to continue exporting crude - the lifeblood of its beleaguered economy - despite U.S. sanctions. Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil or information ministries or chief prosecutor's office responded to requests for comment. President Nicolas Maduro has called U.S. sanctions illegal and blames Washington and his domestic political opponents for the country's woes. The Supraquimic deal is also the latest example of how Venezuela, cut off from the global financial system and short of hard currency after years of economic decline, has turned to bartering its crude. It has previously used oil to pay down debts, buy gasoline and diesel, and purchase water trucks. Maduro has even proposed using oil to buy coronavirus vaccines. Just as important, the Supraquimic deal provided PDVSA with a new customer. Since the United States blacklisted PDVSA in early 2019, many major clients have stopped buying. In their place, a series of mysterious, recently-formed companies with no previous oil experience have materialized to buy PDVSA's oil, including previously-unknown Mexican and Russian firms. Purchases by these new players have allowed Venezuela's crude exports to climb sharply this year, internal PDVSA shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data show. ""It is amazing how Venezuela has mutated to overcome difficulties coming from sanctions, which is making Venezuela's oil trade increasingly opaque,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute. It's all part of a cat-and-mouse game that Caracas is playing with U.S. authorities to keep selling its most important commodity. Washington has barred American companies from purchasing Venezuelan oil and has threatened to punish firms based anywhere in the world that do business with PDVSA. ""Maduro and his supporters have attempted to exploit U.S. policy in support of humanitarian related transactions by disguising their attempts to squeeze profit from Venezuelan resources as oil-for-food schemes,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. ""We do not preview our sanctions, but of course evasion schemes may prove vulnerable to sanctions,"" the statement read. The Supraquimic deal also demonstrates potential perils for companies doing business with Venezuela's government, which has sparred repeatedly with the private sector even as the Socialist Party has courted their investment to boost the economy. In 2015, for example, with Venezuela rocked by shortages of consumer goods, authorities detained executives of a pharmacy chain and workers at a leading food company on accusations of hoarding supply to destabilize the economy, which they denied. Venezuela's industrialists have blamed Maduro's socialist economic policies for the nation's woes. ""The main risk to doing business with the government is not that you're going to lose money or that your assets are going to be expropriated. It's that you're going to end up in jail,"" said Jose Ignacio Hernandez, a specialist in Venezuelan administrative law and economic regulation at the Harvard Kennedy School and the former legal representative for Venezuela's opposition. Venezuela's Information Ministry did not reply to a request for a response to Hernandez's assertions. Such tensions were on display again on March 30, when Venezuelan authorities issued arrest warrants for Supraquimic President Oscar Garcia as well as Jose Llamozas, who owns firms that sold food to Supraquimic. Both were charged with embezzlement, collusion between a public official and a contractor, and illicit association, according to the prosecutor's request to a judge for the warrant. Garcia, whose whereabouts are unknown, did not respond to phone calls, emails and messages to social media profiles seeking comment. Reuters could not determine whether Garcia was ever arrested or if he has legal representation. Llamozas, who was jailed for three months before being released on July 2 pending a possible trial, did not respond to messages sent to phone numbers and email addresses listed for his companies. Llamozas' defense counsel did not respond to requests for comment. In Venezuela, prosecutors first charge a suspect and then investigate further before deciding whether or not to recommend to a judge that the case go forward, according to Jose Vicente Haro, a law professor at the Central University of Venezuela. 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCE' The arrangement between PDVSA and Supraquimic began with a request from Venezuela's Food Ministry to ensure supply for its CLAP boxes, a food handout program that many families depend on to survive, according to a copy of a contract between the two companies and the ministry which was viewed by Reuters. That contract, dated April 2020 and described as a ""strategic alliance,"" stipulated that Supraquimic would receive up to 5 million barrels of crude per month from PDVSA in exchange for supplying food products of equal value to the Food Ministry. Supraquimic, in turn, would be responsible for selling the oil. Supraquimic was founded by Garcia in Caracas in 2015, according to government commercial registry records. In total, the company received from PDVSA six cargoes between Dec. 28, 2020 and Feb. 10, 2021, totaling 6.2 million barrels valued at $257.8 million, according to internal oil company invoices viewed by Reuters. That was in line with market prices at the time. All the shipments set sail in tankers bound for Asia, according to the PDVSA invoices and shipping documents, and Refinitiv Eikon data. Reuters could not determine how much food, if any, Supraquimic delivered to the CLAP program. But according to a March 4 letter written to company officials by Antonio Perez Suarez, PDVSA's vice president for supply and trading, it was not enough to satisfy the agreement. ""You have not honored your payment commitments according to the contractual terms established and accepted by your company,"" Perez Suarez wrote in that letter, viewed by Reuters. Supraquimic does not appear to be a food manufacturer. It purchased products from Venezuelan companies including Alimentos Santa Lucia and Agroinsumos El Granero, both owned by Llamozas, according to a person familiar with the deal. Llamozas' companies agreed to sell food items totaling $80 million to Supraquimic in installments, the person said. But after receiving payment for delivery of an initial $8 million worth of products, Llamozas' firms stopped shipping because they received no further funds, leaving Supraquimic unable to meet its obligations to the government, the person said. On March 30, Llamozas was summoned to PDVSA's offices, according to the person. He was arrested in the oil company's parking lot, according to the police arrest report. While Llamozas was in jail, Maduro found another source of help to feed some of the estimated 7 million Venezuelans experiencing food insecurity in what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest nations. The U.N. World Food Programme in April reached a deal with his administration to deliver monthly rations to school children. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Amid COVID surge, some Sri Lankans opt for cardboard coffins",2247,"COLOMBO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - At a factory in Sri Lanka's Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia city, workers use staples and glue to assemble long cardboard boxes, which will be used as coffins for some of the country's coronavirus victims. The coffin is made out of recycled paper and costs a sixth of the cheapest wooden casket, according to 51-year old Priyantha Sahabandu, the local government official who first came up with the idea. As Sri Lanka's death toll from COVID-19 surges, some are opting for these cardboard coffins when they cremate their loved ones. The country recorded its highest daily death toll of 198 on Friday, with total fatalities reaching 7,560. Currently, about 400 people die per day on average in Sri Lanka of various causes, including COVID-19, said Sahabandu, a member of the municipal council for Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, a city in Colombo district. ""To make 400 coffins you have to cut some 250 to 300 trees. To prevent that environmental destruction I proposed this concept to the health committee of the council,"" he said.

The coffins were initially used mostly for COVID-19 victims, but have become more popular among those concerned about the environment. Some 350 cardboard coffins have been delivered since early 2020, and the factory is working on another 150 ordered by the council. ""The majority of the people in the country support this. The issue today is supplying it. We are working on that,"" Sahabandu said.

U.S. donation of COVID-19 vaccines arrives in West Bank and Gaza,1783,"RAMALLAH, West Bank, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. donation of 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza on Tuesday, as Palestinian officials work to boost uptake and counter a surge in new cases by requiring some workers to get the jab. The Palestinians began administering vaccines in February, but despite having purchased or received what officials have called ""an abundance of doses"", uptake has stalled at just 35% of age-eligible Palestinians in the West Bank, and around 11% in Gaza. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, whose Palestinian Authority (PA) has limited self-rule in the West Bank, said on Monday that unvaccinated public-sector employees would be put on unpaid leave, with immediate effect. Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas are requiring all working individuals and service providers to take the vaccine by Sept. 1, Hamas interior ministry spokesman Iyad al-Bozum wrote on Twitter. With the U.S. donation of 500,000 Moderna (MRNA.O) doses, facilitated through the global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, the Palestinians say they have now received 2.5 million doses.

U.S. review of COVID's China origin unlikely to solve vexing questions,3648,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is set to be briefed on the U.S. intelligence community's investigation into how COVID-19 started, with the report likely to disappoint in delivering clear answers about the deadly pandemic's origin in China. Biden in May ordered aides to work to resolve disputes among intelligence agencies examining rival theories about how the novel coronavirus started, including a once-dismissed theory about the possibility of a laboratory accident in China, as well as that the virus originated naturally with animals, such as bats or birds. A 90-day intelligence review the president ordered is due on Tuesday, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, with the release of unclassified portions likely to take a few days longer. Yet three U.S. government officials and a fourth person familiar with the scope of the investigation said they did not expect the review to lead to firm conclusions after China stymied earlier international efforts to gather key information on the ground. Instead, one official said the report would likely point to additional lines of inquiry that officials could pursue, including demands of China that are likely to further ratchet up tensions with Beijing at a time when the country's ties with Washington are at their lowest point in decades. ""It's basically impossible to have a proper investigation if one of the main parties doesn't want to cooperate,"" said Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-author of ""Aftershocks,"" a book about the pandemic with Biden's Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl. ""We need to proceed as if both hypotheses are true."" The report also comes as the U.S. intelligence agencies have come under pressure from within the administration and Congress over issues related to the handling of Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban came faster than many U.S. intelligence, defense and diplomatic analysts predicted. COVID-19 has killed 4.6 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, but its precise origins remain shrouded in mystery. The first known cases emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and U.S. agencies started looking into the origins shortly afterwards. U.S. spy agencies initially strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. A team led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal. But their March report, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists and concluded that the lab theory was ""extremely unlikely,"" did not satisfy Washington. read more People familiar with intelligence reporting have said that there has been little corroboration over recent months that the virus had spread widely and naturally amongst wild animals. Meanwhile, China has refused to give U.S. researchers the kind of access to the Wuhan lab and officials there that the U.S. believes it would need to definitively try to determine the virus' origins. The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new group to further examine the origins of the virus causing COVID-19.

U.S. donation of COVID-19 vaccines arrives in West Bank and Gaza,1783,"RAMALLAH, West Bank, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. donation of 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza on Tuesday, as Palestinian officials work to boost uptake and counter a surge in new cases by requiring some workers to get the jab. The Palestinians began administering vaccines in February, but despite having purchased or received what officials have called ""an abundance of doses"", uptake has stalled at just 35% of age-eligible Palestinians in the West Bank, and around 11% in Gaza. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, whose Palestinian Authority (PA) has limited self-rule in the West Bank, said on Monday that unvaccinated public-sector employees would be put on unpaid leave, with immediate effect. Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas are requiring all working individuals and service providers to take the vaccine by Sept. 1, Hamas interior ministry spokesman Iyad al-Bozum wrote on Twitter. With the U.S. donation of 500,000 Moderna (MRNA.O) doses, facilitated through the global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, the Palestinians say they have now received 2.5 million doses. The West Bank will take 300,000 of the donation and Gaza 200,000. Officials also expect to receive 1 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine in September. New infections have spiked since the emergence of the highly-infectious Delta variant. PA Health Minister Mai Alkaila said the Palestinians are ""on the precipice of a fourth wave in terms of cases, deaths and hospital occupancy"". Cases in the West Bank, home to 3 million Palestinians, rose to 696 on Tuesday, up from just 83 two weeks ago. Gaza, where 2 million Palestinians live, had 874 cases on Tuesday, up from 77 two weeks ago. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. review of COVID's China origin unlikely to solve vexing questions,3648,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is set to be briefed on the U.S. intelligence community's investigation into how COVID-19 started, with the report likely to disappoint in delivering clear answers about the deadly pandemic's origin in China. Biden in May ordered aides to work to resolve disputes among intelligence agencies examining rival theories about how the novel coronavirus started, including a once-dismissed theory about the possibility of a laboratory accident in China, as well as that the virus originated naturally with animals, such as bats or birds. A 90-day intelligence review the president ordered is due on Tuesday, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, with the release of unclassified portions likely to take a few days longer. Yet three U.S. government officials and a fourth person familiar with the scope of the investigation said they did not expect the review to lead to firm conclusions after China stymied earlier international efforts to gather key information on the ground. Instead, one official said the report would likely point to additional lines of inquiry that officials could pursue, including demands of China that are likely to further ratchet up tensions with Beijing at a time when the country's ties with Washington are at their lowest point in decades. ""It's basically impossible to have a proper investigation if one of the main parties doesn't want to cooperate,"" said Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-author of ""Aftershocks,"" a book about the pandemic with Biden's Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl. ""We need to proceed as if both hypotheses are true."" The report also comes as the U.S. intelligence agencies have come under pressure from within the administration and Congress over issues related to the handling of Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban came faster than many U.S. intelligence, defense and diplomatic analysts predicted. COVID-19 has killed 4.6 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, but its precise origins remain shrouded in mystery. The first known cases emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and U.S. agencies started looking into the origins shortly afterwards. U.S. spy agencies initially strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. A team led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal. But their March report, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists and concluded that the lab theory was ""extremely unlikely,"" did not satisfy Washington. read more People familiar with intelligence reporting have said that there has been little corroboration over recent months that the virus had spread widely and naturally amongst wild animals. Meanwhile, China has refused to give U.S. researchers the kind of access to the Wuhan lab and officials there that the U.S. believes it would need to definitively try to determine the virus' origins. The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new group to further examine the origins of the virus causing COVID-19.

"German SPD ahead of conservatives a month before election, poll shows",2221,"BERLIN, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have pulled ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives for the first time in 15 years, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, just a month before the country's federal election. Germany goes to the polls on Sept. 26, when Merkel steps down as chancellor after 16 years in office and four straight national election victories. Merkel's imminent departure has heightened divisions over the direction of the party. Support for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been falling steadily in recent weeks. The SPD was up 2 percentage points compared to a week ago on 23%, while the CDU/CSU slipped a point to 22% and the Greens are down a point at 18%, according to the Forsa poll for RTL/NTV. Forsa said this was the first time that the SPD had been ahead of the CDU/CSU since October 2006, with the latest rating for Merkel's party at its lowest level since the polling institute was set up in 1984. Some conservatives have blamed the drop in support on the bloc's candidate for chancellor, CDU chairman Armin Laschet, whose ratings have tumbled since he was caught on camera laughing during a visit last month to a town hit by floods. Support for Laschet fell again in the Forsa poll, while it rose for the SPD's candidate, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. Health Minister Jens Spahn, a close Laschet ally, has ruled out suggestions that replacing Laschet with a more popular candidate, such as Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, was the only way to secure a comfortable victory. read more The CDU, which got just under 33% of the vote in the last election in 2017, currently govern in coalition with the SPD. The most recent polls mean that the only possible coalitions would need three parties to work together rather than the current two, potentially making negotiations more protracted. The Forsa poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. The poll about party preferences was conducted on Aug. 17-23 among 2,504 people, while the poll ranking the leaders was conducted on Aug. 18-20 among 1,532 people.

Switzerland hit by 'very worrying' fourth COVID-19 wave,1284,"ZURICH, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronavirus with a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of the government's crisis team at the Federal Office for Public Health said on Tuesday. The number of new infections has hovered between 2,500 and 3,000 per day recently, close to the level of the third wave earlier this year, Patrick Mathys said. ""The current situation should be seen as unfavourable and to some extent very worrying,"" Mathys told a press conference in Bern. ""We have to describe the current situation as the fourth wave."" The number of new infections rose by 2,993 on Tuesday, taking the total number to 761,978 since the pandemic began. The government also reported six more deaths, taking the death toll to 10,461. Mathys said he was concerned about hospitals and the low level of vaccinations. Around 56% of the population have had at least one dose and 50% have had two. The vast majority of COVID-19 hospitalisations were of people who had not been vaccinated, Mathys said. ""The stagnating vaccination figures do not indicate that the situation could ease in the foreseeable future,"" Mathys said. ""The proportion of the non-immune population is still far too large.""

"China should avoid excessive, ""flood-like"" COVID measures -former CDC expert",1925,"BEIJING, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The benefits of China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 continue to outweigh the costs but it should cut back on excessive measures that risk exhausting people, a former Chinese disease control official said on Tuesday. Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said ""flood-like"" measures and policies that prove inefficient should be avoided even though China has the financial resources to keep pursuing the goal of zero local infections. Since late July, China has brought under control clusters of infections driven mainly by the highly transmissible Delta variant of the new coronavirus. That was achieved by swift contact tracing and locking down areas deemed high-risk, even when only a handful of cases were detected. In cities where most infections were found, multiple rounds of testing on local populations were undertaken and travel restrictions imposed. Those measures have required significant human resources and have disrupted the tourism, services and logistics sectors, prompting analysts to downgrade forecasts for China's economic growth for the quarter ending in September. ""It becomes more difficult for us to have zero infections with the Delta variant, and the cost (of achieving that) has increased,"" Zeng told an online presentation. ""But we still have to continue to (aim for) zero infections, because the dividends of doing so still exists."" Zeng was part of a top team at China's National Health Commission when the virus started to spread from the central city of Wuhan to other parts of China last year. Noting that China was the only major economy to grow last year, Zeng said ""we have the financial resources"" to support the zero-tolerance strategy. ""If we want to, we can tap (the equivalent of) one-tenth of our GDP growth to deal with Delta,"" he added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. shipping 3 mln doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to Pakistan,1222,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The United States will ship just over 3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Pakistan via the COVAX global distribution program on Tuesday, bringing the total number of doses sent there to around 8.5 million, a White House official said. An additional 700,000 doses will follow, the official said. It was not immediately clear when they would be shipped to Pakistan. Scientific teams and legal and regulatory authorities from both countries worked together to ensure the delivery of the 3,006,900 vaccine lots made by Pfizer (PFE.N) and Germany's BioNTech (22UAy.DE), the official said. The shipment is part of a U.S. vaccine diplomacy effort that has sent vaccines to dozens of countries. The doses will be delivered through the COVAX program, jointly run by the World Health Organization, the official said.

Iran's COVID-19 deaths hit record daily high of 709,1692,"DUBAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Iran on Tuesday reported a record daily 709 deaths from COVID-19 as the worst-hit country in the Middle East faced a fifth surge in infections led by the highly contagious Delta variant. The health ministry said the total number of cases had reached 4.75 million with 40,623 new infections over the past 24 hours. Total fatalities rose to 103,357, state TV reported. Authorities imposed a two-week road travel ban between cities in the Islamic Republic until Aug. 27, except for essential vehicles. Non-essential businesses and public offices were allowed to reopen on Sunday after a week of mandatory shutdown to help limit the spread of coronavirus infections. The government has not yet announced whether or not new restrictions will be imposed soon. Health authorities have warned that daily deaths might reach 800 in coming weeks if Iranians fail to respect health precautions. Social media users have criticised the government for being slow to vaccinate people - only about 6.5 million of the 83 million population are fully inoculated. Officials have blamed U.S. sanctions and delays in importing vaccines. Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from U.S. sanctions reimposed on Tehran in 2018 after President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme. But the U.S. measures, which target sectors including oil and financial activities, have deterred some foreign banks from processing financial transactions with Iran. Tehran says this has frequently disrupted efforts to import essential medicines and other humanitarian items. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
EXCLUSIVE Limited Chinese cooperation hindering U.S. fentanyl fight -congress report,4335,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Weak cooperation between U.S. and Chinese authorities is hindering efforts to curb increasingly sophisticated forms of fentanyl trafficking, according to a U.S. congressional advisory report reviewed by Reuters. The report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, due to be published on Tuesday, said U.S. authorities have found that cooperation with Chinese counterparts ""remains limited on the ground"". An explosion in the use of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin, and its analogues has driven the most devastating chapter of America's long-running opioid and drug abuse crises. Combating fentanyl smuggling has become a key priority for U.S. agencies as overdose deaths spiked to more than 93,000 in 2020, mostly linked to fentanyl, according to provisional data by the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths surged by more than 21,000 to eclipse a record set a year earlier. Despite China banning fentanyl and similar variants in 2019, the Asian nation remains the primary source of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked into the United States, the report said. The accusations are unreasonable and unacceptable, said the Chinese foreign ministry when asked by Reuters to comment on the report. China has strictly controlled all narcotics, psychotropic drugs and chemical precursors, and its efforts are recognised internationally, the ministry said. There have been some improvements in collaboration as U.S. officials have established working groups, conducted high-level meetings and shared information with Chinese partners that led to arrests. However, the advisory body warned there ""remain significant gaps in U.S.-China antidrug cooperation"". Chinese regulatory authorities delay requests for access to inspect and investigate potential sites where companies illegally manufacture precursor chemicals that Mexican and other foreign drug cartels use to produce fentanyl, it said. ""Requests are often delayed for days, allowing any illegal operation to vacate or clean up the premises"", the report said. Chinese cooperation also ""lags in money laundering investigations, criminal prosecution, and legal assistance in ongoing cases"", the advisory body added. ""The U.S. cannot harm China's interests while expecting China to cooperate unconditionally,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said. FENTANYL SHIPMENTS FALL The amount of finished fentanyl shipped from China to the United States has declined since 2019 when Beijing banned the synthetic drug. Yet illicit fentanyl from China remains widely available in the United States, the report said. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) believes Chinese traffickers have shifted from mainly manufacturing finished fentanyl to mostly exporting precursors to Mexican cartels, which make illicit fentanyl and deliver the final product. The authors of the congressional report, titled ""Illicit Fentanyl from China: An Evolving Global Operation"", warned that the sophistication of traffickers was growing and both Chinese and U.S. authorities were struggling to adapt. On top of relocating some manufacturing to India, Chinese traffickers were re-routing shipments via third countries and using new marketing methods to circumvent local regulations drafted by Beijing. ""China's weak supervision and regulation of its chemical and pharmaceutical industry also enable evasion and circumvention,"" the report said. Chinese traffickers are increasing their cooperation with Mexican cartels, and especially the two biggest crime syndicates, the Sinaloa cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Both groups operate ""pill mills"" in Mexican cities, where they manufacture illegal fentanyl to ship to the United States, a growing trend in recent years. ""The growing involvement of Mexican cartels and advanced money laundering schemes have exacerbated the problem"", the report said. Chinese criminals are increasingly using the Chinese banking system to launder Mexican drug money, the report said, citing an investigation by Reuters into how Chinese brokers were muscling out Colombian and Mexican money launderers. These Chinese brokers use financial technology, mobile banking apps and social media to evade authorities, the report said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel's COVID-19 vaccine boosters show signs of taming Delta,5176,"JERUSALEM, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Less than a month into a COVID-19 vaccine booster drive, Israel is seeing signs of an impact on the country's high infection and severe illness rates fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant, officials and scientists say. Delta hit Israel in June, just as the country began to reap the benefits of one of the world's fastest vaccine roll-outs. With an open economy and most curbs scrapped, Israel went from single-digit daily infections and zero deaths to around 7,500 daily cases last week, 600 people hospitalized in serious condition and more than 150 people dying in that week alone. On July 30, it began administering a third dose of the Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNtech (22UAy.DE) vaccine to people over 60, the first country to do so. On Thursday it expanded eligibility to 30-year-olds and up whose second dose was given at least 5 months prior, saying the age may drop further. In the past 10 days, the pandemic is abating among the first age group, more than a million of whom have received a third vaccine dose, according to Israeli health ministry data and scientists interviewed by Reuters. The rate of disease spread among vaccinated people age 60 and over - known as the reproduction rate - began falling steadily around Aug. 13 and has dipped below 1, indicating that each infected person is transmitting the virus to fewer than one other person. A reproduction rate of less than 1 means an outbreak is subsiding. https://tmsnrt.rs/3grj7kv Scientists said booster shots are having an impact on infections, but other factors are likely contributing to the decline as well. ""The numbers are still very high but what has changed is that the very high increase in the rate of infections and severe cases has diminished, as has the pace at which the pandemic is spreading,"" said Eran Segal, data scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science and an adviser to the government. ""This is likely due to the third booster shots, an uptake in people taking the first dose and the high number of people infected per week, possibly up to 100,000, who now have natural immunity,"" Segal said. BOOSTER VS LOCKDOWN After reaching one of the highest per-capita infection rates in the world this month, the question now is whether Israel can battle its way out of a fourth outbreak without imposing another lockdown that would damage its economy. An Israeli woman poses for a picture as she receives a third shot of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine as country launches booster shots for over 40-year-olds, in Jerusalem August 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo Evidence has emerged showing that while the vaccine is still highly effective in preventing serious illness, its protection diminishes with time. But there is no consensus among scientists and agencies that a third dose is necessary, and the World Health Organization has said more of the world should be vaccinated with a first dose before people receive a third dose. read more The United States has announced plans to offer booster doses to all Americans, eight months after their second vaccine dose, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have also planned booster campaigns. About a million of Israel's 9.3 million population have so far chosen not to vaccinate at all and children under 12 are still not eligible for the shots. On Thursday, health officials said they have identified waning immunity among people under 40, although relatively few have fallen seriously ill. read more According to Doron Gazit, a member of the Hebrew University's COVID-19 expert team which advises government, the rise in cases of severely ill vaccinated people in the 60 and older group has been steadily slowing to a halt in the last 10 days. ""We attribute this to the booster shots and to more cautious behaviour recently,"" Gazit said. More than half of those over 60 have received a third jab, according to the Health ministry. The rate of new severe cases among unvaccinated patients 70 and older is now seven times that of vaccinated patients, and the gap will continue to grow as long as infections rise, according to Gazit. Among those over 50, that gap is four-fold. ""We are optimistic, but very cautious,"" Israeli Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz told public broadcaster Kan on Sunday. ""It gives us more time, slows the spread and we're moving away from lockdown."" But even if the boosters are slowing the pandemic's pace, it is unlikely to fend Delta off entirely. Dvir Aran, biomedical data scientist at Technion - Israel's Institute of Technology, said that while cases are retreating, other measures are needed alongside boosters to stop the pandemic. ""It will take a long time until enough people get a third dose and until then thousands more people will getting seriously ill."" Since Delta's surge, Israel has reimposed indoor mask wearing, limitations on gatherings and ramped up rapid testing. Its ""living with COVID"" policy will be tested come September, when schools reopen after summer break and when the Jewish holiday season starts, with families traditionally gathering to celebrate.

Afghan evacuation on 'war footing' as G7 meets on pullout deadline,5429,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Western forces at Kabul airport worked frantically on Tuesday to get people out of Afghanistan before an Aug. 31 deadline, as U.S. President Joe Biden faced growing pressure to negotiate more time for the airlift of thousands trying to flee. Widespread chaos punctuated by sporadic violence has gripped Kabul's airport, with Western troops and Afghan security guards driving back crowds, following the Taliban's takeover of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15. Countries that have evacuated some 58,700 people over the past 10 days were trying to meet the deadline agreed earlier with the Taliban for the withdrawal of foreign forces, a NATO diplomat told Reuters. ""Every foreign force member is working at a war-footing pace to meet the deadline,"" said the official, who declined to be identified. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - will meet virtually on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push for a deadline extension. Biden, who has said U.S. troops might stay beyond the deadline, has warned the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the days remaining. ""It's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. A Taliban official said on Monday an extension would not be granted, though he said foreign forces had not sought one. Washington said negotiations were continuing. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday, the Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Reuters could not immediately verify the story. Britain's defence minister, Ben Wallace, told Sky News he was doubtful there would be a deadline extension. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany was working with the United States and Britain to ensure the NATO partners can fly civilians out after the deadline.

""Even if the deadline is Aug. 31 or is extended by a few days, it will not be enough to evacuate those we want to evacuate and those that the United States wants to evacuate,"" Maas said in an interview with Bild newspaper. ""That's why we are working with the United States and Britain to ensure that once the military evacuation is completed it is still possible to fly civilians out of Kabul airport."" RED LINE Many Afghans fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Taliban enforced when in power from 1996 to 2001, in particular the repression of women and freedom of speech. The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said she had received credible reports of serious violations committed by the Taliban, including summary execution of civilians and restrictions on women and protests against their rule. read more ""A fundamental red line will be the Taliban's treatment of women and girls,"" she told an emergency session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. An Afghan diplomat from the U.S.-backed government told the forum that millions of people feared for their lives amid reports of door-to-door searches while China's U.N. envoy said the U.S. army and its partners should be held accountable for rights violations they committed in Afghanistan. The G7 leaders could discuss taking a united stand on the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government, or alternatively renew sanctions to pressure the Islamist militant movement to comply with pledges to respect women's rights and international relations. ""The G7 leaders will agree to coordinate on if, or when, to recognise the Taliban,"" said one European diplomat. ""And they will commit to continue to work closely together."" Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government that have included discussions with some old enemies from past governments, including a former president, Hamid Karzai. The Pajhwok news agency reported that Taliban officials had been appointed to various posts including a governor of Kabul, acting interior and finance ministers and intelligence chief. A Taliban spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Recognition of a Taliban government by other countries would have important consequences, like allowing the Taliban access to foreign aid that previous Afghan governments have depended upon. Biden has faced widespread criticism over the Aug. 31 withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, under a deal struck with the Taliban, and his opinion poll ratings have slipped. While Western countries have been trying to get people out, humanitarian agencies are struggling to get aid in.

Afghan refugees in Indonesia call for expedited resettlement,1674,"JAKARTA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Afghan refugees protested in Indonesia on Tuesday against a prolonged resettlement process, saying they needed to be offered new homes now that repatriation was out of the question with the return of the Taliban. Thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, most of them from the Hazara ethnic minority, who have long been persecuted by the Taliban, have lived in Indonesia for years as they await resettlement in third countries such as Canada or Australia. On Tuesday, hundreds gathered outside the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the capital, Jakarta, despite coronavirus restrictions prohibiting demonstrations, to demand that their cases be expedited. ""In the past year the UNHCR has been telling us there is only one percent chance of resettlement,” refugee Hakmat Ziraki told Reuters. ""Today we come here to ask 'what is your answer now? Are you still encouraging voluntary repatriation?'."" ""Our people are dying every day,"" he said. ""We need some justice, we need resettlement.” A spokesperson for the UNHCR said that the situation in Afghanistan did not have any impact on the status of refugees in Indonesia or elsewhere and their resettlement programme was going on as usual. Indonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugees and is predominately seen as a transit country for those seeking asylum to a third country. Tuesday's protest saw minor scuffles between police after demonstrators were warned to disperse given the public health risks, with the capital still recovering from a wave of coronavirus infections.

Delta cases show 300 times higher viral load - S.Korea study,1770,"SEOUL, Aug 24 (Reuters) - People infected with the more transmissible Delta variant have a viral load 300 times higher than those with the original version of the COVID-19 virus, when symptoms are first observed, a South Korea study found. But the amount gradually decreased over time - to 30 times in four days and over 10 times in nine days - and it matched levels seen in other variants after 10 days, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Tuesday. The higher load means the virus spreads far more easily from person to person, increasing infections and hospitalisations, a health ministry official Lee Sang-won told a news conference. ""But it doesn't mean Delta is 300 times more infectious...we think its transmission rate is 1.6 times the Alpha variant, and about two times the original version of the virus,"" Lee said. The Delta variant of the novel coronavirus was first identified in India and the Alpha variant in the UK. To avoid the spread of the Delta variant, now the dominant strainworldwide, the KDCA urged people to immediately get tested when developing COVID-19 symptoms and avoid in-person meetings. The rapid spread of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates have caught much of Asia off-guard, especially in emerging markets, even as economies in Europe and North America reopen. read more The study compared the viral load of 1,848 patients infected with the Delta variant with 22,106 people who had other strains. South Korea reported 1,509 new coronavirus cases for Monday, raising the total to 239,287 infections, with 2,228 deaths. It has vaccinated 51.2% of its 52 million population with at least one dose of a vaccine, while 23.9% have been fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Six U.S. states do not join $26 bln opioid settlements with distributors, J&J",3438,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - At least six U.S. states, including Georgia, did not fully sign on to a proposed $26 billion settlement with three drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which have been accused of fueling the nation's opioid epidemic, according to the states' attorneys general. States had until Saturday to decide whether to support the $21 billion proposed settlement with McKesson Corp (MCK.N), AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and a separate $5 billion agreement with J&J. But in a sign that talks were continuing despite the passing of the deadline, Georgia - the most populous hold-out state - on Monday indicated it could wind up backing the agreement. ""We have not rejected the deal, but we have not joined because at the present time joining the national settlements does not guarantee the best outcome for Georgia and its counties, cities and citizens,"" said an emailed statement from the office of the attorney general, Christopher Carr. ""We remain active in representing Georgia throughout negotiations, and we’re going to continue to get input from Georgia stakeholders."" The state will litigate its claims if needed, the statement said. New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia also declined to join the deals, their state attorneys general said. New Hampshire agreed to the settlement with distributors but not the J&J agreement. The complex settlement formula envisions at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies get to decide whether a ""critical mass"" has joined and whether to finalize the deal. The size of the settlement is based on the number of participating states. Those that decline to join will instead seek a larger recovery by continuing to fight the defendants in the courts. The companies have already paid hundreds of millions in verdicts and other settlements. The deal, which was unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21, aims to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction. The money would go toward funding treatment and other services. The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with others, including doctors and regulators. McKesson said the companies have until Sept. 4 to determine if there is sufficient support for the agreements and said that process is ongoing. Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen declined to comment and J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The support of two other states, Nevada and Alabama, also appeared to be in doubt, according to sources familiar with the situation. Nevada's attorney general declined to comment and the Alabama attorney general did not respond to a request for comment. The participation of states is tied closely to that of their local governments, which brought the majority of the lawsuits. Cities and counties within participating states would have through Jan. 2 to sign on. Ultimately, $10.7 billion of the settlement money is tied to the extent to which localities participate. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead negotiator, last month said he expected ""well north"" of 40 states to join. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel bombs Hamas sites in Gaza over fire balloons -military,2512,"TEL AVIV, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Israeli warplanes bombed Hamas sites in Gaza in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave that caused brush fires in southern Israel, its military said early on Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the air strikes that targeted what the military said was a weapons production facility and a rocket launch site belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. Since an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire halted 11 days of Israel-Hamas fighting in May, Gaza militants have sporadically sent balloons carrying incendiary material into Israel, drawing Israeli strikes on Hamas facilities. Palestinians say the balloons are aimed at pressing Israel to ease restrictions on Gaza and allow aid to reach the territory. Balloons launched on Monday set off fires in Israeli fields along the Gaza border, Israel's Fire and Rescue Service said. Cross-border violence has spiked despite an Israeli announcement last week of a resumption of Qatari aid to Gaza, a decision that had been seen as bolstering the fragile truce. read more Confronting Gaza protesters burning tyres and throwing explosives along the border on Saturday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 41 Palestinians, critically injuring two, medics said. Palestinian gunfire seriously wounded an Israeli soldier, the military said. read more Days before Saturday's violence, Gaza militants launched a rocket towards Israel that was shot down by its Iron Dome anti-missile system, in the first such attack since the May 21 ceasefire. More than 250 Palestinians and 13 in Israel were killed in the May conflict, during which Gaza militants fired rockets towards Israeli cities and Israel carried out air strikes across the coastal enclave. Israel keeps Gaza under blockade, tightly restricting movement out of the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians. Egypt also maintains restrictions on the enclave. Both cite threats from Hamas for the restrictions. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 15-year-old was killed overnight in a clash with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military said its troops came under fire during an arrest raid near the city of Nablus. A soldier opened fire on a suspect who was about to throw a large object at the forces from a rooftop, the military said, and ""identified a hit"".

COVID-19 booster shots should follow after China inoculates more -state media,1705,"BEIJING, Aug 24 (Reuters) - COVID-19 booster shots should become available in China after the country vaccinates more people to provide broader protection against the disease, a senior executive at a Sinopharm unit responsible for developing COVID-19 vaccines told state media. While the World Health Organization has said current data does not indicate booster shots are needed, several countries have approved them amid resurgent infections and concerns of waning vaccine protection over time, especially against the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Zhang Yuntao, vice president at Sinopharm unit China National Biotec Group (CNBG), said that it is proper to make booster shots available in China after ""all people who should be vaccinated are vaccinated,"" according to an interview with the Global Times published late on Monday. He said the priority for booster shots should be given to people older than 60 who showed weaker immune responses to vaccines compared with younger people in clinical trials. Employees at restaurants and those working in aviation and delivery industries should also be prioritised, he said. China has fully vaccinated around 55% of its population as of Aug. 12, using several locally developed shots including two-dose vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O). The two companies said studies have showed that injecting a third dose led to a significant increase in antibodies, which faded over time after a two-course regimen. A lab study showed antibodies triggered by the Sinovac shot declined below a key threshold from around six months after a second dose for most recipients. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand COVID-19 Delta outbreak spreading rapidly as cases jump,2551,"WELLINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand on Tuesday recorded its highest increase in COVID-19 cases since April 2020, as authorities warned this current outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus was like dealing with a whole new virus. The South Pacific nation's virus-free run since February ended last week after an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and quickly spread to the capital Wellington. Authorities reported 41 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total infections in the country to 148, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference. That was the biggest increase in cases since April 10, 2020, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Of the new cases, 38 are in Auckland and three are in Wellington. So far, eight people associated with the current outbreak are in hospital, the ministry said. ""Delta is unlike our previous experience. It is, as we know, highly infectious and transmissible and, as we have seen, spreads rapidly,” Bloomfield said at a news conference. But he said it was reassuring to see the numbers were not rising exponentially and the majority were still in Auckland. CHURCH CLUSTER Authorities reported a cluster of at least 58 people of Samoan ethnicity and linked to the Samoan Assembly Of God Church in Auckland. The health ministry said there were unfortunately racist comments being directed at the community. ""The virus is the problem, not people,"" the ministry said on Twitter. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has garnered global praise for stamping out COVID-19 in the country. But her reliance on strict border controls and snap lockdowns that have impacted the economy has been called into question amid the latest outbreak, which has occurred while few people have been vaccinated. read more On Monday, Ardern extended the strict level 4 national lockdown to Aug. 27. In neighbouring Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is also under growing pressure for rising COVID-19 cases, said elimination cannot be pursued forever, flagging New Zealand as an example. ""Any state and territory that thinks that somehow they can protect themselves from COVID with the Delta strain forever, that's just absurd,"" he told the 9News breakfast show Today. ""I mean, New Zealand can't do that. They were following an elimination strategy. They're in lockdown. The way through is to get to those 70% and 80% (vaccination) marks, open safely,"" he said.

"Pandemic threatens Asia-Pacific's progress on global development goals, says ADB",2083,"MANILA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have pushed as many as 80 million people in developing Asia into extreme poverty last year, threatening to derail progress on global goals to tackle poverty and hunger by 2030, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday. Developing Asia's extreme poverty rate - or the proportion of its people living on less than $1.90 a day - would have fallen to 2.6% in 2020 from 5.2% in 2017 without COVID-19, but the crisis likely pushed last year's projected rate higher by about 2 percentage points, ADB simulations showed. The figure could even be higher considering the inequalities in areas like health, education and work disruptions that have deepened as the COVID-19 crisis disrupted mobility and stalled economic activity, the ADB said in a flagship report on the region. ""As the socioeconomic impacts of responses to the virus continue to unfold, people already struggling to make ends meet are at risk of tipping over into a life of poverty,"" the Manila-based lender said. Among reporting economies in Asia and the Pacific, which refers to the 46 developing and three developed ADB member economies, only about one in four posted economic growth last year, it said. As unemployment rates increased the region also lost about 8% of work hours, affecting poorer households and workers in the informal sector. The economic damage brought about by the pandemic had further intensified the challenge of meeting global development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015. U.N. members unanimously passed 17 Sustainable Development Goals, known as SDGs, in 2015, creating a blueprint of ambitious tasks from ending hunger and gender inequality to expanding access to education and health care. The goals had a deadline of 2030. ""Asia and the Pacific has made impressive strides, but COVID-19 has revealed social and economic fault lines that may weaken the region's sustainable and inclusive development,"" ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada said in a separate statement.

"Vietnam says Cuba to supply COVID-19 vaccine, transfer technology",1449,"HANOI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Cuba will supply large quantities of its home-grown COVID-19 vaccine, Abdala, to Vietnam and also transfer the production technology to the Southeast Asian country by the end of the year, the Vietnamese health ministry said on Tuesday. After successfully containing the disease for much of the pandemic, Vietnam has been struggling to control its worst outbreak to date, with a spike in infections and deaths ramping up pressure on authorities to speed up vaccinations. ""Cuba will send a large number of COVID doses and a team to Vietnam to support technology transfer by the end of this year,"" the health ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of doses. Cuba has said its three-shot Abdala vaccine was 92.28% effective against the coronavirus in last-stage clinical trials in June. Vietnam has so far signed deals for recombinant DNA protein and mRNA vaccine technology transfer and is also in talk with U.S. company Pfizer about locating a vaccine plant in the country. The Southeast Asian country has secured more than 23 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and expects to receive at least 50 million doses in the fourth quarter, the health ministry said. Vietnam's inoculation programme, which started in March, is still at an early stage with just 1.9% of the country's 98 million people fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the region.

"EXCLUSIVE Abu Dhabi conglomerate IHC eyes deals worth 'a few billion dollars', CEO says",2570,"DUBAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Co (IHC.AD) is considering acquisitions worth a few billion dollars in total across several sectors, including a real estate developer in Abu Dhabi, its chief executive Syed Basar Shueb told Reuters. IHC, now the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse with a market capitalisation of $72 billion, is also considering a 2022 initial public offering (IPO) for its majority-owned healthcare firm Pure Health, Shueb said in an interview. Pure Health has played a pivotal role in screening for COVID-19 infections in the United Arab Emirates. Shueb also said the tightly held conglomerate, active in sectors from food to leisure, is close to acquiring a second-tier Abu Dhabi property developer, which would add to its indirect minority stake in Aldar Properties (ALDAR.AD). He didn't identify any targets, nor specify how much the real estate deal might be worth. ""All the sectors across the nine verticals we are operating (in), we are looking for an acquisition,"" Shueb said. ""There are a few billion dollars of acquisitions we are looking at."" IHC is also looking at three or four targets in the food sector, as well as eyeing targets in the healthcare and leisure and retail sectors, he said. Shueb said the new deals will be funded by bank loans for the first time, while next year the firm plans to issue debut bonds, which would help it secure a credit rating for more transparency. IHC has reported surging earnings over the past year and a half, and its share price has more than tripled this year to 146.1 dirhams, as of Monday's close. In June, it overtook telecommunications firm Etisalat (ETISALAT.AD) as the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse. Its shares are closely held by a group headed by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser and a brother of the country's de facto ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. Royal Group, whose chairman is Sheikh Tahnoun, owns about 74% of IHC. Tahnoun is also chairman of IHC. Shueb said IHC plans to list six companies this year in total, giving domestic investors more opportunities in the Abu Dhabi market. But he said there are no plans to pay dividends. Instead, the aim is for the growth of IHC's operations and investment in its businesses to support a rise in the share price. ""We acquire, restructure, consolidate in our businesses, with diversification and then divestment,"" Shueb said. ($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Risks and rewards: How to bet big on yourself,4150,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - If you had to choose one word to describe the pandemic era, ""risky"" would be a strong candidate. In a deeply risky time for our health, careers and finances, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy has some tips. The former executive of familiar companies like StubHub, Google and Amazon penned a new book ""Choose Possibility: Take Risks and Thrive (Even When You Fail)"" about how to make risk work for you. Cassidy spoke with Reuters about betting big on yourself by opening up new paths and taking your career to the next level. Q: Generally speaking, are people not taking enough risk in their working lives? A: Humans fear failure, fear rejection, and fear looking foolish when trying new things at work. Many of these fears are ego-based: What will others think of us, or what will we think of ourselves if something goes awry? Ego-related risks hold people back in everyday working life. Q: Is now an opportune time for people to take a risk and chart new paths forward? A: COVID has catalyzed many great learnings on risk along with people's desire to change their lives. In the rapid response to the pandemic, we all learned something about our own agility and ability to take risks and make choices quickly, ironically to avoid a bigger danger. That tells us we are each capable of making new choices faster than we think, not only in the face of crisis, but also when times are good. Q: You say that risk-taking is like building up muscles – how so? A: One of the myths I wanted to bust is that some people are born to take risks. In fact, it's the opposite. Anyone can take risks in life – to learn, to discover, to achieve their ambitions. You can find dozens of reasons to take risks, and then take little ones every day. Then you have the benefit of learning from them if they work out. And even if they don't, you have inoculated yourself against the fear of failure. Q: Why can taking multiple risks be a smart strategy? A: People usually want to move serially: Make one choice first and then another. You don't make steady progress that way. But if you pursue multiple risks, magical things start to happen. We diversify our risk, because we aren't betting on only one thing. And you enjoy the benefits of multiple possibilities: Many people don't know what they want, so this way you can try many different things on for size. Q: Is it also risky to not take any risks? A: Yes, because there is the opportunity cost of what you are missing out on. That is actually more of a career threat, if the rest of the world is changing and you are not. Research shows the value of our skills degrades by 50% every five years. Think of it like failing to move on an escalator: If everyone else is moving forward, and you are standing still. Q: Working moms especially are overwhelmed right now, so what career advice would you have for them? A: We often fear the risks of asking for what we need to make something work. This especially applies to women. For instance, when I was running the international business at Google, a year into it I got pregnant. I wanted to keep the job, but we needed to figure out some creative solutions. So, I asked them to pay for a nanny and her travel expenses, which they did. I didn't walk into that discussion entitled, but I did walk in with a track record. Q: Silicon Valley has a reputation of ""tech bro"" culture, so what advice do you have for women about succeeding in that environment? A: Go where your values fit. We all move in environments of bias and prejudice, and it's harder for some people than for others. I've had success in companies with similar values, where I am free to be my full self. If you feel safe, you'll speak up and ask for what you need. Q: Is failure a part of the process? A: This is all about becoming a calculated risk-taker, and that likely means more failure, and also more success. If you are thoughtful about the choices you are making, over the course of your career, that should produce a solid win rate. Then you can reap the rewards of risk, no matter what the outcome of any individual decision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Biden expected to decide within 24 hours on Afghan evacuation deadline,5615,"KABUL/WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - With thousands of desperate Afghans and foreigners massed at Kabul's airport in the hope of fleeing Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers, U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to decide as soon as Tuesday on whether to extend an Aug. 31 deadline to airlift Americans and their allies to safety. Biden warned on Sunday that the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. U.S. troops might stay beyond an Aug. 31 deadline to oversee the evacuation, he said. On Monday, an administration official told Reuters that Biden would decide within 24 hours whether to extend the timeline to give the Pentagon time to prepare. Beyond the need to remove thousands of Americans, citizens of allied countries and Afghans who worked with U.S. forces, Department of Defense officials said it would still take days to fly out the 6,000 troops deployed to secure and run the airlift. Some Biden advisers were arguing against extending the self-imposed deadline for security reasons. Biden could signal his intentions at a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Tuesday. Two U.S. officials had said the expectation was that the United States would continue evacuations past Aug. 31. A senior State Department official told reporters the country's commitment to at-risk Afghans ""doesn't end on Aug. 31."" Later on Monday, Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing on Afghanistan by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the eight remaining days. ""I think it's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. A Taliban official said foreign forces had not sought an extension and it would not be granted if they had. Washington said negotiations were continuing. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States was in daily talks with the Taliban and making ""enormous progress"" in evacuating Americans and others. Between 3 a.m. and 3 p.m. local time on Monday, some 10,900 people were evacuated from Kabul, meaning the United States had facilitated the removal of 48,000 people since Aug. 14. U.S. defense officials had told Reuters that almost everything would have to go perfectly to extricate every American citizen by Aug. 31, given concerns about reaching the airport, terrorist attacks and complicated processing times. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters the United States had discussed future control of the airport with the Taliban, as well as with U.S. partners and allies. U.S. Marines and Norwegian coalition forces assist with security at an Evacuation Control Checkpoint ensuring evacuees are processed safely during an evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan, August 20, 2021. U.S. Marine Corps/Staff Sgt. Victor Mancilla 'DOES IT STILL HURT? YES' The Taliban's swift takeover and ensuing chaos in Afghanistan have roiled U.S. politics, with opposition Republicans piling criticism on Biden for the withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. Biden's opinion poll numbers have slipped. Biden's fellow Democrats who control Congress have promised to investigate what went wrong in Afghanistan within the past weeks and throughout the 20-year conflict, America's longest war. For its part, the powerful U.S. military has been grappling with the collapse of U.S.-backed Afghan forces after 20 years of training. ""Was it worth it? Yes. Does it still hurt? Yes,"" General David Berger, the commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote in a memo to Marines. The difficulties at the airport were underlined on Monday with a firefight between Afghan guards and unidentified gunmen. German and U.S. forces were also involved, the Germany military said. A local Taliban militant, speaking to a large crowd in Kabul, urged Afghans to remain. ""Where has our honor gone to? Where has our dignity gone to?"" the unidentified militant said. ""We will not let the Americans continue to be here. They will have to leave this place. Whether it is a gun or a pen, we will fight to our last breath."" WORKING WITH ALLIES The Taliban seized power last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after the war launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Panicked Afghans and foreigners have thronged the airport since, clamoring to catch any flight out. Many fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law the Taliban enforced while in power from 1996 to 2001. Twenty people have been killed, most in shootings and stampedes, as international forces try to bring order. One member of the Afghan forces was killed and several wounded in Monday's clash, the U.S. military said. A British government spokesperson said British evacuations could not continue once U.S. troops leave. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said more time was needed. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the virtual G7 summit must agree on whether to extend the deadline and how to improve access to the airport. The airport chaos also disrupted aid shipments. The World Health Organization said tons of medical supplies were stuck because Kabul airport was closed to commercial flights. Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government, while their forces focus on the last pockets of opposition.

FDA approves Cara's drug for severe itching in kidney disease patients,1661,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Cara Therapeutics's (CARA.O) drug to treat moderate-to-severe itching in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, making it the first therapy for the ailment in the United States. The company expects to commercially launch the injection, Korsuva, in the first quarter of 2022, Chief Executive Officer Derek Chalmers said in an interview. The drug is designed to be administered three times a week after each dialysis. It reduces the activity of the sensory nerve that relays itching from the skin to the spinal cord and subsequently to the brain. Chronic kidney disease patients with severe itching currently take depressants such as barbiturates and allergy medication antihistamines. Cara's shares were unchanged after the bell, having gained about 4% in regular trading on Monday. The company has an exclusive license agreement with Switzerland-based Vifor Pharma for Korsuva, under which it would earn 60% of the profit on U.S. sales. Cara said it could price the drug similar to the $17,000 annual cost of Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) treatment Parsabiv, which treats secondary hyperparathyroidism, or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, in kidney disease patients. Jefferies analyst Christopher Howerton estimates Korsuva will generate peak sales of about $900 million in 2030. Cara has also filed for marketing approval with the European Medicines Agency, whose decision is due in the second quarter of 2022. It is also developing an oral form of Korsuva in five different conditions, including atopic dermatitis. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thailand to receive 61 mln doses of AstraZeneca vaccine this year,1819,"BANGKOK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Thailand will receive 61 million doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine this year, a government spokesperson said on Monday, as the Southeast Asian country rushes to vaccinate its population amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Thailand is AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing hub for the region, but has been slow to obtain enough shots to inoculate its population. About 9% of Thailand's 66 million people have been fully vaccinated. ""This is good news, it will help create herd immunity faster. This will take pressure off the health care system, help people return to their normal lives and speed up economic recovery,"" government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said in a statement. Last month, health officials said that AstraZeneca had asked to delay deliveries of its order of 61 million doses to May 2022. read more The news that the doses would arrive sooner than expected followed a meeting between Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, and AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot, Anucha Burapachaisri said. The delivery would bring Thailand's total vaccine supply for 2021 to over 120 million doses, of which 61 million from AstraZeneca and a combination of 30 million doses of China's Sinovac and 30 million from Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE). Thailand will buy an additional 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine next year, Anucha added. Thailand has reported 1,066,786 coronavirus infections and 9,562 deaths since the pandemic began. Over 97% of those cases and deaths have been detected since April this year. In addition to buying more AstraZeneca vaccines, Thailand also has plans to 50 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 2022, according to the health ministry.

Researchers seek powerful antibody against many variants; breakthrough cases may be less infectious,3997,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Here is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Researchers working toward one vaccine for many variants Two separate research teams last week reported on laboratory tests of monoclonal antibodies that appear to protect against a broad range of COVID-19 virus variants. One study, published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, identified ""high-level, broad-spectrum"" antibodies in blood samples from survivors of the original SARS outbreak in 2003 who recently received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In test tube experiments, some of the SARS survivors' antibodies induced by the vaccine could neutralize not only all of the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, but also five viruses that have been identified in bats and pangolins and that have the potential to cause human infection. In a separate study, published on Thursday in the journal Immunity, another research team describes an antibody that was highly protective at low doses against a wide range of COVID-19-causing variants in mice. ""The antibody attaches to a part of the virus that differs little across the variants, meaning that it is unlikely for resistance to arise at this spot,"" the authors said. The findings from these studies could be a step toward developing new antibodies that would be effective against multiple different coronaviruses, the two teams say. Infectious virus shedding may be lower in breakthrough cases Vaccinated people who get infected with COVID-19 have high levels of the virus in their noses and throats but not all of that virus is infectious, a new study suggests. Among 24,706 vaccinated healthcare workers in The Netherlands, 161 developed mild or asymptomatic breakthrough infections, mostly due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The viral levels on nose-and-throat swab samples from these patients were just as high as in unvaccinated healthcare workers who were infected last year with the original strain of the virus. But in test tube experiments, the virus from vaccinated patients was less efficient at reproducing itself than virus from unvaccinated patients, probably because some of it had been neutralized by antibodies from the vaccine, the researchers speculate. In a report posted on medRxiv on Saturday ahead of peer review, they conclude that shedding of infectious virus is reduced in breakthrough cases, although patients are still contagious. Antibodies fade faster after vaccine vs actual infection Protective antibody levels decline faster in recipients of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech than in COVID-19 survivors, according to doctors at one of Israel's largest HMOs. They tracked antibody levels in 2,653 adults who received two doses of the vaccine and in 4,361 COVID-19 survivors who were never vaccinated. Antibody levels fell by up to 40% per month in vaccinated participants, versus less than 5% per month in so-called convalescents. After six months, about 84% of vaccine recipients still had detectable antibodies, whereas roughly 90% of convalescents still had detectable antibodies after nine months. Dr. Ariel Israel of Leumit Health Services, coauthor of a reported posted on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, noted that antibodies are not the immune system's only weapon against the virus. Still, he said, the data suggests that antibody protection in Pfizer vaccine recipients wanes at a higher rate than in COVID-19 survivors. Leumit researchers had previously reported that breakthrough infection rates increase starting about five months after vaccination. Dr. Israel said the combined data argues for a booster shot five months after the second injection, especially for high-risk individuals. Click for a Reuters graphic on vaccines in development.

"Illumina-Grail deal heads to FTC trial, as EU weighs penalty",3552,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Lawyers for Illumina Inc are set to defend the life sciences company's $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, as European antitrust regulators assail the company for closing the deal without first securing regulatory approval. D. Michael Chappell, chief administrative law judge at the FTC, is presiding over the trial, which could run until early October. He met virtually with the lawyers in the case on Monday for more than an hour to set the contours and expectations of the trial. The companies closed their deal last week, despite the FTC's challenge to San Diego, California-based Illumina's tie-up with the cancer-detection test maker and an EU probe that opened in June. EU officials said on Friday they ""deeply regret"" Illumina's decision to move ahead while its investigation was still ongoing. The FTC has not commented. Illumina said last week there was no ""legal impediment"" to closing the deal and that it would hold Grail as a separate company amid European Commission review. Grail, based in Menlo Park, California, relies on Illumina's DNA sequencing technology for its tests. FTC lawyers, in the agency's challenge lodged in March, asserted the combination of the companies would hurt test-detection innovation and drive up prices. Illumina's chief executive saidat the time that the acquisition ""provides huge benefits to people who may have cancer and don't know it."" Cravath, Swaine & Moore litigation partner David Marriott is set to deliver the opening for Illumina, and Latham & Watkins partner Al Pfeiffer, a former co-chairman of the firm's antitrust practice, is prepared to speak for Grail. The Cravath team includes Christine Varney, a former Obama-era head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Marriott and Pfeiffer did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Monday. Crowell & Moring antitrust partner Alexis Gilman in Washington said the case is being closely watched as ""the first vertical merger case that the FTC has litigated in decades."" The parties, he said, had offered ""fairly robust commitments to address potential concerns,"" including an effort to hold and lower prices on sequencing products. Each side will get up to two hours to make an opening statement. ""Two hours is a limit, not a goal,"" Chappell said on Monday. Chappell also warned that ""expert witnesses are not allowed to run wild in this courtroom."" FTC senior trial counsel Susan Musser, who joined the agency in May 2020 from Hogan Lovells, where she was an associate, is set to deliver the government's opening statement. A handful of Big Law firms are representing non-party clients that provided documents in response to subpoenas issued earlier in the case, according to filings in recent weeks that sought some protection for featuring confidential or proprietary information. Sidley Austin and DLA Piper lawyers lobbied in the U.S. Congress in support of Illumina's deal with Grail, disclosures showed. The case is In the Matter of Illumina Inc and Grail Inc, Federal Trade Commission Office of Administrative Law Judges, Docket No. 9401.

Fed's Jackson Hole shift shows Delta variant's ability to skew plans,4205,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Health officials in Teton County, Wyoming, announced last Thursday what was in part an administrative change, swapping a local five-point index for assessing COVID-19 risk for a four-point scale used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that change promptly pushed the county into the CDC's highest risk category, and shifted the Federal Reserve's plans to hold its Jackson Hole central banking conference as an in-person event into non-compliance with local health guidance. Within a day, the U.S. central bank had cancelled the in-person portion of the conference at the local mountain resort. The annual symposium, organized by the Kansas City Fed, will still take place online and the substance will be the same. Academic research papers will be presented and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a speech via webcast on Friday. Yet the sequence of events last week shows the day-to-day recalibration underway over what is and isn't safe during the current U.S. COVID-19 surge, which is being fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. The Fed's reaction to a county government's communication choices served as a high-profile example of how the pace of the economic recovery is being reshaped. The decision certainly diminished public health risks. The guest list for the Fed's Jackson Hole event had already been pared perhaps by half from a typical year's crowd of around 150, COVID-19 vaccination was mandatory, and masks required indoors. The cancellation further eliminated travel and two days of in-person sessions, meals and receptions, as well as a typically large slate of sidebar meetings. It also meant dozens of canceled plane trips, rental cars and hotel rooms for the attendees, their family members or guests, an entourage of press, and others, and refunds of the $1,100 conference fee. That occurred even though nothing much had changed between the start of the week, when Fed officials were nailing down last-minute plans, and late Friday afternoon, when Kansas City Fed officials called off the in-person gathering ""due to the recently elevated COVID-19 health risk level in Teton County, Wyoming."" Per capita case rates had continued upward, but a dramatic spike in Teton County infections had begun in mid-July and was well underway by the start of August. What was different was the scale used by county officials to assess the risk. In the CDC's streamlined index, Teton County was now at the red, or highest, level. In fact, the Atlanta-based health agency moved the county's risk level to ""high"" on July 22, according to its online data for Teton County. The local guidance for that risk level discouraged gatherings outside of immediate family members. 'LOT OF CANCELLATIONS' The Kansas City Fed had said in May, when it announced it was returning to an in-person conference after moving the annual gathering online last year, that it would ""adhere to all health and safety guidelines that are in place at the time of the program."" A Kansas city Fed official said the regional bank has been monitoring the Teton County health department's website and made the decision to announce the shift after the close of markets on Friday based on the change of status. Under the county's prior index, which included a broader set of considerations such as hospital admissions, supplies of protective equipment, and the availability of testing, the risk level also would have been changed last week from moderate to high, said Jodie Pond, the county's health director. The local guidance for that risk level under the prior system, however, did not recommend family-only gatherings, a suggestion reserved for the county's highest ""critical"" risk stage. ""There have been a lot of cancellations of events and that was not our goal, to cancel events if they could be done safely,"" Pond said of the recent change. ""I don't want to second-guess an event organizer because I am always going to err on the side of canceling, to err on the side of caution ... I would say it is probably okay - nobody asked us - if people were masked indoors and required to be vaccinated."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
ADA suit over MTA elevator-outages back on track – 2nd Circuit,4292,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - New York City subway riders with disabilities won another chance to show that peak-hour elevator breakdowns at high-volume stations deprive them of meaningful access to the transportation system, thanks to a federal appeals court decision Monday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated a certified class action filed in 2017 by lawyers at Disability Rights Advocates and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton on behalf of three individuals and six nonprofit organizations, who say the system is shirking its duty to perform regular maintenance on the elevators. A lower court granted summary judgment for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York City Transit Authority (referred to collectively as MTA), represented by Hoguet Newman Regal & Kenney, based on MTA’s undisputed evidence that, system-wide, elevators at ADA-accessible stations were operational at least 96.5 percent of the time. However, “averages can obscure variables,” and the plaintiffs had raised “a reasonable inference that, for some, access is not meaningful (assuming no accommodations),” Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote for the 2nd Circuit. The plaintiffs’ evidence showed an outage rate of 8 percent to 15 percent at high-volume stations during peak hours; and, since getting to the desired platform can require up to four elevator rides, a daily commuter’s chance of encountering an “out-of-service” sign could be 50 percent or more. The district court “erred by declining to separately consider such riders,” Jacobs wrote, joined by Circuit Judges Jose Cabranes and Steven Menashi. Counsel for the transit authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Emily Seelenfreund of Disability Rights Advocates said her clients “appreciate the recognition … that the ‘meaningful access’ inquiry demands an examination of the impact of outages on real people's travel in the context of the system as a whole, as well as looking at the accommodations available during these frequent, unplanned outages.” While fewer than one-fourth of the MTA’s 472 stations are ADA-accessible, the elevator-outage lawsuit concerns only those that are. The plaintiffs are a class led by Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, Chris Pangilinan and Dustin Jones, and nonprofits Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled; Bronx Independent Living Services; Harlem Independent Living Center; Center for Independence of the Disabled; Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York; and New York Statewide Senior Action Council. They alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the New York City Human Rights Law. They drew amicus support from The National Disability Rights Network, TransitCenter, and Up-Stand. On remand, the MTA can still prevail if it establishes that it offers reasonable accommodations to riders with disabilities when elevator outages prevent them from accessing their trains. Both sides had offered evidence about accommodations, with the MTA relying primarily on its extensive and fully accessible bus-service network. U.S. District Judge George Daniels had questioned whether a bus could be viewed as an “accommodation” for a subway train; however, he found it unnecessary to decide because he found no denial of subway service. The 2nd Circuit said a bus is “an” accommodation - since, like the subway, “it is a means of getting from here to there” – but said the question of whether bus service is a reasonable accommodation is a factual question to be decided on remand. The case is Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled et al. v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City Transit Authority et al., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1433.

Purdue Pharma judge says Sacklers face 'substantial risk' of liability,2458,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy said on Monday that some members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker face a “substantial risk” of liability and could be on the hook for ""huge amounts of money"" over claims the company fueled the opioid epidemic. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made the remark during closing arguments in a trial over Purdue’s proposed reorganization plan. ""I think there is substantial risk that the Sacklers, or some of them, could be liable for huge amounts of money,"" said Drain, who added that “the question is where you draw the line.” Under the deal, which Purdue says is worth more than $10 billion, the Sacklers would contribute about $4.5 billion and receive legal protections against future opioid-related litigation. Drain did not explicitly state which way he will rule but suggested he finds the deal was sufficient. But he urged lawyers for the Sacklers and the nine states that oppose the deal to continue settlement talks over next couple of days. More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drain told Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Fogelman that it would be ""boneheaded"" to reject billions of dollars from the Sacklers just because it is not enough to solve the entire U.S. opioid crisis. The judge is expected to issue a formal ruling on the deal this week. The money would go toward various entities and private individuals with opioid claims, as well as state and local opioid abatement programs. Critics of the settlement argue that the liability releases are too broad. An attorney representing the states of Washington and Oregon, which oppose the plan, told Drain on Monday that approving the deal would be a “historic mistake.” The judge also stated that appeals courts generally support the types of releases the Sacklers would receive if they meet certain standards. At the outset of Monday’s hearing, a lawyer for the Sacklers said they had agreed to narrow the litigation releases to exclude protections for the family against non-opioid-related claims. But the crux of the releases, shielding the Sacklers against opioid-related litigation, remains intact. During testimony last week, members of the Sackler family said they would not contribute if they do not receive the releases. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. energy firms launching employee COVID-19 vaccination mandates,2509,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies are moving to require that employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations as infection rates rise across the United States and health surveys show that energy workers remain among those most reluctant to get inoculations. Calls to require vaccinations for employees working at close quarters in oilfield and refinery operations came as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. read more The second-largest U.S. oil producer, Chevron Corp (CVX.N), and refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) will require jabs for certain field workers or new workers, while leading Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) is requiring newly hired employees to be fully vaccinated before their first day of work, according to a job posting. A spokesperson for Pioneer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger (SLB.N) said last week some customers were requesting that its staff be vaccinated or tested before arriving on job sites. ""We continuously review our internal policies and procedures to ensure that we can meet our customers’ needs while prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees,"" a Schlumberger spokeswoman said in an email. This month, San Antonio-based Valero became the first U.S. refiner to require vaccinations as a condition of employment for new workers at Texas and Louisiana refineries. Oil producer Hess (HES.N) said it will require workers at U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1. In a statement, the company pointed to the ""highly infectious nature"" of the Delta variant and rising number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Energy and construction workers have some of the lowest vaccine uptake rates, according to an online survey led by Wendy King, an associate epidemiology professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. Some 45% of extraction and construction workers said they were hesitant to get the vaccine, versus just 7.3% in the computer and mathematical professions, the May survey showed. Chevron's mandate will cover offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico, some onshore support staff, expatriates and employees who travel internationally, a spokeswoman said in an email. This month, Chevron postponed a full return of office employees in California and Texas because of a resurgence in cases related to the Delta variant. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Wall Street gains, Nasdaq notches record closing high on full vaccine approval",3221,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Monday, and the Nasdaq reached an all-time closing high as sentiment was boosted by full FDA approval of a COVID-19 vaccine and market participants looked ahead to the Jackson Hole Symposium expected to convene later this week. All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session sharply higher, with the S&P 500 in the session's final minutes just failing to hold what would have been a record-high close. Surging crude prices, driven by expected demand growth, putting energy shares out front. ""This has been the script all along,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""We make new highs, pull back, and then we’re off to the races again."" ""That tells me the fundamentals are in place,"" Cardillo added. ""There’s worries out there, but it’s hard to keep this market down."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech in a move that could accelerate inoculations in the United States. ""Full approval means that there’s most likely going to be more mandates, more companies will mandate that you have to get the vaccine in order to get back to the office,"" Cardillo said. ""I don’t think this will get all the doubters vaccinated but this news today will probably drive (the vaccinated rate) closer to 75%."" Pfizer and U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech advanced 2.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Rival Moderna Inc gained 7.5%. Spiking COVID-19 infections caused by the highly contagious Delta variant have fueled concerns over a protracted recovery from the global health crisis. Data released on Monday painted a ""Goldilocks"" portrait of an economic recovery headed in the right direction, but not enough to warrant a change in the Federal Reserve's dovish monetary policy, which helped feed investor risk appetite. Market participants look to the Jackson Hole Symposium, due to convene in Wyoming later this week.

New York City mandates COVID-19 vaccine for teachers in largest U.S. school district,4499,"NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - New York City will require public school teachers and staff to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday, part of a push to get more residents inoculated and slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. All 148,000 staff members in the largest U.S. school district must get at least one dose of a vaccine by Sept. 27 as part of the mandate, de Blasio said. In a first for city employees, Department of Education staff will no longer have the option to submit to weekly testing instead. U.S. educators and parents have been grappling with how to keep schools safe and open as the country battles another coronavirus surge just as students head back to the classroom. New York joins Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington state in introducing vaccine mandates for teachers and school staff. ""We want our schools to be extraordinarily safe all year long,"" de Blasio told a news conference. School is set to begin in New York City on Sept. 13. Elsewhere in the country, thousands of children returned to classrooms on Monday. In Springfield, Virginia, Christy Hudson, 43, said she ""breathed a huge sigh of relief"" on Monday morning when her son, a high school sophomore, boarded his bus to attend class in person after getting remote instruction all of the last school year. ""I'm cautiously optimistic, but there's still quite a lot of uncertainty,"" Hudson said. ""There are going to be positive cases, certainly, but how will the school react to that?"" PFIZER GETS FDA NOD The announcement in New York City followed news on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE <(22UAy.DE)> COVID-19 vaccine. Shortly after the FDA's announcement, the Pentagon said it was preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for U.S. military personnel. read more Registered nurse Sheba Phillip prepares a syringe with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), during a vaccination event for local adolescents and adults outside the Bronx Writing Academy school in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 4, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Segar U.S. health officials expect that the agency's full approval also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Monday that city employees would be required to be vaccinated, but did not specify when the mandate would go into effect. ""It's for the safety of all involved, particularly members of the public who are interacting with city employees on a daily basis. It's important for colleagues to also feel like they have a workplace that's safe,"" she told a news conference. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Monday that all state employees, including educators, would be required to get vaccinated or get tested ""at a minimum of once to twice each week."" Earlier this month, New York City required proof of COVID-19 vaccination at restaurants, gyms and other businesses. The mandate sparked backlash from some business owners and residents who sued de Blasio. The latest mandate also could face resistance from unions representing New York City teachers and staff. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), said the union's priority was to keep children safe and school open. But he added in a statement that ""there are many implementation details, including provisions for medical exceptions, that by law must be negotiated with the UFT and other unions, and if necessary, resolved by arbitration."" Meisha Porter, chancellor of New York City's public schools, said at least 63% of employees were already vaccinated against COVID-19. Efforts to increase vaccination rates and implement public safety measures like mask wearing in schools have faced staunch opposition in some parts of the country, especially in some Southern states that have been hard hit by the Delta variant. In Florida, some school districts now face the potential loss of some public funding because they mandated masks in defiance of a ban on that step by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is another Republican who has acted to block local officials from mandating face coverings. He was dealt a setback late last week when the state's Supreme Court temporarily allowed schools to keep mask mandates in place. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. report finds multiple problems with Keystone pipeline,2539,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog found multiple problems with the construction, manufacture and design of the Keystone pipeline, validating President Joe Biden's decision to revoke the permit for a Keystone XL extension, leaders of several House Democratic committees said on Monday. The lawmakers requested the Government Accountability Office report in November 2019 after more than 11,000 barrels of oil leaked from the pipeline system in two releases in less than two years. ""GAO found that preventable construction issues contributed to the current Keystone pipeline’s spills more frequently than the industry-wide trends,"" they said in a statement. Keystone's four largest spills were ""caused by issues related to the original design, manufacturing of the pipe, or construction of the pipeline,"" the GAO report said. Biden canceled Keystone XL's permit on his first day in office on Jan. 20, dealing a death blow to a project that would have carried 830,000 barrels per day of heavy oil sands crude from Alberta to Nebraska. L1N2JX1D8 ""TC Energy’s record among its peers is one of the worst in terms of volume of oil spilled per mile transported,"" a statement from the lawmakers said. The lawmakers included Representative Frank Pallone, energy and commerce committee chair. TC Energy Corp (TRP.TO) officially canceled the $9 billion Keystone XL in June. It filed a notice of intent in July to begin a legacy North American Free Trade Agreement claim and is seeking more than $15 billion in damages from the U.S. government. The company said in response to the report it has had ""zero high-impact incidents in 18 months,"" after taking measures to strengthen safety and prevent incidents. Pipeline opponents want to slow the movement of Canadian oil to the United States. But pipeline supporters say it will be shipped anyway and that oil sent by rail has caused numerous fiery accidents. Biden ""was clearly right to question this operator’s ability to construct a safe and resilient pipeline, and we support his decision to put Americans’ health and environment above industry interests,” the U.S. representatives said.

The vaccine requirement will also cover fitness studios along with sporting events, concerts, weddings and other private and public indoor social events, health officials said. British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, is reporting some of the country's highest rates of new COVID-19 cases per capita and recently mandated vaccines for staff of long-term care homes. The province reported 663 new cases on Friday, the most recent data available. read more People wanting to enter a non-essential business must have at least one dose of vaccine starting Sept. 13 and both doses by Oct. 24, Premier John Horgan said. ""There's no reason those who are anxious to participate in the social and economic life of our community can't take that next step and get that safe, effective vaccine,"" Horgan told reporters. Quebec was the first province to bring in vaccine passports for non-essential businesses earlier in August. Vaccine mandates are becoming an election issue in Canada's ongoing federal election, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered on Aug. 15.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine gains full U.S. regulatory approval,4956,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc(PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine - the first to secure such Food and Drug Administration validation - prompting President Joe Biden to make a fresh pitch to vaccine skeptics to get the shot to fight the relentless pandemic. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review. Public health officials hope the action will convince unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. Speaking at the White House, Biden called the FDA approval ""an important moment in our fight against the pandemic"" and urged more private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. ""If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened,"" Biden said. ""It's time for you to go get your vaccination. Get it today,"" Biden added. ""... There is no time to waste."" The Pentagon said it is preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for military personnel. U.S. health officials expect that the FDA's action also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. New York City said it will require vaccines for public-school teachers, while New Jersey announced that all state workers must get vaccinated by mid-October or agree to regular COVID-19 tests. ""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated,"" said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner. More than 204 million people in the United States have received the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA's approval extends the shelf life of Pfizer shots from six months to nine months. It also confirms that the vaccine increases risk of heart inflammation, particularly among young men in the week following their second shot. The approval makes it easier for doctors to prescribe a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine off-label for people who may benefit from additional protection against COVID-19. Pfizer shares closed up around 2.5% and BioNTech shares gained more than 9.5%. The two other COVID-19 vaccines given emergency-use authorization - made by Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) - have not yet received full FDA approval. The FDA gave emergency-use authorization to Pfizer's vaccine for people age 16 and older in December - the first shot to gain such backing in the United States - and provided further emergency-use authorization for people age 12 and up in May. SHOTS FOR CHILDREN Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to apply for full approval in children ages 12 to 15 as soon as required data is available. Woodcock said the FDA is not recommending that children under age 12 get the vaccine now because it needs to ensure it is safe for them, telling reporters it ""would be a great concern if people vaccinate children because we don't have the proper data."" Pfizer is expected to submit data this fall to support the shot's emergency-use authorization for children under 12 based on smaller doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics, representing children's doctors, discouraged having children under 12 receive the vaccine. Pfizer's shot has received conditional regulatory approval elsewhere including Britain and the European Union. The United States leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. More than 625,000 Americans have died, including an average of more than 600 daily in recent weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71% of Americans age 12 and older - the population eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines - have gotten at least one dose and 60.2% are fully vaccinated. For the entire population, including children up to age 11 for whom no vaccines are yet approved, 60.7% of Americans have received at least one dose, with 51.5% fully vaccinated. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement the FDA's approval ""affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed.""

"Equities gain, U.S. dollar falls; Fed seen less eager to taper",3215,"NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose while the U.S. dollar dipped on Monday as investors grew less concerned that the Federal Reserve would soon begin changing its accommodative monetary stance. Market sentiment was buoyed after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine. New cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. L4N2PU36O The dollar index slid.

Biden administration defends eviction ban at U.S. Supreme Court,1386,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to leave in place a COVID-19 pandemic-related federal ban on residential evictions while the justices consider a challenge by landlord groups to the ban's legality. In a court filing, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acted within its lawful authority this month when it renewed the moratorium through Oct. 3 after it had lapsed at the end of July. Groups representing landlords have sought to lift the moratorium, pointing out that even Biden administration officials have conceded it may not be lawful. The CDC first issued an eviction moratorium in September 2020, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic. Realtor groups in Alabama and Georgia were among those challenging the moratorium. Under heavy political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration on Aug. 3 issued a slightly narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Biden initially had said that congressional action was needed to renew the moratorium, but his administration reversed course. The current moratorium, due to expire in October, covers nearly 92% of U.S. counties, but that could change based on COVID-19 conditions."
U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocks reinstatement of Trump-era immigration policy,2386,"WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A U.S. Supreme Court justice on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would require Democratic President Joe Biden to reinstate a contentious immigration policy implemented by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. The brief order by conservative Justice Samuel Alito puts the litigation on hold while the high court considers how to handle the Biden administration's request seeking to impose a longer-term block on the judge's ruling that would require the government to revive the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. The Biden administration turned to the Supreme Court after the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late on Thursday denied a government request to delay the effective date of the lower court judge's ruling a week earlier. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ""requires the government to abruptly reinstate a broad and controversial immigration enforcement program that has been formally suspended for seven months and largely dormant for nearly nine months before that,"" Acting Solicitor General Brian Fletcher wrote in papers to the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Trump. The Justice Department wants the court to act immediately, with the judge's injunction due to go into effect on Saturday. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized MPP, informally known as ""remain in Mexico,"" saying it subjected mostly Central American migrants to unsanitary conditions and violence. Arrests of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border have reached 20-year highs in recent months, a trend Republicans pin on Biden's reversal of MPP and other hardline Trump immigration policies. The Biden administration has left in place a Trump-era health order that allows border authorities to expel migrants to Mexico without the chance to seek asylum in the United States. The ruling by the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit said the Biden administration must implement the MPP program in ""good faith,"" which appears to leave the government some discretion in how to move forward. Roberto Velasco, a senior Mexican foreign ministry official responsible for North American relations, said Mexico had not yet received any notification from the U.S. government about the ruling.

Germany drops incidence levels as key COVID yardstick,1704,"BERLIN, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Germany has decided to stop using the coronavirus infection rate as its yardstick for deciding if restrictions should be in force to contain the spread of the virus, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. The seven-day incidence rate was a key measure in determining whether restrictions could be imposed or lifted, with infection thresholds of 35, 50 and 100 per 100,000 people triggering the opening or closure of different parts of society. But as the number of people who are fully vaccinated rises, calls have grown for the incidence rate to be dropped as a measure to determine whether lockdowns are necessary. ""We decided today that we no longer need comprehensive protective measures when the number of cases or incidence is 50, because a large proportion of the people are vaccinated,"" Merkel said. The government and federal states will instead monitor hospitalisations as a key indicator for whether the health system is becoming overburdened, Merkel said. Merkel added Berlin would discuss how to define the new measure in talks in the coming weeks with the 16 state premiers, who are in charge of health policies. Germany reported 3,668 new coronavirus infections on Monday and a seven-day incidence rate of 56.4, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. Some 59% of the population are full-vaccinated with around 64% having received at least one dose. Merkel said more Germans should get vaccinated now to protect the health system from being overwhelmed during a possible fourth wave of infections later in the year. ""Our vaccination rate is not high enough yet,"" the chancellor said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Why ASU can’t block ‘odious’ anti-mask Instagrammer who touted ‘Hoax-19’ parties,7615,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sometimes, even vulgar, anonymous bullies who claim COVID is a hoax and casually compare mask mandates to Nazism deserve to win. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Phoenix denied a default judgment motion by the board of regents for Arizona State University. ASU wanted a permanent injunction to bar an Instagram account called asu_covid.parties from using the university's trademarks or school colors in posts encouraging ASU students to attend mask-less “COVID parties."" U.S. District Judge Dominic Lanza said he understood that ASU was trying to combat the pandemic when it brought trademark claims against the anonymous Instagrammer, who claimed to be an ASU student and displayed ASU’s logo in a post proclaiming, “No more social distancing. No more masks. It is time to party.” But Lanza said the university’s novel use of trademark law wasn’t the right means to that end. ASU alleged that the anonymous Instagrammer, called John Doe in its complaint, was abusing its trademarks to sow confusion and conflict about the school's COVID policies. The judge said those claims didn’t hold up because no reasonable person would be deceived by Doe’s use of the university’s logo and school colors. Doe’s language – his first post promised, “We about to get fucking lit,” for instance – belied any official affiliation with the school, the judge said. And Doe’s posts relentlessly criticized ASU's masking and social distancing policies – hardly a stance that would be taken by an official ASU account. Doe even referred more than once to ASU president Michael Crow as ""Fuhrer."" “Many things can be said about these offensive and outrageous statements,” Lanza wrote, “but it is not plausible (to put it mildly) that a reasonably prudent consumer would believe ASU was the source or origin of them.” I doubt Lanza’s decision will have much practical effect. Instagram’s parent, Facebook, Inc, agreed to block the Doe’s asu_covid.parties account after ASU named the company in its initial complaint. (The university dropped Facebook as a defendant after the shutdown.) Doe subsequently tried to launch a new account, asu_covid.parties2, but, according to an ASU filing, Facebook disabled that one as well. It appears that Instagram is no longer an outlet for Doe. It's nevertheless worth crediting Lanza for the careful consideration he gave to ASU’s claims. It would have been easy, after all, for the judge simply to side with ASU against a defendant he considered to be a “deeply unsympathetic” author of “odious” posts. Doe’s conduct in the litigation certainly didn’t curry favor with the judge. ASU filed its initial complaint in August 2020. A few days later, Doe sent an email to ASU counsel Glenn Bacal and Sean Garrison of Bacal & Garrison Law Group. “I heard in the news that you guys are trying to sue me,” the profanity-laced email said. “Withdraw your complaint or I will file a Rule 11 motion for sanctions....I am extremely experienced and outrageously vexatious.” Doe actually showed up in the docket with an answer to ASU’s complaint and a request to use the court’s electronic filing system. (Doe supplied only an email address but said, “I have used ECF filing many, many times before and know how it works.”) The filing was rife with insults for ASU’s lawyers and Nazi references for ASU officials. More substantively, though, Doe claimed First Amendment protection for the Instagram account. The posts were “clearly a parody,” Doe said. “The 1st Amendment allows me to be as offensive as I want to be. So suck it!"" Some of Doe’s posts do have a satiric tinge, like the post claiming that a big unmasked party for ASU students would be hosted at the consulate of Belarus so it couldn’t be shut down by police; and the post thanking Israel and Teva Pharmaceuticals for agreeing to use proceeds of the party to distribute “hydrochloroquine” around the world. Others, though, just seem angry, like Doe’s penultimate post: “No working out without a mask even though that’s more likely to hurt you than the chance of catching COVID-19. No frat parties. No Trump rallies but protesting BLM is okay. No singing in church. No clubbing.’ Fuck Führer Crow. We are going to party.” Whatever Doe’s intent, Lanza struck the answer to ASU’s complaint because it was “filled with obscenities, inflammatory language and insults directed toward ASU and its counsel.” The judge ordered Doe to file a revised response without curse words and gratuitous vituperation. He also instructed Doe to file a motion explaining why he or she is entitled to continue litigating anonymously. (Doe’s answer cited the First Amendment but Lanza said that was an insufficient justification.) Doe never made another filing in the case. (It’s ironic, in a way, that a purported anti-mask advocate would refuse to remove the electronic mask hiding his or her true identity.) Lanza granted ASU’s motion for discovery to find out who Doe is, but the university’s motion last April for a default judgment, which outlined why such judgments can be entered against anonymous defendants, implied that Doe’s identity remains unknown. I sent an email to the address Doe listed in the ECF application but did not receive a response. In an emailed statement, the university said it disagreed with Lanza's conclusion but appreciated his recognition of Doe's ""odious"" behavior. ""ASU’s concern for the health of its students and the greater university community necessitated this lawsuit,"" the statement said. ""As a practical matter, the university achieved its primary objective -- the offending Instagram account was shut down just as soon as the lawsuit was filed, preventing any further possible confusion among the university community and the general public about whether ASU sponsored or otherwise condoned such reckless behavior as Covid parties."" I am certain that Doe never actually held a party for ASU students at the Belarusian consulate in Arizona, since, among other things, there is no Belarusian consulate in Arizona. Doe's Instagram account was still a headache for ASU. Doe may have intended asu_covid.parties to be satiric – if you give Doe the benefit of very serious doubts on that point – but lots of people who read Doe’s posts didn’t get the joke. You can understand why ASU resorted to a trademark claim to shut Doe down. But as I said above, sometimes the most obnoxious litigants still deserve to win, even if they don’t even bother to show up.

QUOTEBOX Reactions to U.S. FDA's full approval of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,3921,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE became the first to secure full approval from the U.S Food and Drug Administration on Monday, a move that is expected to help health authorities struggling to win over vaccine skeptics. read more Following are a few comments from the President of the United States and public health experts: U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (on Twitter) ""The FDA has officially approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. While all three COVID vaccines have met FDA's strict standards for emergency use, this FDA approval should give added confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective."" ""If you're not vaccinated yet, now is the time."" BARBARA ALEXANDER, PRESIDENT, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA ""Full FDA approval strengthens the case for vaccination requirements as an important strategy to curb infection and prevent hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. The most important takeaway from today's announcement is to get vaccinated."" JESSE GOODMAN, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY & FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIST AT FDA ""I know some people are concerned that vaccines, including this one, can have adverse effects. What FDA is really saying is that the benefits far outweigh any risks."" ""The approval also allows doctors to legally prescribe additional doses of the vaccine to their patients, which some doctors have already been doing."" ""Some of these prescribing decisions may be appropriate, but I think it is really incumbent upon the FDA and the CDC and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to provide really good and strong guidelines while we're still learning more about things like combinations of different vaccines."" ERIC TOPOL, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR OF THE SCRIPPS RESEARCH TRANSLATIONAL INSTITUTE ""Some companies, the military and some health systems did go ahead with mandates, but not nearly as many as will go forward now. Many large employers will go ahead and require vaccination because they were waiting for the magic word of full approval instead of emergency use authorization."" ""It will help many who are hesitant. Obviously, there was a large proportion of Americans who were concerned when it was viewed as an emergency, rather than a fully blessed, sanctioned, approved vaccine. I think that at both levels, there will be a surge of vaccinations in the weeks ahead."" AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ""While this (the approval for use in people aged 16 and above) means it is legally permissible for physicians to administer the vaccine off-label for children aged 11 and younger, who currently have no available vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly discourages that practice."" ""The clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 11 years old and younger are underway, and we need to see the data from those studies before we give this vaccine to younger children"" AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ""Today's news marks a critical moment for people who were concerned about getting vaccinated due to the vaccines being authorized for emergency use. FDA approval also should further reinforce efforts in the health care field to urge vaccination, and to deploy all reasonable tools to achieve high levels of vaccination, including mandatory vaccination policies"" PAUL OFFIT, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, MEMBER OF FDA'S VACCINE ADVISORY PANEL ""What the FDA has now said is that the vaccine that they have basically licensed not just the product, but also the manufacturing site and the process by which the product is made."" DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS/MÉDECINS SANS FRONTIÈRES (MSF) ""Following today's approval, MSF is calling on Pfizer and BioNTech to share the vaccine technology and knowledge with manufacturers on the African continent that could help boost the global supply.

France's COVID-19 hospitalisations highest in 2 months,1428,"PARIS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - French health authorities said on Monday the number of people hospitalised for COVID-19 and those treated in intensive care units (ICU) stood at the highest levels in more than two months, as the Delta variant of the disease has put a renewed strain on the health system. The daily new infections increased by 5,166 over 24 hours, but were down by 11.4% versus last Monday. And the seven-day moving average of daily additional cases decreased to 21,130 versus 23,783 10 days ago. ""Regarding ICU patients, the peak of this fourth wave could be reached in the days to come"", Health Minister Olivier Veran told BFM, adding he remained wary of a possible back-to-school effect in a week's time. He also said France's main independent health authority would soon recommend a third COVID-19 for those older than 65 years. The number of people hospitalised for the virus rose by 356 over 24 hours to 11,007, the first time the figure exceeded 11,000 since June 17. Patients treated in intensive care units for the disease increased by 87 to 2,215, the highest since June 10. The COVID-19 death toll went up by 108, at 113,496 - the 11th-highest in the world - with the seven day moving average at an almost three-months high of 109. At more than 6.6 million cases since the outbreak of the disease, France has the fifth-highest total of infection globally. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pentagon set to make Pfizer vaccine mandatory after FDA approval,2342,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Pentagon is preparing to issue updated guidance to require all U.S. service personnel to be vaccinated after Monday's approval of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. Kirby told a briefing the completion date for vaccine guidance was still being worked on. The FDA granted full approval on Monday to the vaccine, which had earned emergency-use authorization in December, making it the first to secure such validation as U.S. health authorities struggle to win over vaccine skeptics. Asked if similar guidance could be given for other COVID-19 vaccines, Kirby replied: ""Right now we're focused on the Pfizer vaccine because of the FDA approval that came in this morning."" The Pentagon said this month it would seek President Joe Biden's approval by mid-September to require 1.3 million military members to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A syringe is filled with a dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine at a pop-up community vaccination center at the Gateway World Christian Center in Valley Stream, New York, U.S., February 23, 2021. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo After setting COVID-19 rules for federal workers, Biden last month directed the Pentagon to look into ""how and when"" it would require members of the military to take the vaccine. Biden said then he strongly supported the Pentagon's plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for service members by mid-September. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the deadline could be moved up if the FDA approved the vaccine earlier. The U.S. military said this month that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members. Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. About 73% of sailors are fully vaccinated, compared with the U.S. national average of about 60% of adults ages 18 and over. Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19 - just 28 in total, according to Pentagon data.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine wins full U.S. FDA approval,4884,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine making it the first to secure such Food and Drug Administration validation as health authorities struggle to win over vaccine skeptics during a relentless pandemic. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, went a step further based on updated data from the company's clinical trial and fully approved it for use in people age 16 and older. Public health officials hope the action will convince unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. ""This FDA approval should give added confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective,"" President Joe Biden, who has sought to increase vaccination levels, wrote on Twitter. Shortly after the FDA's announcement, the Pentagon said it is preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for U.S. military personnel. U.S. health officials expect that the FDA's full approval also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. ""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated,"" said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner. More than 204 million people in the United States have received the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA's approval extends the shelf life of Pfizer shots from six months to nine months. It also confirms that the vaccine increases risk of heart inflammation, particularly among young men in the week following their second shot. The approval also makes it easier for physicians to prescribe a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine off-label for people who may benefit from additional protection against COVID-19. The FDA gave emergency-use authorization to the vaccine for people age 16 and older in December - making it the first shot to gain such backing in the United States - and then gave further emergency-use authorization for people age 12 and up in May. The FDA is awaiting additional data before deciding on fully approving Pfizer's vaccine in children ages 12 to 15. Woodcock said the FDA was not recommending children below 12 years of age get the vaccine at this time, with more data needed to ensure it is safe for them, telling reporters it ""would be a great concern if people vaccinate children because we don't have the proper data."" Pfizer is expected to submit data this fall to support the shot's emergency-use authorization for children under 12 based on smaller doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics, representing children's doctors, discouraged having children under 12 receive the vaccine. Pfizer's shot has received conditional regulatory approval elsewhere including Britain and the European Union. The two other COVID-19 vaccines given emergency-use authorization - made by Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson - have not yet received full FDA approval. U.S. HIT HARD The United States leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. More than 625,000 Americans have died from the disease, including an average of more than 600 daily in recent weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71% of Americans age 12 and older - the population eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines - have gotten at least one dose and 60.2% are fully vaccinated. For the entire population, including children up to age 11 for whom no vaccines are yet approved, 60.7% of Americans have received at least one dose and 51.5% are fully vaccinated. In Pfizer's clinical trial, approximately 12,000 recipients of the vaccine have been followed for at least six months. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement the FDA's approval ""affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed."" The vaccine will now be marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA on Aug. 13 authorized a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer's shot has not yet been authorized for more widespread use as a booster. A third dose of Pfizer's vaccine has significantly improved protection from infection and serious illness among people age 60 and older in Israel compared with those who received two shots, data release by the Israeli health ministry on Sunday showed."
"U.S. Open to offer record overall purse, winners' payout down",1338,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Open will offer total prize money of $57.5 million this year, eclipsing the record payout of $57.2 million set in 2019, tournament organisers said on Monday. The event was held without spectators last year, with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) lowering the prize money to $53.4 million due to lost revenue. Despite the overall increase this year, prize money for the two singles winners has come down from $3 million to $2.5 million, with the runner-up cheque also reduced to $1.25 million, a decrease of $50,000 from 2020. ""Last year was a very difficult year for all of us, and the pandemic had a profound impact on the USTA's financial health,"" said USTA CEO and executive director Mike Dowse. ""Yet we worked -- and continue to work -- extremely hard to ensure that tennis would continue to thrive for the long-term at every level, and that work led to more than four million new and returning players participating in tennis in 2020."" First-round payouts go to $75,000, a jump of 23% from 2020, while second-round prize money rises to $115,000 from $100,000. The USTA added that prize money has also been bumped up in the doubles, mixed doubles and wheelchair events. The U.S. Open, which will welcome back fans this year, starts on Aug. 30.

Pfizer to buy cancer drug developer Trillium in $2.3 bln deal,1295,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday it would buy Canadian drug developer Trillium Therapeutics Inc (TRIL.TO) in a $2.26 billion deal to strengthen its arsenal of blood cancer therapies. Pfizer, which acquired a $25 million stake in Trillium last year, will buy the remaining outstanding shares for $18.50 apiece, representing a 203.8% premium on the stock's last closing price. Pfizer expects to benefit from Canada-based Trillium's blood-cancer therapies that target a ""don't eat me"" signal used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. Forty Seven Inc, which is also developing drugs that target the same antibodies, was bought by Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) for $4.9 billion last year. More than 1 million people worldwide were diagnosed with blood cancer in 2020, representing almost 6% of all cancer diagnoses. The same year, more than 700,000 people worldwide died from a form of blood cancer. Trillium's U.S.-listed shares were trading at $17.73 before the bell on Monday, having fallen 59% in 2021 as of their last close.

U.S. blacklists Eritrean official over human rights abuse in Ethiopia's Tigray,3212,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an Eritrean official it accused of being engaged in serious human rights abuse in the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, as Washington warned it would continue to target those involved in prolonging the conflict. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted Filipos Woldeyohannes, the chief of staff of the Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF). The Treasury said he commands EDF forces that have been operating in Tigray. The Treasury accused the forces of being responsible for massacres, sexual assaults and purposely shooting civilians in the streets, among other human rights abuses. ""The United States will continue to identify and pursue action against those involved in serious human rights abuse in Ethiopia and prolonging the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement. The Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said it rejected Washington's action on Monday, adding that the accusations are ""utterly baseless."" ""Eritrea calls on the U.S. Administration to bring the case to an independent adjudication if it indeed has facts to prove its false allegations,"" the statement said. The United States has repeatedly called for Eritrean troops to withdraw from Tigray. Eritrea sent troops to Tigray after Ethiopian federal forces launched an offensive in November in response to attacks on federal government bases by forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Eritrea denied for months that its troops were in the region, but later acknowledged their presence while denying they were responsible for abuses. The U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said in June the country now has ""effective control"" of parts of Tigray, calling for troops to withdraw and for a prompt investigation into abuses, including the abduction of refugees. ""Today’s action demonstrates the United States’ commitment to imposing costs on those responsible for these despicable acts, which worsen a conflict that has led to tremendous suffering by Ethiopians,"" Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in the statement. ""We urge Eritrea to immediately and permanently withdraw its forces from Ethiopia, and urge the parties to the conflict to begin ceasefire negotiations and end human rights abuses,"" Gacki added. President Joe Biden's administration is far advanced in its assessment of whether to call events crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes, Robert Godec, acting assistant secretary of state for the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, said in June. Doctors said hundreds of women reported they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, Reuters reported in April. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said last month that more than 100,000 children in Tigray could suffer life-threatening malnutrition in the next 12 months, as hundreds of thousands in the region face famine conditions.

Egypt to intensify vaccination ahead of a fourth COVID-19 wave,2326,"CAIRO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Egypt will vaccinate all 4.5 million of its state employees against COVID-19 in August and September as it seeks to accelerate vaccinations ahead of a likely fourth wave of infections, the health minister said on Monday. The country's infection rate is still low but started to increase last week and the upward curve is expected to continue for a while, Hala Zayed told a briefing, adding that a significant increase is expected in late September. ""It is important for the Egyptian government and the political leadership that we work to intensify vaccinations in the coming period,"" Zayed said. As part of the programme, all workers in pre-university education, university employees and university students - a total of more than 5 million people - will be vaccinated before the start of the academic year in October, she said. So far, about 10 million people have registered online to get vaccinated and nearly 7.5 million have received at least one dose, Zayed said. The prime minister said in June the government aimed to vaccinate 40% of the population of more than 100 million by the end of this year. Egypt has received millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik, and Johnson & Johnson. It has also produced 15 million doses of Sinovac's vaccine locally, Zayed said, and will receive about 5.2 million doses produced by Pfizer and Moderna in September. The Egyptian Drug Authority on Monday approved an emergency use licence for the locally produced VACSERA-Sinovac vaccines, it said in a statement. The country plans to have 800 vaccine centres running by the end of August, up from 657 currently. Egypt has recorded 286,352 COVID-19 infections as of Sunday, including 16,674 deaths. However, officials and experts say the real number of infections is far higher but is not reflected in government figures because of low coronavirus testing rates and the exclusion of private test results. The first COVID-19 infection from the Delta variant was discovered in Egypt in mid-July, Zayed said, adding that it concerned a 35-year-old woman who did not need hospitalization. Other cases were discovered later among Egyptians but none were hospitalized because they had mild symptoms, she added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Italy reports 44 coronavirus deaths on Monday, 4,168 new cases",916,"ROME, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Italy reported 44 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday, compared with 23 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 4,168 from 5,923. Italy has registered 128,795 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eighth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.49 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 3,928 on Monday up from 3,767 a day earlier. There were 45 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 33 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 485 from a previous 472.

Sensor maker Velodyne's founder calls for chairman's resignation,1414,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Velodyne Lidar Inc's (VLDR.O) founder David Hall on Monday called on Chairman Michael Dee to resign from the sensor maker's board, blaming him for a steep fall in the company's stock price. ""Dee has spearheaded major business decisions that leave him responsible for the company's nearly 80% stock price decline, in my view,"" Hall, who was removed as chairman earlier this year, said in an letter to the board. Velodyne did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Velodyne shares were up about 14% on Monday after having tumbled about 80% since the company went public in September through a merger with a blank-check company. Hall had sent another letter to the board in June, calling for the resignation of Anand Gopalan as chief executive officer and Joseph Culkin as chairman, among others. Gopalan left the company in July, while Culkin handed over the chairman's role to Dee earlier this month, citing health reasons. The ongoing saga at the sensor maker was triggered after Hall was removed as chairman and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, as marketing chief in February on the grounds of lack of honesty, a charge Marta said the couple was not allowed to rebut. Hall, in his latest letter, also asked for the removal of director Hamid Zarringhalam. Dee and Zarringhalam did not reply to requests for comment via LinkedIn.

Firefight involving Western forces erupts amid Kabul airport evacuation chaos,5246,"KABUL, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A firefight involving Western forces erupted at Kabul airport on Monday when Afghan guards exchanged fire with unidentified gunmen, Germany's military said, adding to the evacuation chaos as Washington faces pressure to extend its deadline to withdraw. Thousands of Afghans and foreigners have thronged the airport for days, hoping to catch a flight out after Taliban fighters captured Kabul on Aug. 15 and as U.S.-led forces aim to complete their pullout by the end of the month. Twenty people have been killed in the chaos at the airport, most in shootings and stampedes in the heat and dust, penned in by concrete blast walls, as U.S. and international forces try to evacuate their citizens and vulnerable Afghans. One person was killed in Monday's clash, the German military said. CNN said a sniper outside the airport fired at Afghan guards - some 600 former government soldiers are helping U.S. forces at the airport - near its north gate. U.S. and German forces were involved in the clash, Germany's military said. Three wounded Afghan guards were being treated at a field hospital in the airport, it said. Two NATO officials at the airport said the situation was under control after the firing. The Taliban have deployed fighters outside the airport, where they have tried to help enforce some kind of order. On Sunday, Taliban fighters beat back crowds at the airport a day after seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates as the deadline for the withdrawal of foreign troops approaches. The Taliban seized power just over a week ago as the United States and its allies withdraw troops after a 20-year war launched in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as U.S. forces hunted al Qaeda leaders and sought to punish their Taliban hosts. The administration of Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, struck a deal with the Taliban last year allowing the United Sates to withdraw its forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. 'HOURS, NOT WEEKS' President Joe Biden said on Sunday the security situation in Afghanistan was changing rapidly and remained dangerous. ""Let me be clear, the evacuation of thousands from Kabul is going to be hard and painful"" and would have been ""no matter when it began"", Biden said in a briefing at the White House. ""We have a long way to go and a lot could still go wrong."" A soldier assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division provides security at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Afghanistan, August 21, 2021. Picture taken August 21, 2021. U.S. Marine Corps/Cpl. Davis Harris/Handout via REUTERS Biden said U.S. troops might stay beyond their Aug. 31 deadline to oversee the evacuation. But a Taliban leadership official said foreign forces had not sought an extension and it would not be granted if they had. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge Biden this week to extend the deadline. Defence Minister Ben Wallace said Britain was ""down to hours now, not weeks"" in its evacuation plan and forces on the ground needed to use every moment they had to get people out. Johnson's spokesperson said Britain still wanted to fly out thousands of people and had not set a hard deadline for when evacuations end. ""We will continue to run our evacuation process as long as the security situation allows... We need to be flexible in our approach,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it would not be possible for British evacuations to continue once U.S. troops leave. read more Panicked Afghans have clamoured to board flights out of Kabul, fearing reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Sunni Muslim group enforced when it held power from 1996 to 2001. The chaos at the airport is also disrupting shipments of aid going in to Afghanistan. The World Health Organization said 500 tonnes of medical supplies due to be delivered this week were stuck because Kabul airport was closed to commercial flights, Richard Brennan, WHO regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, told Reuters. He said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its storage hub in Dubai to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees in Afghanistan. OPPOSITION Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government, while their forces focus on the last pockets of opposition. Taliban fighters had re-taken three districts in the northern province of Baghlan which opposition forces briefly captured and had surrounded opposition forces in the Panjshir valley, an old stronghold of Taliban opponents northeast of Kabul. ""The enemy is under siege in Panjshir,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Massoud said on Sunday he hoped to hold talks with the Taliban but his forces in Panjshir - remnants of army units, special forces and militiamen - were ready to fight. Zabihullah also said the Taliban wanted to ""solve the problem through talks"". In general, peace has prevailed in recent days. Reuters spoke to eight doctors in hospitals in several cities who said they had not heard of any violence or received any casualties from clashes since Thursday.

"In Canada's pandemic election, unvaccinated candidates are knocking on doors",4661,"MIRAMICHI, New Brunswick, Aug 23 (Reuters) - In Canadian federal elections, it is a tradition for candidates to knock on people's doors to ask for their support. Ahead of next month's vote, most of the contenders doing the rounds will be vaccinated against COVID-19 - but not all of them. The Conservatives, led by the still little-known Erin O'Toole, and the small right-wing People's Party of Canada (PPC) are not requiring inoculations for their candidates as a fourth wave builds mainly among the unvaccinated. This does not sit well with millions of inoculated Canadians, who are enjoying their first taste of freedom and normality after 17 months of pandemic life. Three-quarters of them say they have little sympathy for those who choose not to get the shots, according to an Aug. 17 Angus Reid poll. ""If you have a candidate going door-to-door and they are not vaccinated, and they knock on the door of a senior citizen who is immunocompromised... then they put them in danger,"" said Trevor Boutilier, a 40-year old Ottawa bus driver, who is not planning on voting Conservative for the first time in his life. Two days before calling a snap Sept. 20 vote, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mandated vaccinations for federal employees and domestic air and train travelers, thrusting the issue to the forefront of his election bid. While campaigning in the Atlantic provinces on Sunday, Trudeau brought along Procurement Minister Anita Anand, whom he called his ""minister of vaccines,"" and Liberal candidates wore pins saying ""I'm fully vaccinated."" ""We now need to protect our kids,"" Trudeau said at a Liberal rally in Miramichi, New Brunswick, referring to children under 12 who cannot yet access any of the inoculations. ""We have not finished the fight against COVID-19."" Trudeau, 49, called the election on Aug. 15, two years ahead of schedule, in hopes that his handling of the pandemic, his successful national inoculation campaign and his plans to support an economic rebound would propel Liberals to a majority after relying on the support of opposition parties since 2019. ""The Liberals will want to make (vaccine mandates) a wedge issue because they know that it's divisive within the Conservative tribe,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos. In Canada, 72% of the eligible population has already been vaccinated against COVID-19, and support for a proof-of-vaccination system for travel and public events is above 61% nationally, according to an EKOS poll published on Aug. 16. Even most Conservatives and O'Toole himself have had two shots. But about 15% of Conservative voters still have not been inoculated, compared with 4% of Liberals, the EKOS poll said. A third of PPC voters have not been vaccinated. PPC leader Maxime Bernier on Friday called Trudeau's vaccine mandate for domestic travel ""fascist,"" making it clear where right-leaning voters can go if O'Toole were to agree with Trudeau. ""This mirrors what's going on in the United States, with Republicans being much less likely to vaccinate than Democrats,"" EKOS President Frank Graves said. Unlike in the United States, Canadian politicians of different stripes have, by and large, approached the fight against COVID-19 as a non-partisan national health issue. POLLS TIGHTENING O'Toole, 48, has argued that his position on federal workers is essentially the same as the Liberals' because the mandate is not likely to be fully enforced, with the main union representing public servants saying accommodations like testing must be made. But the Conservative leader has struggled more to defend his position on candidates and travel. A campaign official declined to say how many Conservative candidates had not been vaccinated. ""Erin O'Toole won't come clean on which candidates he is putting forward... who won't get vaccinated,"" Trudeau said on Thursday. O'Toole last week urged his unvaccinated candidates to get the shots and said those who do not would be required to take daily tests during the campaign. Polls have tightened since the race began, in part because many voters did not like the idea of having an election during a pandemic, pollsters say. During the initial days of the campaign, O'Toole shunned in-person rallies for virtual events, calling ""Mr. Trudeau's pandemic election"" a threat to public health. Trudeau says the pandemic is the reason an election is needed, so Canadians can choose the party that will lead them safely through it. The Liberals would win 32.4% of the vote, compared with 32.8% for the Conservatives, putting the parties in a statistical tie, according to an EKOS poll from Sunday.

Brazil's Bolsonaro wants date for ending mask use,1567,"BRASÍLIA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday that he will ask his health minister to set a date to end the use of face masks as a means of reducing transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil. Maks have become a political issue in Brazil, with Bolsonaro long ranting against their use and frequently refusing to wear one in public despite a legal requirement to do so. In the radio interview, the president argued that with much of the population already vaccinated or having caught the virus, masks are not needed. But epidemiologists say it is too early for such a move, especially due to the rise of the Delta variant in Brazil. Although nearly 60% of Brazil's population have received their first dose, only 25% are fully vaccinated. Bolsonaro said he had also commissioned a study into the use of mask wearing with a view to recommending an end to their widespread use. At over 570,000, Brazil has the world's second highest coronavirus death toll behind only the United States, propelled - according to epidemiologists - by a lack of coordinated national social distancing measures. Bolsonaro said he hoped a date for ending the widespread use of masks could be set later on Monday. Any such move could prove to be largely moot, however, with states and municipalities free to set their own COVID-19 restrictions in Brazil. Any federal government position on the matter would likely only function as a guideline, though it would be considered a victory by Bolsonaro's far-right base.

Israel finds COVID-19 vaccine booster significantly lowers infection risk,2478,"JERUSALEM, Aug 22 (Reuters) - A third dose of Pfizer (PFE.N)'s COVID-19 vaccine has significantly improved protection from infection and serious illness among people aged 60 and older in Israel compared with those who received two shots, findings published by the Health Ministry showed on Sunday. The data were presented at a meeting of a ministry panel of vaccination experts on Thursday and uploaded to its website on Sunday, though the full details of the study were not released. The findings were on par with separate statistics reported last week by Israel's Maccabi healthcare provider, one of several organisations administering booster shots to try to curb the Delta coronavirus variant. Latest COVID-19 news Breaking down statistics from Israel's Gertner Institute and KI Institute, ministry officials said that among people aged 60 and over, the protection against infection provided from 10 days after a third dose was four times higher than after two doses. A medical worker prepares to administer a patient's third dose of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine as country launches booster shots for over 40-year-olds, in Jerusalem August 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ammar Awad A third jab for over 60-year-olds offered five to six times greater protection after 10 days with regard to serious illness and hospitalisation. That age group is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and in Israel was the first to be inoculated when the vaccine drive began in late December. In recent weeks, the health ministry has said immunity has diminished over time for seniors and younger people as well. Most vaccinated people who fell severely ill in Israel were over 60 and with underlying health conditions. Israel started administering third jabs to over 60-year-olds on July 30. On Thursday it dropped the age of eligibility for a booster to 40, and included pregnant women, teachers and health care workers below that age. Third doses are given only to those who received their second shot at least five months ago. The United States has announced plans to offer booster shots to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have announced booster campaigns. Fighting an outbreak of the Delta variant since June, Israel presently has one of the world's highest infection rates per capita. Close to 1.5 million people out of the country's 9.3 million population have taken a third jab. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Lawyer for 'Hotel Rwanda' hero deported for visa violation,2657,"KIGALI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A Belgian lawyer for the man whose story inspired the film ""Hotel Rwanda"", who is being tried on terrorism charges, has been deported for working without a permit, the head of Rwanda's immigration service said on Monday. Paul Rusesabagina, the ex-hotelier portrayed as a hero in the 2004 film about Rwanda's 1994 genocide, is accused of nine terrorism-related charges, including forming and funding an armed rebel group. Vincent Lurquin was deported on Saturday after appearing in court as one of Rusesabagina's lawyers the previous day despite lacking legal permission to do so, officials said. ""He did some work, but he was not authorized to work,"" Regis Gatarayiha, director general at the Rwanda Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration, told Reuters. Lurquin was in the country on a visitor's visa, Gatarayiha said. ""He is a lawyer of Rusesabagina in a case in Belgium ... [but] to be able to assist him in courts of Rwanda - he is not a lawyer who is accredited by the Rwanda Bar Association,"" said Gatarayiha. Lurquin should have first gotten accreditation from the Rwanda Bar Association and then obtained a permit from Rwanda immigration, which he did not do, Gatarayiha said. ""Any claims that he illegally or clandestinely entered under a tourist visa are unequivocally false,"" Rusesabagina's legal team said in a statement. Lurquin had been representing Rusesabagina in a Belgium-based investigation and needed to speak to his client, according to the statement. ""With the assistance and knowledge of the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he arrived in Kigali, and told the Rwanda immigration authorities that he was a lawyer, coming into Rwanda to visit a detained client. He was given a visa by the Rwandan immigration officials,"" the statement said. The official record of Friday's trial did not include Lurquin appearing on behalf of Rusesabagina, who was represented only by a Rwandan lawyer, the statement said. All Rusesabagina's non-Rwandan lawyers have in the past said that they were denied permits to defend him in Rwandan courts. The Rwanda Bar Association said Lurquin was not a member of the organization and was not allowed to practice in the country. Government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo responded to the Association's statement on Twitter, saying Lurquin's behaviour was ""crooked"" and a ""desperate"" attempt to distract from the facts of the trial. Prosecutors have requested a life sentence for Rusesabagina, whose family says he is in poor health and being mistreated in prison. The court is scheduled to issue its verdict on Sept. 20.

Euro zone business boom roared on in August -PMI,3941,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Business activity in the euro zone grew strongly this month, only dipping from July's two-decade high monthly pace, as a rapid COVID-19 vaccination drive allowed more firms to reopen and customers to venture out, a survey showed.

""We continue to see the potential spread of more virulent virus variants and the prolongation of supply chain issues as the main risks to the economic recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.

The composite employment index held at 56.1. A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry nudged down to 59.7 from July's 15-year high of 59.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 59.8. Demand slowed marginally from July - suggesting the rebound will continue - but the services business expectations index, which measure optimism about the year ahead, dropped to 68.6 from 69.1. ""We continue to see the potential spread of more virulent virus variants and the prolongation of supply chain issues as the main risks to the economic recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics. ""Therefore, the level of uncertainty around the forecast remains very high, but we still expect a strong recovery over the coming quarters."" Manufacturers had another solid month, their PMI remaining well above the breakeven mark at 61.5, albeit below July's 62.8 and the 62.0 poll estimate. An index measuring output that feeds into to the composite PMI fell to 59.2 from 61.1. But supply delays - the delivery times index was near a survey low - again played a key role in driving up the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index was 87.3, although down from July's record high of 89.2. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Kabul airport curbs blocking medical supplies for Afghans -WHO,2060,"GENEVA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - More than 500 tonnes of medical supplies including surgical equipment and severe malnutrition kits due to be delivered to Afghanistan this week are stuck because of Kabul airport restrictions, the World Health Organization said on Monday. Aid agencies say it is critical that medical and food supplies reach some 300,000 people displaced in Afghanistan over the past two months amid advances by Islamist Taliban insurgents that culminated in their capture of Kabul on Aug. 15. Nearly 18.5 million people - half the population - rely on aid and the humanitarian needs are expected to grow due to drought. read more But the closure of Kabul airport to commercial flights has held up deliveries, WHO regional emergency director Dr. Richard Brennan told Reuters. ""While the eyes of the world now are on the people being evacuated and the planes leaving, we need to get supplies in to help those who are left behind,"" Brennan said in an emailed statement. He said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its warehouse in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees from Afghanistan. The United States has enlisted six commercial airlines to help move Afghan evacuees, however Washington and NATO coalition partners have so far indicated that they cannot bring supplies on incoming evacuation planes due to ""operational constraints and security concerns"", Brennan said. read more ""The U.S. is using these commercial airlines only for evacuation,"" he said, adding that the WHO was exploring various options and reaching out to other governments. ""We have been advised to explore options at other airports such as Kandahar, Jalalabad and Bagram air bases. We do not yet have aircraft to fly even to those bases."" The executive director of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said on Monday around 10 million children across Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance and that conditions are expected to deteriorate further.

Vietnam deploys troops to enforce COVID lockdown in largest city,2467,"HANOI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam deployed soldiers on Monday to help enforce a strict COVID lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, its biggest urban area and current epicentre of its worst coronavirus outbreak to date. Vietnam implemented movement restrictions in Ho Chi Minh City in early July, but announced its harshest curbs last week as infections have continued to surge. Authorities have said enforcement of recent curbs has not been sufficiently strict. After containing COVID-19 for much of last year, Vietnam has recorded 358,456 infections and at least 8,666 fatalities. Ho Chi Minh City has recorded over 180,000 infections - half the country's total - and 7,010 deaths, making up about 80% of the nation's fatalities, according to the health ministry. Most of those cases have been recorded in Ho Chi Minh City and its surrounding industrial provinces, where the Delta variant of the virus has sent numbers soaring since late April. The government said on Friday a tighter lockdown would begin on Monday, prohibiting people from leaving their homes, even for food, and said the military would step in to help. The announcement, later amended so that people in some areas could still shop for food, was subsequently reverted to a total ban, triggering confusion and panic-buying at supermarkets in the city over the weekend. read more Witnesses said soldiers were delivering food to residents of the city on Monday and images broadcast by state media showed armed soldiers manning checkpoints and checking documents. Vietnam has over recent weeks sent 14,600 additional doctors and nurses to the city and its neighbouring provinces to support its overwhelmed medical system, the ministry said. Patients with mild or no symptoms have been told to self isolate at home. The government said on Friday it would send 130,000 tonnes of rice from state stockpiles to Ho Chi Minh City and 23 other cities and provinces. People in the city's Phu Nhuan and Go Vap districts told Reuters they had received packages of rice, meat, fish and vegetables from the military. Vietnam received two shipments of 501,600 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses from Poland and 200,000 Sinopharm doses donation from China on Monday, the government said. In total, the country has secured over 23 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines but just 1.8% of its 98 million people have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the region.

Studies show modest job gains from U.S. states' benefit cuts,5549,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - New U.S. state-level data and accompanying studies show a group of largely Republican governors did not yet get the job boom they hoped for by cutting federal unemployment benefits this summer, but the loss of the stipend did appear to prompt some of the unemployed to take jobs. Underlying that topline conclusion, however, is also evidence of a more nuanced reshuffling among different employment categories that could have bearing on the economy's performance in the critical months to come. Separate analyses released last week, using different data sets and methods, concluded that the 26 states that cut a $300 weekly federal unemployment stipend this summer did see the unemployed find a job at a faster rate, perhaps as much as 6 percentage points, than did the 24 states planning to continue the benefit at least until its scheduled national expiration in early September. However, the states that cut benefits saw worse results in pulling people back into the formal labor force, to the degree that overall job growth in the two groups of states was nearly identical from May through July. In the U.S. government's regular employment surveys, people are considered unemployed only if they are looking for a job; others are considered out of the labor force until they start a job or begin a job search. While the end of federal supplemental unemployment benefits may have motivated people to take jobs in the one group of states, ""in non-cutoff states employment rose almost as much by bringing people back into the labor force,"" meaning people who had not been looking for work at all in the previous month had started a search and found a job, wrote Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed. Goldman Sachs economists reached a similar conclusion. Though neither offered a comprehensive explanation for why that difference may have emerged between the two groups of states, the finding could spell trouble for continued job gains this fall if coronavirus cases continue to surge. Federal Reserve officials and others expect robust employment gains in the coming months as schools reopen, daily life edges back to normal - and the extra federal unemployment benefits expire nationally. Arguments about the continued need for the benefits, pressed most pointedly by Republican state leaders, emerged in the spring as national coronavirus case rates collapsed amid the first rounds of COVID-19 vaccinations, job openings soared, and employers complained they had trouble getting people to come back to work. The Goldman Sachs study noted that the cut in benefits appeared to have its biggest impact on lower-paid workers in the leisure and hospitality industry - an intuitive finding since the weekly federal benefit represents a higher proportion of the pay they would receive from returning to work. Yet those jobs are also the most susceptible if the surge in the virus changes people's willingness to participate in ""close contact"" services. At the same time, Goldman noted that its findings ""suggest"" those who left the labor force since the start of the pandemic ""did so for non-financial reasons such as concern about Covid."" Just as they did not flock back to the job market this summer in the states that cut benefits, they may not do so in the other states this fall if the disease is spreading. ""Our finding that benefit expiration did not encourage labor force participation was a somewhat negative surprise, and increases the risk that some workers may be slow to return to the labor force, particularly if the Delta variant increases concerns around health risk,"" wrote Goldman economists Joseph Briggs and Ronnie Walker. Some of the major states that cut benefits, including Florida and Texas, also saw the start last month of an overwhelming wave of new coronavirus cases. Goldman's base case remains for strong employment growth through the end of the year, with 3.4 million jobs added through December, and a 4.1% year-end unemployment rate that's below some economists' estimation of full employment. IMPACT ON CONSUMPTION Both the numbers of unemployed and those out of the labor force increased markedly during the pandemic, and policymakers hope improved hiring among each group will trim or even fully reclaim the 5.7 million jobs still missing from before the pandemic. U.S. firms added jobs at a rapid pace this summer, nearly a million a month in June and July. But the record level of job openings suggested the job gains could have been even greater, perhaps by as much as 400,000, Goldman estimated. On that basis, the national expiration of unemployment benefits, slated for early September, would prompt an additional 1.5 million people to take jobs by the end of the year, Goldman estimated. A similar study by a group including University of Massachusetts Amherst professor Arindrajit Dube also concluded the unemployed were more likely to find jobs in states that cut benefits, and saw ""a modest, but precisely measured increase in the probability of job finding in the Withdrawal states,"" of about 4.4 percentage points. Yet they concluded it was ultimately a bad deal for the states involved. The group had a slight increase in earnings, but lost far more in federal benefits, with a net drop of consumption in those states of about $2 billion. Goldman economists concurred that the loss of unemployment benefits will likely contribute to an upcoming drag on the economy as an array of pandemic-era programs expire.

Analysis: Risks of party revolt grow for Japan's PM Suga after local poll loss,4040,"TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Unpopular Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga looks increasingly vulnerable to a challenge from within his party for the nation's top job after an ally's defeat in a local election on Sunday seen as a referendum on Suga's COVID-19 response. If Suga loses, he would join a long list of short-term premiers. He took over in September after Shinzo Abe quit, citing ill health and ending a rare lengthy term of nearly eight years. Suga, whose term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader ends next month, has seen his support slide from highs of about 70% to below 30%, with a weekend poll by ANN News putting support at 25.8% as Japan battles an explosive surge of COVID-19 infections. On Monday, domestic media reported that former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is likely to run in the LDP's leadership race. read more The defeat of Hachiro Okonogi, son of Suga's political mentor and a former cabinet minister, in Sunday's election for Yokohama city mayor, will most likely amplify calls to replace Suga ahead of a lower house election that must be held by November. Opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan candidate Takeharu Yamanaka, a former professor of public health, won by a landslide in Suga's constituency near Tokyo. L1N2PT063 ""The LDP is being severely criticised in my constituency, so it's very hard to fight under Suga,"" said a junior LDP lawmaker from a conservative rural district, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. Such views are expected to spread. ""For certain, voices saying they can't fight the general election under Suga will grow louder,"" said political analyst Atsuo Ito. ""The chances of multiple candidates (in the LDP race) will increase."" Still, uncertainty remains. Suga told reporters on Monday there was no change in his plan to run in the LDP poll. No party bosses who backed Suga last year have publicly withdrawn support. ""We should not change the ship's captain in the midst of a storm,"" one senior LDP lawmaker said ahead of the mayoral vote. ELECTION TRACK RECORD Scenarios include Suga losing the LDP race to a rival, bowing out early, or winning the party vote and keeping his job if LDP losses in the lower house poll are limited. Suga's election track record isn't good. Abe led his coalition to victory in six national elections, but Suga ha seen defeats in by-elections and a lacklustre showing in a Tokyo local poll. Lower house members' four-year terms end on Oct. 21. An election for the chamber must be held by Nov. 28 but is expected sooner. Suga's had hoped to contain the virus outbreak and call a general election after a successful Olympics. That scenario was upended after a COVID-19 surge led to a fourth state of emergency in Tokyo. Alongside Kishida, former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, an Abe disciple, has said she wants to run, as has Seiko Noda, another female ex-cabinet minister. Both are seen as long-shots, as is former education minister Hakubun Shimomura. Administrative Reform Minister Taro Kono, running Japan's lagging vaccination rollout, and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba top of the list of lawmakers voters favour as next premier, followed by Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. Kishida, once seen as Abe's heir, ranks rock bottom. Abe himself has single-digit support. Prime ministers have sometimes survived poor ratings but Suga is at particular risk because his term as party president is ending just as a general election looms. Decisions by party bosses, including Abe, his ally Finance Minister Taro Aso, and their rival, LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, matter greatly. But younger lawmakers may be more worried about losing their seats than toeing the party line. Those MPs ""are very uneasy about their own elections. It's unclear whether they would vote for Suga even if their faction bosses told them to do so,"" analyst Ito said.

"Analysis: China, Pakistan, India jockey for position in Afghanistan's new Great Game",6037,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Russian and British empires battled over Afghanistan in the 19th century, and the United States and the Soviet Union in the 20th. As the Taliban takes over in the strategic, landlocked nation, the new Great Game has Pakistan in control, with its ally China looking to cement its grip on the region. Pakistan has deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the Islamist group as it battled the U.S.-backed government in Kabul - charges denied by Islamabad. When the Taliban captured Kabul last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Afghans had broken the ""shackles of slavery"". As the Taliban holds discussions to decide on its government model, media reports have said some Pakistani officials are involved. A Foreign Office spokesperson in Islamabad said Pakistan wanted an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan that ensured peace and stability in the region but added the ""key role remains with the Afghans"". China, with no previous involvement in Afghanistan but a strong alliance with Pakistan, has held out an olive branch to the Taliban, enticed by the country's mineral wealth, including its large reserves of lithium, a key component for electric vehicles. China is also looking at the prospect of extra security for its narrow land route through the Karakoram mountains into Pakistan. And then there is India - Pakistan's old enemy, which has been locked in a military standoff with China along their disputed border for more than a year. India was a key supporter of the ousted regime in Kabul and as both Pakistan and China become key players in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, New Delhi's nervousness in increasing. China however says its main aim in reaching out to the Taliban is to protect its western Xinjiang region from anti-Beijing East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) militants, who could seek sanctuary within Afghanistan. ""While Pakistan might be thinking of leveraging on Afghanistan against India, this is not necessarily the case for China,"" said Zhang Li, a professor of South Asian studies at Sichuan University. ""China's primary concern now is for the Taliban to ... build an inclusive and moderate regime so that terrorism would not spill over to Xinjiang and the region. Any other calculus further to that remains to be seen."" The U.S. government says ETIM no longer exists as a formal organization and is instead a broad label China uses to oppress a variety of Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs, in its Xinjiang region. China denies all accusations of abuse. China has dangled the prospect of providing the two things the Taliban needs to govern Afghanistan: diplomatic recognition and much-needed infrastructure and economic assistance, said Brahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. ""An opportunistic China is certain to exploit the new opening to make strategic inroads into mineral-rich Afghanistan and deepen its penetration of Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia,"" he said. BITTER MEMORIES There was much cheering in Pakistan over India's discomfiture at the turn of events, said Raza Ahmad Rumi, a political commentator, who teaches at Ithaca College in New York. The two countries have fought three wars since they became independent nations when the subcontinent was divided in 1947. ""The jubilation in Pakistan witnessed on social media and TV screens was largely linked to the undoing of Indian influence as conventional policy circles viewed (Afghan President Ashraf) Ghani's close links with India as a threat,"" Rumi said. India has bitter memories of the previous Taliban stint in power from 1996 to 2001 and the group's links to Pakistan. An Indian Airlines plane was hijacked in 1999 and ultimately landed in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. New Delhi freed three senior Pakistani militants in its jails in exchange for the return of the passengers and the Taliban allowed the hijackers and the released prisoners to go to Pakistan. ""Our position today is one of adjusting to reality. We have to play the long game in Afghanistan. We don't have a contiguous border but we have stakes there,"" said Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Kabul. Over the past year as the Taliban emerged as a dominant force and U.S.-brokered negotiations began in Doha, Indian diplomats had opened a line with the group, diplomatic sources in New Delhi said. ""We are talking to all stakeholders,"" one of them said, but did not want to get to the specifics of the discussions. There has been criticism at home that India put all its eggs in the basket of the Ghani government when the United States itself had begun talks with the Taliban, and that New Delhi left it too late. 'NOT A RE-RUN' Still, India as a major economic player can be attractive to the Taliban, looking to avoid an over-dependence on China, the source said. India has development projects in every one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, small and big, including the parliament building in Kabul that it built, which was over-run by gun-toting Taliban men after sweeping into the city last week. Myra MacDonald, author of three books on South Asia and a former Reuters journalist, said while the Taliban takeover was a setback for India, it was not game over for New Delhi. ""This is not a re-run of the past. Everyone is going to be much more careful this time about letting Islamist terrorism in Afghanistan explode as in the pre-9/11 days."" ""Plus in relative terms, India is much more economically stronger than Pakistan this time around."" A senior member of the Taliban has told Reuters that impoverished Afghanistan needs help from countries in the region, including Iran, as well as the United States and Russia. ""We expect them to help us, to support our people, especially the health sector and especially the business sector and mining sector,"" said Waheedullah Hashimi, who has access to the group's decision-making. ""Our job is to convince them to accept us."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"With DOJ's focus on wage fixing and no poach agreements, non-compete and antitrust laws collide",7917,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 23, 2021 - Many business executives have at least a passing familiarity with restrictive covenants, which generally come in two flavors: non-competes (which preclude an employee from working for a competitor for a set period of time) and non-solicits (which preclude an employee from soliciting clients or other employees once they depart). These agreements are made directly between an employer and an employee, and it is likely that many of these same executives have been subject to one at some point in their career. In the last few years restrictive covenants have received scrutiny from some states, and even the federal government, but that scrutiny generally has been focused on the enforceability of restrictive covenants with lower-level employees (often measured by salary thresholds). Far more serious scrutiny has been paid to agreements between companies not to hire (or ""poach"") each other's employees or to fix the compensation of those employees. While restrictive covenants are generally enforceable in most states to the extent that they are narrowly tailored to protect a legitimate interest — like protecting the employer's goodwill or confidential information for a reasonable period of time — wage fixing and so-called ""naked"" no-poach agreements (agreements without legitimate, legal justifications) are generally viewed as purely anticompetitive behavior. In addition to not being enforceable, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission brought civil enforcement actions against companies like Lucasfilm, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Google, eBay, Intel and Intuit arising out of these types of agreements. Those civil enforcement actions typically resulted in promises by the companies to end such agreements and institute compliance or monitoring programs, but no penalties. In 2016, during the final months of the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued joint ""Antitrust Guidance for Human Resources Professionals"" asserting the illegality of, and potential penalties for, entering into agreements to (1) fix the salary or other terms of compensation, whether at a specific level or within a range, for employees (wage fixing agreements); or (2) preclude companies from hiring or soliciting each other's employees without justification (no poaching agreements). The Antitrust Guidance emphasized that wage fixing agreements and no poaching agreements could subject companies and individuals to criminal, as well as civil, actions. There has been a marked change in the federal government's approach to wage fixing agreements and no-poach agreements in the wake of the Antitrust Guidance. The DOJ was clear in its 2016 Antitrust Guidance that it intended to proceed criminally against ""naked wage fixing or no-poaching agreements"" and that it would ""criminally investigate allegations that employers have agreed among themselves on employee compensation or not to solicit or hire each other's employees."" See Antitrust Guidance at 4. Several such investigations were announced during the Trump administration, with charges being filed in the final days of the administration. As the DOJ warned, criminal charges were brought not just against companies, but against allegedly culpable individuals as well. In December 2020 the DOJ indicted Neeraj Jindal, the former owner of Integrity Home Therapy, a physical therapy staffing company, under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) for price fixing and antitrust conspiracy. See U.S. v. Jindal, 20-cr-00358-ALM-KPJ (E.D. Tex. 2020). The DOJ alleged that the company entered into agreements with competitors to suppress competition by agreeing to fix prices by lowering the pay rate of physical therapists. A month later the DOJ brought a criminal action against Surgical Care Affiliates, an operator of outpatient surgical facilities, alleging that an agreement with competitors not to poach each other's senior executives violated the same provision of the Sherman Act, this time styled as a conspiracy in restraint of trade to allocate employees. See U.S. v. Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC, et al., 21-cr-00011-L (N.D. Tex. 2021). As part of the alleged conspiracy, the DOJ claimed that between 2010 and 2017, Surgical Care Affiliates and other companies not named in the indictment had refrained from reaching out to each other's senior employees — though it appears that employees could be interviewed if they previously had informed their supervisor they were looking for a new job, and then applied for a position on their own. According to the DOJ, this was per se unlawful. Surgical Care filed a motion to dismiss that was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as amicus curiae. The DOJ filed a superseding indictment earlier this month, maintaining the per se illegality theory of liability. The Biden administration seems poised to ramp up the use of criminal indictments against companies that enter into naked no-poach agreements. On July 14, 2021, the DOJ brought charges against DaVita Inc., another health care company, and its former CEO Kent Thiry for allegedly participating in the Surgical Care Affiliates conspiracy. See U.S. v. DaVita Inc. et al., 21-cr-00229-RBJ (Dist. Colo 2021). This is just part of the Biden administration's focus on restrictive covenants. Just a few days prior to the DaVita indictment, the Biden administration released an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. The Executive Order signals a ""Whole-of-Government Competition Policy"" that will use various federal laws, including the Sherman Act, to promote competition and (where necessary) break up monopolies. The Executive Order, among other things, directs the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC to consider revising the 2016 antitrust guidance to better protect workers from wage collusion. As explained in the Fact Sheet accompanying the Executive Order, the Executive Order encourages ""the FTC and DOJ to strengthen antitrust guidance to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits by sharing wage and benefit information with one another"" and further encourages the ""FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements."" It remains to be seen how far such guidance, and prosecutions, will go — but decision makers should navigate these new waters carefully. It is now more important than ever that employers, especially those in highly concentrated markets with fewer competing businesses, have a clear understanding of the boundary between legitimate restrictive covenants and anti-competitive behavior.

Philippines reports record virus cases as Delta variant spreads,1800,"MANILA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Philippines health ministry reported a record 18,332 COVID-19 infections on Monday and for the first time acknowledged community transmission of the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus in its capital region. The region, an urban sprawl containing the capital, Manila, and 16 cities home to more than 13 million people, had been subject to strict lockdown measures which were relaxed for 10 days from Aug. 21 to allow more businesses to operate. read more ""Widespread lockdown or restrictions are no longer effective in the country,"" health ministry spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference on Monday. ""It would be more effective if restrictions were loosened a bit and if lockdowns were more targeted"". Large numbers of Delta variant cases for which the source could not be traced had been detected in the capital region and nearby provinces, the health ministry said in a separate statement. Authorities have for several weeks attributed the current rise in cases to the Delta variant, but genome sequencing capacity in the Philippines is limited, with only a few thousand samples processed weekly. On Monday, the country's genome centre said it had detected an additional 466 Delta variant cases, bringing the number of people confirmed to be carrying the variant to 1,273. The Philippines has recorded a total of 1.86 million COVID-19 cases, the statement said, a fifth of which were detected over the last 40 days. Nearly 32,000 people in the Philippines have died with COVID-19, according to official data. The number of active cases in the country increased to a four-month high of 130,350, the statement added. Of those recently tested, one in four tested positive, it said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Delta variant, having put kibosh on Fed event, begins to menace recovery",6761,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic dealt its most visible blow yet as Federal Reserve officials abruptly cancelled their premier in-person conference, raising questions about their insistence the economy faces limited risk from the Delta strain and plans to dial back crisis-era support. The setback, announced late Friday, with the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium now virtual for the second straight year, is the latest in a series of small but accumulating signs the new surge is having more of an impact than Fed officials anticipated. read more Chair Jerome Powell was already scheduled to deliver his keynote speech on Friday by webcast. It comes at a critical time as the U.S. central bank considers when to start shrinking its extraordinary support for the economy. Most policymakers had been keen to begin reducing the Fed's asset-purchase program by the end of this year, according to the minutes of the July 27-28 policy meeting. Until now, Powell has downplayed the impact of Delta. People and businesses had learned to ""live their lives, despite COVID,"" he said, indicating the central bank's outlook for an improving economy remained intact despite the resurgence in cases and uneven vaccination rates. ""People and businesses have improvised and learned to adapt,"" Powell said in an Aug. 17 webcast event with teachers and students. U.S. economic growth surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter and is likely to be revised higher later this week. That confidence could now be mislaid with the quickly evolving situation causing a dashboard of indicators to flash some potential warning signs. HIGH-FREQUENCY DATA FALTERS Nearly all of the recovery measures for individual U.S. states tracked by Oxford Economics fell for the latest week available. States in the South saw the sharpest drops, led by Louisiana, Florida, and Mississippi. ""Greater consumer caution weakened demand and mobility, which fell to multiweek lows. Employment soured, production retrenched, and the health tracker fell on surging Delta variant contagion,"" Oxford's team of U.S. economists wrote. COVID-19 deaths in the United States reached a five-month high last week as the more contagious Delta variant runs rampant in areas with low vaccination rates. Cases continue to rise and the United States, as of Friday, was averaging about 139,000 new infections each day. Small business hiring tracked by time management company Homebase has edged down, while Bank of America credit and debit card data showed a decline in spending on leisure in the last seven days. Restaurant bookings through OpenTable have also fallen in recent days. U.S. consumer sentiment also dropped sharply in early August, hitting its lowest level in a decade, with more negative outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment, a University of Michigan survey showed. ""We have made all the easy wins of reopening, and the plain fact is the virus is catching up with us. So there is some cooling ... economists got a little over-enthusiastic,"" said Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed staffer who is chief economist at BNY Mellon Asset Management. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs economists lowered their forecast for third-quarter economic growth to 5.5% from 9%, citing the Delta variant's prolonged impact, although they revised up their estimates for the fourth quarter and most of next year. Others caution not to read too much into the softening after a surge in economic activity amid the reopening and pent-up demand being released over the summer. ""So far, real-world impacts have been relatively small and localized,"" said Jefferies in its analysis of real-time data, noting declines in restaurant bookings had been led by states with large COVID-19 outbreaks, such as Florida and Texas.

On Thursday, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) delayed the return to its corporate offices to January at the earliest. read more Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, one of the central bank's most forceful supporters for reducing support for the economy, said on Friday the impact of the Delta variant was ""unfolding rapidly"" and that he may adjust his views on monetary policy ""somewhat"" should it slow economic growth materially. Kaplan has previously said he would like the Fed to begin tapering its asset purchases in October. read more SUPPLY-CHAIN ISSUES Fed policymakers are also keenly watching the handful of categories that have contributed to an outsized jump in inflation due to supply-chain bottlenecks, as well as any signs price pressures may be broadening. Many at the Fed, including Powell, maintain that current high inflation readings are temporary and will ebb back towards the central bank's 2% average goal, but some policymakers are growing more anxious. U.S. consumer price increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on an annual basis, and there were tentative signs inflation has peaked. The surge fueled by the Delta variant is pressuring that premise. China's 'zero tolerance' COVID-19 policy saw a terminal at its second-largest container port by handling volume temporarily shut down last week due to an outbreak, and several other Chinese ports faced further congestion as vessels were diverted and cargo processing slowed due to stricter disinfection measures. read more Leading international shipping groups warned clients of delays and route adjustments as global supply chains came under further strain, which could keep price pressures elevated in the United States for a range of parts and goods. The months-long shortage of global semiconductors that has pushed up prices of new and used vehicles shows no signs of abating as the Delta variant spreads across Asian countries that are home to auto factories and chip plants. Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales volumes, said on Thursday it would slash its planned global production for September by 40%, a move that impacts most of its North American factories. read more Should U.S. supply issues, including a shortage of labor, persist even as vaccinations, boosters, better treatments and healthy savings keep demand from cratering, the chances of a blunder by the Fed goes up if it is forced to quickly raise interest rates to keep a lid on inflation, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.

Japan asks Tokyo hospitals to accept more COVID-19 patients,1472,"TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Japanese government and the Tokyo Metropolitan government appealed on Monday to hospitals in the capital to accept more COVID-19 patients as increasing infections has made it increasingly difficult to get access to care. Fewer than one in 10 coronavirus patients is hospitalised in Tokyo, fuelling public frustration with the government's COVID-19 response and undermining voter support for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. read more ""The Delta variant's strong infectiousness just isn't comparable to previous ones,"" said Health Minister Norihisa Tamura, as he stood with Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. ""We would like to have further support from the medical community to secure hospital beds for coronavirus patients."" This was the first time the national government had issued such a request based on the infectious diseases control law, Tamura said. With infections showing no sign of slowing down, the government is considering expanding areas covered by state of emergency measures, the Kyodo news agency said. Emergency measures are now in force in 13 prefectures, including Tokyo. While infection numbers in Japan have been setting daily records, the number of deaths per day has stayed at less than a quarter of the record 216 fatalities seen on May 18, as more people are vaccinated. On Sunday, Japan reported 22,302 COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Boss' 'paramour preference' not discrimination - 9th Circ,4083,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Dignity Health research doctor did not engage in sex discrimination by allegedly showing favoritism toward a female researcher whom he was dating, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joining the seven other appeals courts to consider the issue, held that an employer who exhibits preferential treatment toward a supervisor's sexual or romantic partner is not liable for sex bias under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The panel rejected claims by William Maner, a former Dignity lab researcher, that the word ""sex"" in Title VII refers not only to gender but to sexual activity and that so-called ""paramour preference"" was a form of unlawful sexual harassment. ""The employer discriminates in favor of a supervisor’s sexual or romantic partner and against all other employees because they are not the favored paramour, no matter the sex of the paramour or of the complaining employees,"" Circuit Judge Carlos Bea wrote. San Francisco-based Dignity and its lawyers at Greenberg Traurig did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Carolyn Kubitschek of Lansner & Kubitschek, who represents Maner. Maner worked as a biomedical design engineer in the obstetric and gynecological laboratory of Dr. Robert Garfield for several decades, according to filings in the case. After Garfield moved his lab to the University of Texas in 1999, Maner learned that Garfield and a female lab employee were engaged in a long-term romantic relationship, according to court filings. In 2008, Garfield relocated his lab to a Dignity facility in Phoenix and arranged for his team to be transferred. At the time, Maner was facing charges of sexually assaulting his 7-year-old daughter. Maner denied the charges but pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. He was sentenced to eight years of probation, the terms of which required him to reside in Texas, according to filings. Garfield in 2010 approved a remote work arrangement for Maner allowing him to work from Texas, and the lab soon after lost some of its funding. Garfield gave Maner a highly negative performance review in 2011 and recommended that he return to Phoenix immediately or be terminated, according to court filings. Maner was fired a few months later. Maner in 2016 sued Dignity in Phoenix federal court, claiming Garfield had shielded his romantic partner from the impacts of reduced lab funding by firing Maner. U.S. District Judge David Campbell in 2018 granted summary judgment to Dignity, finding that Maner's claims were based not on his sex but on Garfield's preference for his romantic partner. Maner appealed, arguing that the term ""sex"" broadly encompasses sexual activity and not just sexual characteristics, but the 9th Circuit on Friday disagreed. To determine whether an employer discriminated based on sex, Bea wrote, the key question is whether changing the employee's sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer. But Garfield's alleged favoritism toward his partner would not have changed had Maner been a woman, the judge said. The 2nd Circuit in the 1986 case DeCintio v. Westchester County Medical Center first held that ""paramour preference"" did not violate Title VII, and the 9th Circuit on Friday became the seventh appeals court to follow suit. The panel included Circuit Judges William Fletcher and Michelle Friedland. The case is Maner v. Dignity Health, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-17159.

Swedish Health Agency sees COVID-19 spreading faster in coming months,1735,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Sweden is likely to see COVID-19 infections gain momentum in the coming months while the current curbs to limit the spread will need to be maintained until a higher proportion of the adult population is vaccinated, the Health Agency said on Monday. Sweden, which has opted against lockdowns and mostly relied on voluntary measures, has experienced a lull in the pandemic during the summer with few deaths and hospitalisations. However, cases have risen in recent weeks and that trend is expected to continue as schools reopen and people return to work. ""All our three scenarios point to increased spread during the autumn,"" the Health Agency said in a statement. ""More people are assumed to need hospital and intensive care, but at significantly lower levels than before during the pandemic."" While infections have been lower during summer, the rapid spread of the highly infectious Delta variant has seen authorities urge Swedes to remain on their guard, especially as colder weather forces people indoors. It said that current restrictions and recommendations, mainly to limit social interactions, isolate if sick and work from home if possible, should be kept in place until more people had received COVID jabs. Around 65% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. ""When the vaccination coverage rate is high enough so that healthcare does not risk being overloaded the Public Health Agency considers it reasonable to phase out most infection control measures, despite a spread of the virus,"" it said. Sweden has seen significantly higher deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours during the pandemic but lower than in most European countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"For first time since July, China reports no new local COVID-19 cases",3789,"BEIJING, Aug 23 (Reuters) - China reported no new locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 on Monday for the first time since July, a sign the current outbreak may be waning amid Beijing's 'zero-tolerance' stance and tough anti-virus measures across the country. More than 1,200 people have been confirmed infected in an outbreak that officials said has been mainly driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, which was brought in from abroad and caused a cluster in late July in the eastern city of Nanjing. No deaths have been reported in the outbreak. But it spurred authorities across the country to impose counter-epidemic measures including mass testing for millions of people to identify and isolate carriers, as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees. Economists have said they expect to see those steps cutting into growth in the world's second-biggest economy in the quarter ending September. Across China, new daily local cases fell to the single-digit level last week, after peaking in early August. Since the weekend, authorities have lifted lockdowns in a few areas in Beijing, as well as in the cities Wuhan and Jingmen in central Hubei province, after these cities had sealed up some areas to contain the virus. Sichuan has allowed travel agencies to resume tours to outside the province, barring places still deemed of risk. By contrast, Shanghai placed hundreds of people under quarantine over the weekend after some fresh infections were reported, sparking concerns of a fresh outbreak in the city. Still, Shanghai reported no new local infections for Aug. 22. read more ACCUSTOMED TO DISRUPTION Experts do not expect China to alter its zero-tolerance playbook in the near future - even when facing just a handful of local infections. ""Although China's current (COVID containment) policy is characterised by a high degree of disruption as well as cost, a suite of effective measures has been established, which I don't think will be abandoned easily,"" said Chen Zhengming, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford. ""Inspections at customs, quarantine, the mobilisation of communities, mass testing, etc, one round, two rounds, and then three rounds, China has grown accustomed to them,"" Chen told Reuters. The number of scheduled domestic flights for August has fallen 19% from a year earlier, according to global aviation data company Cirium, after the latest outbreak dented demand for travel and authorities allowed bookings to be cancelled free-of-charge. read more Flights in and out of Nanjing and Yangzhou remained suspended as of Monday, although Nanjing said on Sunday that it no longer required people leaving the city by rail or by highway to show negative COVID-19 test results. ""Ordinary people are basically used to the measures without having too many complaints. And the effectiveness (of those measures) is discernible - case numbers recently have significantly declined,"" the University of Oxford's Chen said, though adding he doubted whether China could afford to impose such measures in the long run. In the stock market, mainland China shares bounced back on Monday after last week's sharp drop. L4N2PU17J Including new infections detected among travellers arriving in mainland China, the National Health Commission reported on Monday a total of 21 new confirmed cases for Aug. 22, down from 32 a day earlier. China reported 16 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, which it does not classify as confirmed infections until they show signs of infection such as a fever. That is down from 19 a day earlier. The new asymptomatic cases were all imported. Mainland China as of Aug. 22 has recorded 94,652 confirmed cases, with a death toll of 4,636, unchanged since late January.

Philippines approves emergency use of Russia's Sputnik Light vaccine,1307,"MANILA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Philippines has approved the emergency use of Russia's Sputnik Light COVID-19 vaccine, the country's vaccine procurement chief said on Monday, making it among the first countries in Asia to approve the single-dose vaccine. The approval by the Philippines' food and drug agency will allow the country to follow up its order for 10 million doses, Carlito Galvez, a retired general who handles the government's vaccine procurement, told a news conference. The government expects vaccine manufacturers to increase deliveries in September and October, Galvez said. Mongolia and Kazakhstan have approved Sputnik Light, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Institute. Sputnik Light is ninth COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Philippines, along with vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and China's Sinovac and Sinopharm. Philippine authorities have said the vaccine rollout is key to the recovery of the Southeast Asian country's economy. The Philippines was one of the fastest growing economies in Asia before the pandemic, but contracted by a record 9.6% in 2020. The Philippines has so far fully vaccinated 17.26 million people, leaving much of its 110 million population vulnerable to the highly contagious Delta variant.

Taiwan's president leads way in first domestic COVID-19 vaccine,3380,"TAIPEI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - President Tsai Ing-wen got vaccinated with Taiwan's first domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, giving her personal stamp of approval as the island begins rolling out the shot whose approval critics say has been rushed. The health ministry last month approved the emergency use of Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp's (6547.TWO) COVID-19 vaccine, part of a broader plan for inoculation self-sufficiency as delays in vaccine deliveries from global drug companies have affected Taiwan and many other countries. Tsai, who had held off using vaccines from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) or AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), the current mainstay of Taiwan's vaccination programme, received her Medigen shot at a hospital in central Taipei, demonstrating her confidence in the safety of the vaccine. Tsai chatted to medical workers as they prepared her shot, the whole process being broadcast live on her Facebook page, and gave a short response of ""no"" to a shouted question from reporters about whether she was nervous. ""It doesn't hurt, I'm in good spirits, and I'm going to continue working for the day,"" she later wrote on Facebook. The government says the initial experience of the pandemic last year, when basic supplies such as face masks were in short supply, made it realise they had to be able to rely on themselves for critical materials. Medigen, whose Chinese name literally means ""high-end"", rejects claims its vaccine is either unsafe or that it has been sent to market with undue haste, saying it is effective and well tested. ""We have done so many experiments, everyone has seen how safe our vaccine is,"" Medigen's Chief Executive Officer Charles Chen told Reuters. CONCERNS The recombinant protein vaccine has been developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and the government has ordered an initial 5 million doses. It says nobody will be forced to get it. The vaccine has yet to finish clinical trials and no efficacy data is available, but the government says studies so far have shown that antibodies created by the shot have been ""no worse than"" those created by AstraZeneca's vaccine. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, has mounted a fierce campaign against the shot, saying that while it supports domestic vaccines, Medigen's approval has been rushed. ""There is no need for the lives and health of the Taiwanese people to serve as white rats in a laboratory,"" Ho Chih-yung, deputy head of the KMT's international department, told Reuters. Around 40% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one shot of either of the two-dose AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccines, though fewer than 5% are fully vaccinated. However, unlike some other parts of Asia, Taiwan faces no huge pressure to accelerate its vaccination drive, with domestic infections well under control. It has reported 15,932 infections since the pandemic began, including 828 deaths. Taiwan has received more than 10 million vaccine doses to date, and in July ordered a further 36 million doses of Moderna's. read more People who spoke to Reuters in Taipei after getting the Medigen shot said they had no particular concerns about it.

Growth in French business activity eased in August -PMI,1813,"PARIS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Growth in French business activity eased in August compared to July, according to initial forecasts in a monthly survey, as problems with supplies of goods and COVID-19 health protocols impacted trade. Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for France's dominant services sector fell to 56.4 points in August from 56.8 in July -- below a forecast for an August reading of 57.0 points. The August preliminary manufacturing PMI also fell to 57.3 points from 58.0 in July, below a forecast for 57.8 points. The overall August preliminary composite PMI fell to 55.9 points from 56.6 in July, although overall the PMI figures remained above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction. Problems with global shipping and transport have resulted in supply chain issues for many companies around the world. Several Chinese ports are facing congestion as vessels due to call at Ningbo are being diverted and cargo processing is slowed, partly due to stricter disinfection measures under China's ""zero-tolerance"" coronavirus policy. read more Some French businesses are also struggling with rules requiring customers to hold a COVID-19 health pass to eat or drink in a restaurant or enter a shop. read more ""Another strong month of growth across France was signalled by the flash PMI figure for August,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes. ""There are, however, factors holding back growth to some extent.

"Biden pledges evacuation support, Taliban beat back crowds at airport",5484,"KABUL/WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The United States has an unwavering commitment to getting U.S. citizens and at-risk Afghans out of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden said, as Taliban fighters beat back thousands desperate to flee outside Kabul airport on Sunday. Biden said the security situation in Afghanistan was changing rapidly and his administration was under no illusions about the threat from Islamic State militants in Afghanistan known as ISIS-K (for Khorasan). The Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after a 20-year war, fired in the air and used batons to force people to form queues outside the airport, witnesses said. On Saturday, seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates. A NATO official said at least 20 people had died in the past seven days in and around the airport. Some were shot and others died in stampedes, witnesses have said. ""Let me be clear, the evacuation of thousands from Kabul is going to be hard and painful"" and would have been ""no matter when it began,"" Biden said in a briefing at the White House. ""We have a long way to go and a lot could still go wrong."" Biden said he had directed the State Department to contact Americans stranded in Afghanistan by phone, email and other means, and the United States had a plan to move them to the airport. ""We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound. For security reasons, I'm not going to go into detail ... but I will say again today what I've said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home."" Afghan allies of the West and vulnerable Afghans such as women activists and journalists would be helped too, he said. On Sunday, there were no major injuries as gunmen beat back the crowds, according to witnesses. The Taliban had been ""cooperative"" about extending the airport perimeter, Biden said. Asked by a reporter whether the United States would extend an Aug. 31 deadline for evacuations, Biden replied: ""Our hope is we will not have to extend but there are going to be discussions I suspect on how far along we are in the process."" CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT The United States on Sunday sought the help of six commercial airlines to transport people after their evacuation from Afghanistan. Biden said people were being assisted by more than two dozen countries in four continents. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a virtual meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations for Tuesday to ""ensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people"". A member of Taliban (C) stands outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, August 16, 2021. REUTERS/Stringer Britain plans to push world leaders to consider new sanctions on the Taliban when the G7 meets, sources told Reuters. Biden said he would support that effort, depending on the conduct of the Taliban. Panicked Afghans have tried to board flights out of Kabul since last weekend, fearing reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law the Sunni Muslim group exercised while in power two decades ago. Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government. OPPOSITION They face opposition from forces in northern Afghanistan, which said this weekend they had taken three districts close to the Panjshir valley. Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Massoud said on Sunday he hoped to hold peaceful talks with the Islamist movement but that his forces in the Panjshir - remnants of army units, special forces and militiamen - were ready to fight. ""We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation,"" he said. ""We do not want a war to break out."" The Taliban said hundreds of their fighters were heading towards Panjshir, showing a video on Twitter of a column of captured trucks with the white Taliban flag but still bearing their government markings moving along a highway. The United States and other countries including Britain have brought in several thousand troops to help evacuate foreign citizens and at-risk Afghans from Kabul, but have been careful to avoid clashes with the Taliban. A Taliban official said: ""We are seeking complete clarity on foreign forces' exit plan"". Taliban political office spokesman Mohammed Naeem told Saudi-owned Al Hadath TV that talks are ongoing with the United States and other countries. He said al Qaeda is not present in Afghanistan and the Taliban has no relationship with it. Afghans who fled in the past week have spoken about their despair at leaving loved ones behind. ""It was very difficult to leave,"" a veiled woman told Reuters in Qatar. ""I love my country."" The World Health Organization and U.N. children's agency UNICEF called for a humanitarian air bridge to deliver aid to Afghanistan to help more than 18 million people in need. U.S. Army Major General William Taylor said on Saturday that the United States in the past week had evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, from Kabul. On one of the flights, an Afghan woman gave birth on board moments after landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Saturday, the U.S. Air Force said on Twitter. The woman delivered a baby girl in the cargo bay of a C-17 aircraft. The mother and baby were in good condition, the tweet said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Turkey reinforces border to block any Afghan migrant wave,4418,"VAN, Turkey, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Afghans who manage to make the weeks-long journey through Iran on foot to the Turkish border face a three-metre high wall, ditches or barbed wire as Turkish authorities step up efforts to block any refugee influx into the country. The beefed up border measures in Turkey, which already hosts nearly 4 million Syrian refugees and is a staging post for many migrants trying to reach Europe, began as the Taliban started advancing in Afghanistan and took over Kabul last week. Authorities plan to add another 64 km by the end of the year to a border wall started in 2017. Ditches, wire and security patrols around the clock will cover the rest of the 560 km frontier. ""We want to show the whole world that our borders are unpassable,"" Mehmet Emin Bilmez, governor of the eastern border province of Van, told Reuters at the weekend. ""Our biggest hope is that there is no migrant wave from Afghanistan."" Turkey is not the only country putting up barriers: Its neighbour Greece has just completed a 40-km fence and surveillance system to keep out migrants who still manage to enter Turkey and try to reach the European Union. read more Authorities say there are 182,000 registered Afghan migrants in Turkey and up to an estimated 120,000 unregistered ones. President Tayyip Erdogan urged European countries to take responsibility for any new influx, warning that Turkey had no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The number of irregular Afghan migrants detained in Turkey so far this year is less than a fifth of the number detained in 2019, and officials say they have not yet seen signs of a major surge since last week's Taliban victory, though the long distances mean refugees could take weeks to arrive. The Turkish side of the mountainous border with Iran is lined by bases and watchtowers. Patrol cars monitor around the clock for movement on the Iranian side, from where migrants, smugglers and Kurdish militants frequently try to cross into Turkey. Migrants who are spotted getting through at the border are returned to the Iranian side, though most return and try again, according to security forces. ""No matter how many high-level measures you take, there may be those who evade them from time to time,"" Bilmez said.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer 'LET US STAY' Roads leading from the border are lined with checkpoints. Migrants who make it through are hidden by smugglers in houses - often dirty, ramshackle buildings underground or in deep dried riverbeds - waiting to be moved to western Turkey. On Saturday police captured 25 migrants, mostly Afghans, behind a dilapidated building in Van's Hacibekir neighbourhood. ""We thought we will have facilities here, we will earn to support our parents. There, there are Taliban to kill us,"" said 20-year-old Zaynullah, one of those detained. He said he arrived in Turkey two days earlier after travelling on foot for 80 days. Those captured are taken for health and security checks at a processing centre. There Seyyed Fahim Mousavi, a 26-year-old, said he fled his home in Kabul a month ago, before the Taliban came, fearing they would kill him because he had worked as a driver for the Americans and Turks. His 22-year-old wife, Morsal, said they took the journey through Iran mostly on foot to escape the Taliban. ""They harm women. After raping them, they kill them. They behead the men,"" she said, holding her two children, aged two and five. ""We don't want to go back. Just let us stay here."" After processing, migrants are taken to a repatriation centre, where they can spend up to 12 months before being sent back to their home country. Those repatriations have been halted for Afghans now, leaving around 7,500 Afghans in limbo in various repatriation centres. Ramazan Secilmis, deputy head of the migration directorate, said his organisation was working to identify those who need protection from the Taliban to relocate them to third countries. ""Those who need protection need to be separated from those who come to our country due to economic reasons. We cannot deport anyone automatically just because they have Afghan nationality,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
N.Korea develops its own PCR equipment for COVID-19 tests -state media,1595,"SEOUL, Aug 23 (Reuters) - North Korea has developed its own Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment to conduct coronavirus tests, state media said on Monday, as the country steps up efforts to head off more contagious new strains of the virus. The isolated country has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but has sealed borders, restricted travel and imposed strict prevention measures, seeing the pandemic as a matter of national survival. As part of the anti-virus efforts, scientists and technicians at the State Academy of Sciences have developed the PCR system that meets global standards for the first time, said the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Worker's Party's newspaper. The equipment was introduced as one of recent achievements made under leader Kim Jong Un's push to localise machinery, tools and materials amid international sanctions and border closures that sharply reduced trade. North Korea has run PCR tests as an internationally recognised standard COVID-19 diagnostic method, but received outside assistance including from the World Health Organization (WHO). The official KCNA news agency also said on Monday that North Korea is stepping up its battle against the virus to ward off the highly transmissible Delta and Lambda variants spreading around the world. ""Plans are under way to normalise disinfection and prevent disorderly movement of people and supplies at offices and workplaces, while education and control is being intensified to ensure all people obey rules including wearing masks at public spaces,"" KCNA said.

"Exit polls show ally of Japan's Suga losing Yokohama election, NHK says",1921,"TOKYO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - An ally of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was set to lose a mayoral race in Yokohama on Sunday, public broadcaster NHK said, citing exit polls, in a blow for the unpopular premier who faces a general election this year. Exit polls pointed to a clear victory for the opposition-backed professor of public health Takeharu Yamanaka, NHK said. The field of eight candidates included politician Hachiro Okonogi, who ran with Suga's backing, as well as incumbent mayor Fumiko Hayashi. Polls closed at 8:00 p.m. local time (1100 GMT). The projected loss for Okonogi on the premier's home turf just south of Tokyo is likely to pile more pressure on Suga, who was already under fire over surging COVID-19 cases and a perception that he has been clumsy in handling the pandemic. Suga's approval ratings slid below 30% in August, fanning concerns in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party about his ability to lead the party into a general election that must be held by Nov. 28. Suga, who took office last September after predecessor Shinzo Abe quit citing ill health, is struggling to contain the pandemic, with national daily infections hitting a record 25,000 last week. Although Yokohama is in Suga's constituency in parliament, a survey conducted by a local newspaper in mid-August found Okonogi trailing Yamanaka, reflecting concerns over the government's handling of the pandemic. Kanagawa, the prefecture where Yokohama is located, has been under a state of emergency since Aug. 2, but infections have continued to rise. The prefecture recorded a record 2,878 cases on Friday, according to public broadcaster NHK. Suga's term as LDP president ends in September.

Swedish PM to step down in November ahead of 2022 elections,2909,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven caught many off guard on Sunday, saying he would resign in November ahead of a general election in September 2022 to give his successor a chance to improve the Social Democrats' standing in the polls. Lofven has been prime minister since 2014, heading two coalition governments with the Green Party that have lurched from crisis to crisis, unable to command a majority in parliament. The most recent setback saw Lofven, a former welder and union leader, resign in June after losing a no-confidence vote. He was returned to office by parliament in July when the leader of the biggest opposition party, the Moderates, failed to get enough backing to form a new government. read more ""In next year's election campaign the Social Democrats will be led by someone else than me,"" Lofven said at the end of his annual summer speech. ""Everything has an end and I want to give my successor the very best conditions."" He said he would step down at the party's congress in November. Lofven's Social Democrats have dominated Swedish politics for generations, but their support - like that of left-of-centre parties across much of Europe - has gradually eroded. In addition, the rise of the Sweden Democrats, a populist, anti-immigration party, has made forming majority governments almost impossible. The Social Democrats will probably benefit ahead of the elections from having a new leader, Uppsala University political scientist Torsten Svensson told Reuters. ""The fact he takes the initiative himself, not resigning after explicit demands for it, and the fact they get to launch the election campaign with a new face is a big plus,"" he said. Lofven's possible successors include current Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, Health Minister Lena Hallengren and Minister of the Interior Mikael Damberg, he said. Lofven took over the leadership of the Social Democrats in 2012, when their support was at an all-time low and managed to return them to power after eight years of centre-right rule. He got a second term in 2018, but only when two centre-right parties swapped sides, leaving Lofven caught between their demands and those of the Left Party, whose support he has also needed. His successor is likely to have similar problems as opinion polls show the centre-right and centre-left blocs still deadlocked. The government currently does not have the support it will need to pass a budget in the autumn. Magnus Hagevi, political scientist at the Linnaeus University, said the resignation was not a surprise considering that Lofven had been on the job for a long time. ""He does this at a time that gives the successor a chance to step into his shoes ahead of the next parliamentary election,"" he said, adding that possible successors include Energy Minister Anders Ygeman as well as Andersson.

"Saudi Arabia pledges to provide support for Tunisia, Tunisian presidency says",1651,"TUNIS, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia pledged on Sunday to provide assistance to Tunisia, which is suffering a political, economic and health crisis, the Tunisian presidency said on Sunday, the latest sign of support for President Kais Saied against his Islamist opponents. Saudi State Minister for African Affairs Ahmed Abdul Aziz Kattan met Saied in Tunis and senior officials held talks afterward to discuss cooperation, the presidency said in a statement. Saied last month dismissed his prime minister, froze parliament and assumed executive authority in a sudden intervention that his Islamist opponents have labeled a coup but that he said was necessary to save the country from collapse. The statement did not give any details of the assistance that could be provided by Saudi Arabia, which has reiterated that it supports Saied's decisions aimed at protecting the country. Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz said earlier this month that his country would give Tunisia one million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and Saudi has also established an air bridge to provide medical aid for the North Africa country. Tunisia is struggling with an unprecedented fiscal deficit, which reached 11.4% last year. It is also on the verge of bankruptcy, needing at least $3 billion this year to pay off foreign debts and the wages of hundreds of thousands of employees in the public sector. Some Gulf states saw Saied's intervention as undermining the Muslim Brotherhood movement, which they regard as their main regional foe, and which is close to the biggest party in Tunisia's now frozen parliament.

South Korea to get more Moderna COVID shots in boost to vaccination effort,1727,"SEOUL, Aug 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's health ministry said on Sunday that Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) will supply the country with 7.01 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by the first week of September, following a government request to speed up delivery. Some 1.01 million doses are expected to arrive on Monday, the ministry said, with another 6 million to be supplied sequentially. Moderna delivered 1.3 million doses earlier this month. It had at the time informed South Korea that it would only be able to deliver less than half the 8.5 million doses it had been due to ship in August. read more ""In response to our request to speed up and expand the vaccine supply, Moderna informed us that it will supply 7.01 million doses by the first week of September,"" the ministry said in a statement. Under the plan, the country will be able to give 36 million people at least one dose of the vaccine before the Sept. 20-22 Chuseok holiday. The statement also said that the government is currently in talks with Romania for a vaccine swap deal, but denied a local media report that said the Romanian government approved donation of 450,000 doses of Moderna vaccines. It gave no details of the planned swap, saying more information on the discussion with Romania will be provided as soon as it is finalised. On Saturday South Korea reported 1,628 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 236,366. A total of 2,215 people have died so far. As of Saturday midnight, 50.4% of the 52 million population have had at least one dose of vaccine, while just 22.5% have been fully vaccinated, government data showed.

Australian PM Morrison defends lockdown strategy as daily cases hit record,2950,"MELBOURNE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Australia will stick to its lockdown strategy against the coronavirus until at least 70% of its population is fully vaccinated, but after that it will have to start living with the virus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday. The country set a record with 914 infections, its highest daily figure, as the southern and eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory remain under a strict lockdown. ""You can't live with lockdowns forever and at some point, you need to make that gear change, and that is done at 70%,"" Morrison said in a television interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corp's Insider program. Lockdowns are a key element of the federal government's strategy to rein in outbreaks until the 70% percent level is reached, with borders being re-opened gradually when the figure climbs to 80%. read more . But in a departure from the zero-COVID strategy adopted since the pandemic began, Morrison said it was highly unlikely for Australia to reach zero cases before curbs can be eased. ""Lockdowns are not a sustainable way to deal with the virus and that's why we have to get to the 70% and 80% marks, so we can start living with the virus,"" he added. About 60% of the population of 25 million is now under lockdown. Stay-at-home orders, often lasting for months, have taxed the patience of many. Police officers patrol the quiet city centre during a lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Sydney, Australia, August 18, 2021.

New South Wales saw 830 new infections on Sunday, despite stepped-up efforts, and the Australian Capital Territory, home to the capital, Canberra, had 19. Nationwide, the tally of active cases stands at nearly 12,000. The southeastern state of Victoria, in its sixth lockdown since the start of the pandemic, recorded 65 locally acquired cases on Sunday. ""We are throwing everything at this,"" said Martin Foley, the state's health minister. Just about 30% of Australians older than 16 have been fully vaccinated, health ministry data showed on Saturday. This is mainly because the Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine is in short supply and the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine provokes public unease. Despite a third wave of infections from the Delta variant, Australia's COVID-19 numbers are relatively low, with just under 44,000 cases and 981 deaths.

Israeli aircraft strike Hamas sites in Gaza after border clashes,2845,"TEL AVIV, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck Hamas sites in Gaza late on Saturday, the military said, in an escalation of hostilities after earlier cross-border gunfire seriously injured an Israeli soldier and wounded 41 Palestinians, including two critically. The injuries came during a Gaza protest organised by the enclave's Islamist rulers Hamas and other factions in support of Jerusalem, where Palestinian clashes with Israeli police helped spark an 11-day Israel-Hamas conflict in May. Hundreds of Palestinians gathered near the Strip's heavily fortified border, where some tried to scale the border fence and others threw explosives towards Israeli troops, the Israeli military said. ""IDF (Israeli military) troops responded with riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire,"" it said in a statement. Among the two Palestinians critically injured was a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the head, Gaza's health ministry said. It described most of the other injuries as moderate, including gun shots to limbs, backs and abdomens. Cross-border fire from Gaza seriously wounded an Israeli border police soldier, who is in hospital receiving medical treatment, the military said. There was no claim of responsibility for the Gaza gunfire. In response to the soldier's shooting, Israeli ""fighter jets have struck four weapons storage and manufacturing sites belonging to"" Hamas, the military said. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Bracing for more hostilities, the military said it had sent additional forces to the Gaza border area. Israeli media reported the military had increased deployment of its Iron Dome anti-missile system. The violence follows an Israeli announcement of a resumption of Qatari aid to Gaza, a move seen as bolstering a fragile Egyptian-mediated truce to the May fighting. read more Just days before that announcement, Gaza militants launched a rocket towards Israel that was shot down by the Iron Dome, in the first such attack since the truce. read more Palestinians have also sporadically launched fire-laden balloons towards Israel since the fighting, drawing Israeli strikes on Hamas sites. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Saturday's air strikes showed Israel was ""trying to cover up its failure and disappointment in front of the steadfastness of our people and their valiant resistance."" At least 250 Palestinians and 13 in Israel were killed in the May conflict, in which Gaza militants fired rockets towards Israeli cities and Israel carried out air strikes across the coastal enclave. Israel keeps Gaza under a blockade, tightly restricting movement out of the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians. Egypt also maintains restrictions on the enclave.

Protesters in France demonstrate against COVID pass for sixth weekend,1511,"PARIS, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Thousands demonstrated across France for a sixth consecutive weekend on Saturday against a COVID-19 health pass required for daily activities, highlighting a simmering political risk for President Emmanuel Macron. The Interior Ministry said around 175,500 people in total demonstrated on Saturday - down from roughly 215,000 last weekend although numbers could increase as people return from summer holidays. The health pass is official documentation, with a QR scan code, that proves a person has had the COVID-19 vaccine. Many French bars, restaurants, museums and sports venues will not allow people inside unless they can show the health pass. While the majority of people in France have been vaccinated against COVID-19, demonstrators argue the health pass discriminates against those who have not, and infringes upon people's liberties. ""This health pass divides French people. I think that is clear. And unfortunately, I believe we should abolish it,"" said civil servant Sophie Soulas at the Paris protest. The protests have united a disparate group against the health pass, which is designed to encourage more people to get vaccinated and protect France against a fourth wave of the virus. The biggest demonstration in Paris was led by far-right politician Florian Philippot, head of 'Les Patriotes' party, while there was also a demonstration by left-wing protesters linked to the 'Yellow Vests' ('Gilets Jaunes') movement.

Police arrest hundreds of protesters as Australia reports record COVID-19 cases,3523,"MELBOURNE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australian police arrested hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters in Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday and seven officers were hospitalised as a result of clashes, as the country saw its highest ever single-day rise in COVID-19 cases. Mounted police used pepper spray in Melbourne to break up crowds of more than 4,000 surging toward police lines, while smaller groups of protesters were prevented from congregating in Sydney by a large contingent of riot police. Victoria state police said that they arrested 218 people in the state capital Melbourne. They issued 236 fines and kept three people in custody for assaulting police. The arrested people face fines of A$5,452 ($3,900) each for breaching public health orders. Police in New South Wales, where Sydney is the capital, said they charged 47 people with breaching public health orders or resisting arrest, among other offences, and issued more than 260 fines ranging from A$50 ($35) to $3,000. The police said about 250 people made it to the city for the protest. Sydney, Australia's biggest city with more than 5 million people, has been in a strict lockdown for more than two months, failing to contain an outbreak that has spread across internal borders and as far as neighbouring New Zealand. The vast majority of the 894 cases reported across Australia on Saturday were found in Sydney, the epicentre of the Delta variant-fuelled outbreak. ""We are in a very serious situation here in New South Wales,"" said state Health Minister Brad Hazzard. ""There is no time now to be selfish, it's time to think of the broader community and your families."" Police patrolled Sydney's streets and blocked private and public transport into the city centre to reduce the number of people gathering at an unauthorised protest. In Melbourne, the country's second-most populous city, a large crowd managed to march and some clashed with police, after state Premier Daniel Andrews expanded a city lockdown to the entire state. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier warned people to stay away from the protest, adding it was ""just ridiculous to think that people would be so selfish and come and do this."" Several hundred people also protested peacefully in Brisbane, which is not in lockdown. Just 7% of Australians support the often-violent protests, according to a late-July poll by market research firm Utting Research. Compliance with public health rules has been one of the key cited reasons behind Australia's success, relative to other rich countries, in managing the pandemic. But the country has been struggling to rein in the third wave of infections that began in Sydney in mid-June. Australia has had about 43,000 COVID-19 cases and 978 deaths. But while those numbers are low, only about a third of Australians aged 16 and above have been fully vaccinated, according to federal health ministry data released on Saturday. New South Wales officials reported three deaths and 516 people in hospital on Saturday. Of the 85 people in intensive care, 76 were unvaccinated, officials said. At least 96 people were active in the community during their infectious period, and there were a number of breaches of public health orders, all slowing the efforts to curtail the outbreak. In Victoria, at least 39 people were active in the community while infectious. Eighteen people were in hospital, eight in intensive care and six on ventilators.

The city-state had a cumulative $24.1 billion of investments approved there as of 2020, according to official Myanmar data since 1988. That made it the biggest source of foreign capital there, ahead of China. However, Balakrishnan said Singapore's ""so-called leverage was overestimated"", because the total also included multinationals that have invested in Myanmar.

The appointment of Ismail Sabri, 61, restores the role to a party tainted by graft accusations, after he secured a parliamentary majority from the same alliance that collapsed this week and replaced Muhyiddin Yassin. Ismail Sabri, formerly Muhyiddin's deputy, was sworn in at the national palace after beingpicked by King Al-Sultan Abdullah, the constitutional monarch.

"New Zealand reports 21 local COVID-19 cases, more expected",1699,"Aug 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand recorded 21 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warning the number will go higher in the next few days and urging the Pacific nation to adhere to the lockdown rules. The infections in the community outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant now total 51. Of the 21 new cases, 18 are in the largest city, Auckland, and three in the capital, Wellington. Ardern on Friday extended the lockdown for the country of 5.1 million until midnight on Tuesday as the outbreak widened beyond the two key cities. ""One of the things that we've learned from New South Wales is that the virus can continue to spread during lockdown,"" Ardern said of an outbreak in neighbouring Australia's most-populous state. New South Wales on Saturday logged a record 825 cases as a Delta outbreak surges despite weeks-long lockdown. read more ""No one wants an extended lockdown and no one wants to see that rate of transmission, so the number one thing everyone can do right now is reduce down your contacts,"" Ardern said. New Zealand's outbreak has been linked to a traveller from Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. New Zealanders had been living virus-free and without curbs until Ardern on Tuesday ordered what was initially a three-day nationwide lockdown and a seven-day shutdown for Auckland, after the discovery of the first case since February. The country has recorded just over 2,600 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 COVID-19 deaths, according to the health ministry. Only 19% of the population has been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Toronto's hospital network to sack employees unvaccinated at end of October,1015,"Aug 20 (Reuters) - A healthcare network that operates several hospitals in Toronto said on Friday it would sack any staff members who are not fully vaccinated by the end of October. The University Health Network (UHN), which includes the Toronto General hospital and the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, said employees who are not vaccinated by Oct. 8 will be placed on unpaid leave for two weeks. They will then be terminated if their vaccination status does not change by the end of the month. Several Canadian companies have mandated in recent weeks that employees must be fully vaccinated by the fall in an effort to fight the Delta variant. The federal government last week said it will soon require all federal public servants and many other workers to be vaccinated. read more The health network said it had contacted over 900 staff members who hadn't provided their vaccination status, adding that employees must have received their first dose by Sept 8.

"Euro 2020 final at Wembley was a ""superspreader"" event",2152,"LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Euro 2020 soccer final between England and Italy in July was a ""superspreader"" event due to the level of COVID-19 infection found in or around London's Wembley Stadium on the day, according to official data published on Friday. Public Health England said 2,295 people were likely to have been infectious with a further 3,404 people potentially acquiring infection at the July 11 match. ""Euros final was superspreader event,"" declared the Times newspaper. The match, with a crowd of around 67,000 inside the stadium, was England's first final in an international soccer tournament since the country hosted and won the 1966 World Cup. ""Euro 2020 was a unique occasion and it is unlikely we would see a similar impact on COVID-19 cases from future events,"" said Jenifer Smith, Public Health England's deputy medical director, in a statement. ""However, the data does show how easily the virus can spread when there is close contact and this should be a warning to us all as we try and return to a cautious normality once again."" Other trial events over a four-month period showed far fewer positive tests, and were either broadly in line with or lower than national averages. The British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone in July drew a 350,000-strong crowd, the largest in Britain in more than 18 months, over three days and had 585 cases recorded by NHS Test and Trace. Of those cases, 343 were likely to have already been infectious around the time of the event and the rest likely to have acquired an infection then. The Wimbledon tennis championships, with around 300,000 people attending over the two weeks, recorded 881 cases. ""We've shown that we can reintroduce mass sports and cultural events safely but it is important that people remain cautious when mixing in very crowded settings,"" said Culture Minister Oliver Dowden.

Cuba grants emergency approval to second homegrown vaccine,1992,"HAVANA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Cuba's drug regulator granted emergency approval for its homegrown Soberana 2 vaccine on Friday, allowing the drug's full inclusion in the country's inoculation program as it races to curb a Delta variant-fueled coronavirus outbreak. The Soberana vaccine, which Cuba says has an efficacy rate of 91.2%, has already been used to vaccinate some health workers and ordinary citizens in areas with high rates of transmission as part of early intervention studies. Approval by the Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices means the drug, comprised of two initial shots and a booster, can be included in the national vaccine program and could also help licensing abroad. Cuba's healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the recent COVID-19 outbreak, struggling with a lack of oxygen, medicines, doctors and equipment. Just a quarter of the population of around 11 million has been fully vaccinated. The country currently has one of the highest rates of officially confirmed cases and deaths per capita in the world, even though it managed to keep both low for much of last year. The real numbers are likely even higher, according to reports from various provinces as the latest outbreak has outpaced its testing capacity. Health Minister Jose Angel Portal said this week the official death toll likely fell short because it only included people who had formally tested positive for COVID-19 before death, state-run newspaper Invasor reported. The Soberana 2 vaccine was approved last month for emergency use in Iran, which struck a deal with Cuba to produce the drug on an industrial scale in the Islamic republic. A second locally produced COVID-19 vaccine, Abdala, which Cuba says has a 92.28 % efficacy rate was approved by the Cuban regulator for use last month. Late phase clinical trial data showing efficacy rates for either vaccine has yet to be published in peer-reviewed journals. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Appeals court rejects latest bid to halt U.S. eviction moratorium,2229,"WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a bid by groups representing landlords to halt the latest moratorium on residential evictions imposed by President Joe Biden's administration, setting up a U.S. Supreme Court showdown. In a written order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency request by two chapters of the National Association of Realtors to stop the COVID-19 pandemic-related eviction ban set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The moratorium, implemented after a previous one lapsed at the end of July, is due to expire on Oct. 3. Realtor groups in Alabama and Georgia were among those challenging the moratorium. The appellate court's order sets the stage for the Supreme Court to hear arguments over whether the administration overstepped its authority by issuing the moratorium. A general view of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia September 30, 2014. REUTERS/Tami Chappell Hours after the order issued, the realtor groups asked the Supreme Court to issue an emergency order lifting the moratorium, saying in a court filing that ""Congress never gave the CDC the staggering amount of power it claims."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the Biden administration is ""pleased that the circuit court joined the district court in leaving the moratorium in place that is keeping hard-pressed Americans in their homes in areas of substantial or high COVID-19 spread."" Under heavy political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration reversed course on Aug. 3 and issued a slightly narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Biden initially had said that congressional action was needed to renew the moratorium, but his administration reversed course. The current moratorium covers nearly 92% of U.S. counties, but that could change based on COVID-19 conditions. The CDC first issued a moratorium in September 2020 after a prior one approved by Congress expired, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic."
Florida Board of Education gives school districts ultimatum on masks,2384,"Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Florida Board of Education on Friday told two school districts they would have some of their state funding withheld if they failed within the next 48 hours to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that their children wear masks. School boards in Broward and Alachua counties have mandated masks in schools in defiance of an executive order issued last month by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that barred local officials from imposing mask mandates. Like some other Republican governors, DeSantis has called mask-wearing a personal choice which, for students, should be made by parents. ""These are the initial consequences to their intentional refusal to follow state law and state rule to purposefully and willingly violate the rights of parents,"" Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran said in a statement on Friday. The order was the latest development in the raging debate over mask-wearing in some U.S. states where the coronavirus further exposed deep political fault lines. Earlier this week, the state Board of Education voted unanimously to punish the two counties for mandating masks. It said on Friday that both school districts will be required to provide the commissioner of education with information regarding the salaries of school board members within 48 hours, with the intent of cutting their pay. The Florida Department of Education ""will then begin to withhold from state funds, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to 1/12 of the total annual compensation of the school board members who voted to impose the unlawful mask mandates until each district demonstrates compliance,"" the statement said. In a tweet, President Joe Biden expressed solidarity with the two school districts. ""American Rescue Plan funds can be used to backfill the salaries of the brave Florida school board members, superintendents, and other educators keeping our children safe,"" he wrote. Florida is battling a resurgence of COVID-19 spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant, which is spreading infections mostly among the unvaccinated. Coronavirus hospitalizations have increased by 28% in the past two weeks, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The state has reported more than 2.91 million COVID-19 cases, trailing only Texas and California. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"SpineFrontier execs arrested, charged with kickback scheme",3147,"(Reuters) - Two executives of Massachusetts spinal implant company SpineFrontier Inc were arrested Tuesday on charges of bribing surgeons to use their products by paying them sham consulting fees, federal prosecutors announced. SpineFrontier founder and chief executive officer Kingsley Chin, 57, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and chief financial officer Aditya Humad, 36, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as the company itself, were accused in an indictment in Boston federal court of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and conspiracy to commit money laundering. ""Kickback arrangements pollute federal health care programs and take advantage of patient needs for financial gains,"" said Massachusetts Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell. ""Medical device manufacturers must play by the rules, and we will keep pursuing those who fail to do so, regardless of how their corruption is disguised."" Brad Bailey of Brad Bailey Law, a lawyer for Chin; Seth Orkand of Robinson & Cole, a lawyer for Humad; and Raymond Sayeg Jr of Krattenmaker O'Connor & Ingber, a lawyer for SpineFrontier did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors said the defendants entered into consulting contracts in which they agreed to pay surgeons between $250 and $1,000 per hour for consulting work. In fact, prosecutors said, surgeons did little if any consulting work, and the payments served as bribes to use SpineFrontier products. The defendants' payments through the scheme amounted to millions of dollars, they said. Government health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, were billed for the use of SpineFrontier products induced by these bribes, according to the indictment, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The charges of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, while the money laundering conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. The U.S. Department of Justice last March brought civil claims against the company over the alleged scheme, intervening in a pair of whistleblower lawsuits, which remain pending. It said at the time that five doctors had admitted to accepting kickbacks from the company and would pay $1.56 million to resolve related claims against them. In August 2020, Missouri surgeon Jason Montone and Kansas distributor John Balzer pleaded guilty to criminal charges of taking kickbacks from SpineFrontier. They are scheduled to be sentenced in March. The case is USA v. Chin et al, U.S District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 1:21-cr-10256.

Filibuster imperils Pelosi's abortion bill in U.S. Senate - Klobuchar,2136,"WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's filibuster rule likely imperils a bill intended to protect abortion rights that Democrats are readying following the Supreme Court's decision not to block a strict new Texas ban, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday. Senator Amy Klobuchar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that some Senate Republicans support abortion rights but not enough to overcome the chamber's rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. The nation's 6-3 conservative top court this week allowed Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect, which observers said showed the justices may be ready to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national right to abortion. That decision led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that the Democratic-controlled chamber will soon debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping similar state anti-abortion regulations. But Klobuchar said that bill faces little to no chance of passing the Senate. ""My solution to this ... I believe we should abolish the filibuster,"" Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Rules Committee, told CNN. ""I do not believe an archaic rule should be used to allow us to put our heads in the sand ... and not take action on these important issues ... We just will get nowhere if we keep this filibuster in place."" Progressive Democrats have repeatedly over the past year suggested doing away with the filibuster to allow other Democratic priorities to pass, including a voting rights bill intended to counteract a wave of new voting restrictions passed by Republican-governed states. Senate moderates, including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have rejected that idea, however. Klobuchar said one way to discourage the frequency of filibusters would be to make senators who object to ending debate actually stay on the floor debating. This ""talking filibuster"" was the tradition until the 1970s. She said another approach would be a ""carveout"" that would only change the filibuster for legislation directly tied to one subject, such as abortion rights.

White House asks Congress for funding on Afghanistan and hurricanes,3282,"WASHINGTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's aides on Tuesday asked Congress for billions in new funds to deal with hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan. The White House said in a blog post at least $24 billion in new money will be needed for disasters, including Hurricane Ida, and $6.4 billion will be needed for the Afghan evacuation and refugee resettlement. The request for Congress to pass a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution underscored the financial strain posed by two crises that have occupied Biden in recent days. It also set up a coming showdown with Congress over whether it will fund the full set of Biden's policy priorities or even ongoing government functions by raising what is known as the debt ceiling. About 124,000 people were evacuated last month from Kabul in a U.S.-led airlift of U.S. and other foreign citizens as well as vulnerable Afghans as the Taliban took control of the country during the chaotic American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The evacuation was one of the largest airlifts in history but thousands of at-risk Afghans and about 100 U.S. citizens have remained behind. Meanwhile, Biden was traveling in flood-damaged New Jersey on Tuesday, one of several states suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. read more The president has sought to highlight the financial toll of stronger storms whipped up by climate change. Biden's acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Shalanda Young, said in a blog post that some of the temporary funding would go to still-unmet needs from prior hurricanes and wildfires even as the government responds to Hurricane Ida. She also said most of the funds directed toward the Afghan effort would be for sites to process refugees from the country recently overtaken by the Taliban as well as public health screenings and resettlement resources. The funding measure would give lawmakers additional time to negotiate over Biden's proposals to spend trillions on new social safety net programs, infrastructure and other priorities he wants to fund with tax hikes on corporations and wealthy individuals. Biden in May proposed a $6 trillion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1, reflecting a sharp increase including measures for climate resilience. read more Lawmakers are also tangling over separate, Biden-backed legislation that would spent $1 trillion on infrastructure and $3.5 trillion on social safety net spending. Young said the short-term spending bill ""will allow movement toward bipartisan agreement on smart, full-year appropriations bills that reinvest in core priorities, meet the needs of American families, businesses and communities, and lay a strong foundation for the future."" Congressional debate is expected to heat up in the coming weeks over whether lawmakers will raise the debt ceiling, the government's ability to borrow to pay for programs it has already authorized. The Treasury is due to run out of money sometime in October. Biden's Democratic Party controls the House of Representatives and Senate by only narrow margins, with the balance of power at stake in elections next year.

BGI prenatal gene test under scrutiny for Chinese military links,9251,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Health regulators in five countries are examining a prenatal test that collects the DNA of women and fetuses for research, while some doctors that promoted it and clinics that sell it say they were unaware the company that produces it also conducts research with the Chinese military. The test, made by Shenzhen-based BGI Group and marketed under the brand name NIFTY, is sold in at least 52 countries. It screens for Down syndrome and more than 80 other genetic conditions, and has been taken by 8.4 million women globally. The regulators' concerns, raised in response to a Reuters report, highlight the challenges of regulatory oversight when genetic data is sent from one country to another. Canada's privacy commissioner said the report raised important questions about ""highly sensitive"" information and it is looking into the matter. Two regulators in Europe - in Slovenia and in Germany - said they were examining the test in light of European Union data protection rules. The data privacy regulator in Slovenia, where one of BGI's regional partners is based, said it was concerned by the exporting of data from the BGI tests and would examine data protection issues. But it added that Slovenia has not yet adopted the changes to its national laws to make Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fully applicable, so it cannot issue fines in the event of GDPR breaches. Reuters reported in July that more than a dozen scientific studies - including clinical trials - showed BGI developed and improved the test in collaboration with People's Liberation Army hospitals. BGI uses the pregnant women's genetic data for research into the traits of populations. It also collaborates with the PLA in other areas of research. BGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the NIFTY test in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent. It said it works with thousands of healthcare providers, that other prenatal test providers in China work with military hospitals, and that many companies worldwide work with militaries. It said it takes data privacy seriously, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and only 5% of its NIFTY tests have been conducted on women overseas. Consent forms signed by women outside China seek permission for their blood samples and genetic data to be sent abroad to BGI and used for research. The privacy policy on the test’s website also says data can be shared for national security purposes in China - though BGI says it has never been asked to do so. Regulators in Germany, Australia, Estonia and Canada called for transparency in BGI's use of women's genetic data, and said even if data was sent abroad, BGI's local vendors are responsible for ensuring data privacy. The European Data Protection Supervisor said it was monitoring the situation. ""It is vital that the patient is provided with clear information,"" said Beverley Rowbotham, chairperson of Australia's National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. A regulator in Ontario told Reuters it is now advising women to seek tests from providers in Canada, or places where data security is ""comparable"" to the protections mandated in Canada. The regulator in Quebec said prenatal tests - like consumer genetic tests - can result in people losing control over their genetic information. Canadian privacy and genetic disclosure laws can impose maximum fines of C$250,000 to C$1 million for breaches, and set strict conditions for exemptions for scientific research. ""Genetic information is not only valuable to marketers and data brokers, but also to foreign states and cybercriminals as well,"" the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario told Reuters. Fertility Partners, a clinic network in Canada, said it had no prior knowledge of BGI's work with the PLA, and had stopped selling NIFTY through its clinics in April for unrelated reasons. Reuters has previously reported that BGI's joint research with PLA medical institutes is wide ranging, from efforts to protect soldiers from altitude sickness to mass testing for pathogens. U.S. government advisers warned in March that a vast bank of genomic data that BGI is amassing and analyzing with artificial intelligence could give China a path to economic and military advantage. read more The same military hospital that ran clinical trials for NIFTY also collaborated with BGI to send pathogens into space under a military equipment research program, according to 12 scientific papers, which has not previously been reported. BGI did not respond to a request for more information about that research program. In the United Kingdom, where NIFTY tests are only sold through private clinics, the government said BGI would need to register its test before Sept. 1 to continue selling them. BGI told Reuters it submitted a voluntary registration to the UK medical regulator in August. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Reuters it had received BGI’s registration but said the application had not yet had data validation and scrutiny by the regulator's registration and software team. read more NIFTY tests are sold overseas through three business models: local clinics collect blood samples to send to BGI in Hong Kong; labs sequence the DNA from blood samples locally and share the data with BGI in Hong Kong where it is stored for five years; or labs complete the entire process locally using BGI technology. Labs in Spain and Slovenia each told Reuters the genetic data of a client had been used by BGI in mainland China for research, with informed consent. Slovenia-based GenePlanet, which says it sells NIFTY tests across Europe and also offers its own-branded test using BGI's technology, said the Slovenia customer gave consent for a ""research test."" GenePlanet says it operates according to EU regulations and has an agreement with BGI that ""none of the GenePlanet patient data generated from (the) NIFTY process is going to mainland China."" The Slovenian and Spanish women's data was among that of 542 women stored in China's National GeneBank, which BGI also runs. BGI said the data of the 542 women has not been used for other purposes, and its ""scientific research only uses anonymised data."" Eluthia GmbH, a laboratory in Germany which sells BGI's test, said its transfer of women's blood and patient data to BGI had been suspended by the data protection regulator for the Hesse region while it investigates whether the rules had been violated read more . Eluthia said it did not know when it could resume sending tests to BGI. Its Chief Executive Ramon Enriquez Schaefer said doctors had called the suspension ""excessive"" since patients had ""expressly consented to the shipment to Hong Kong."" He also said Eluthia hasn't been able to make ""concrete progress"" on the regulator's concerns about BGI's military collaboration. BGI told Reuters it is providing information to Eluthia and relevant government authorities to demonstrate it complies with data protection laws. DOCTORS' VIEWS One UK doctor who promoted BGI's test in an online video when it first became available said he would now advise women not to take the BGI test, due to privacy concerns. ""My personal view now would be to advise anybody not to use the BGI NIFTY test - not from a clinical point of view - but because the data from it might be misappropriated or used for reasons that neither the clinician nor the patient would ever have imagined,"" said Bryan Beattie, a fetal medicine consultant. Reuters contacted Beattie and two other UK doctors who also promoted the test on BGI's YouTube channels in 2014 for their reactions. The doctors said they were unaware of BGI's military links. BGI said the doctors were not paid to participate and it had told them the videos were for educational and marketing purposes. The NIFTY test captures more genetic information about the mother and the fetus than the results patients see, said Beattie, which has previously been reported by Reuters and BGI has confirmed. ""If you were able to link that to large numbers of patients in a foreign country, you would have a fairly good idea of their health profile over the next sort of 20 or 30 years,"" said Beattie. Beattie said he had supported the relatively new technology because it was an improvement on previous methods, but his clinic had switched to a different supplier for reasons unrelated to privacy. An Estonian scientist who turned down an offer from BGI in 2020 to replace a test developed by his lab with NIFTY said he was concerned European health services, whom he declined to name, were choosing BGI's test because of its cheaper cost and not considering data security. ""It is a stupidly easy way to earn money for taking a blood sample,"" said Kaarel Krjutskov, who runs the Estonian lab. BGI declined to sell his lab a DNA sequencer unless it also began selling NIFTY, email correspondence seen by Reuters showed. BGI's marketing material promotes its sequencing of genes as the lowest cost in the industry. BGI told Reuters it was ""always striving to make our NIFTY pricing even more affordable,"" without providing further details. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Boston Scientific on hook for $68K over sanctions in defibrillator case,3671,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp, after being sanctioned for discovery violations in a whistleblower lawsuit over allegedly defective defibrillators, has been ordered to pay the plaintiff about $68,400 in fees and expenses related to the sanctions motion. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung in Minneapolis ruled Friday that whistleblower Steven Higgins' $114,000 fee request was too high, but rebuffed Boston Scientific's bid to slash it to no more than $32,000, finding the complexity of the case justified the involvement of multiple lawyers and high hourly rates. The award comes less than a month after Boston Scientific prevailed in the case on summary judgment. It includes about $39,000 for work on the underlying sanctions motion, $27,000 on the subsequent fee dispute and $2,500 in expenses. ""We are pleased with Judge Leung’s order, and the thoughtful consideration he gave to our briefing,"" said Dan Miller of Walden Macht & Haran, a lawyer for Higgins. Rick Robinson of Reed Smith, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, declined to comment. Higgins, a doctor who served on a Boston Scientific advisory board, filed the lawsuit in 2011 under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on false claims. He alleged that Boston Scientific concealed from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the company's Cognis CRT-D and Teligen ICD defibrillator devices suffered from major defects while the agency was considering their approval. In February 2020, Leung sanctioned Boston Scientific for failing to include two ex-employees on a list provided to the whistleblower's lawyers of individuals who might have information relevant to the case. He found the omission ""harmful and prejudicial"" to Higgins and ordered the company to pay Higgins' fees in connection with the sanctions motion as a penalty. In a court filing last October, Boston Scientific said Higgins was seeking compensation for an unnecessary ""army of lawyers"" and that his proposed hourly rates - including $773.82 for senior partner Miller and $345 for a paralegal - were excessive compared to prevailing rates in the Minneapolis area market. Leung in Friday's order agreed that Higgins' request was too high. He adopted slightly lower rates, including $740 for Higgins and $250 for the paralegal, to calculate the ""lodestar"" used as the basis for the fee, which he reduced further after comparing it to similar cases. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen, granting Boston Scientific summary judgment last month, wrote that Higgins' expert witnesses failed to support his claim that the company concealed any relevant reports of adverse events linked to the devices.

"Switched at birth, Spanish woman sues health department over identity mix-up",1555,"MADRID, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A 19-year old Spanish woman whose identity was swapped at birth with another baby born hours earlier is suing the regional health department for more than 3 million euros ($3.55 million), her lawyer told a local TV station on Tuesday. The health department in the northern region of La Rioja said in a statement that an internal investigation found an undetermined ""one-off human error"" was to blame and added it would respect any judicial proceedings. ""We are not aware of any other cases,"" it said, adding that current systems in place would prevent any similar mix-up from happening again. The woman, who prefers to remain anonymous, was born in 2002 in the San Millan de Logrono hospital in La Rioja some five hours after another baby girl. ""In the case of my client, she was born later but was given to the mother who gave birth to the first child,"" Jose Saez Morga, the lawyer, told the TVR television network. ""This is negligence so gross that it speaks for itself."" He said he had filed a claim on behalf of his client against La Rioja's health department for immeasurable emotional harm caused by the error. The lawyer could not be reached for further comment. According to the larioja.com news site, the girl grew up in a dysfunctional family and was mostly raised by her grandmother. The error came to light in 2017 after her alleged father demanded a paternity test during a child support dispute, which confirmed she was unrelated to the family she grew up with.

Spain authorises booster COVID-19 shots for severely immunocompromised people,1076,"MADRID, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Spain's healthcare regulator approved on Tuesday a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines for people with severely compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the conventional two-dose inoculation schemes. The so-called booster shot should be administered 28 days after the previous one in some cases, and preferably the same type of vaccine is to be used, the Public Health Commission said in a statement. It would not say how many people could get such shots. The authority reiterated that there are no solid data available to recommend administering booster shots to the general population. The European Medicines Agency said earlier this month it was evaluating a potential booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines that may be given six months after the second one. The World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots until at least the end of September to leave more doses available for people in countries with poor access to vaccines.

Detroit hospital system sued over COVID-19 vaccine mandate,4637,"(Reuters) - Dozens of employees of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit have filed a lawsuit claiming the system's requirement that they receive COVID-19 vaccines violates their constitutional right to bodily integrity. About 50 nurses, doctors and other Henry Ford employees filed a complaint in Detroit federal court on Monday saying the mandate requires them to choose between exposing themselves to a novel and potentially harmful vaccine or abandoning their careers in healthcare. The plaintiffs, represented by VonAllmen & Associates and Renz Law, claim that as of Aug. 20, more than 13,000 people in the U.S. who received COVID-19 vaccines have died, and more than 30,000 have experienced permanent disabilities or life-threatening events. They cited statistics from unverified reports at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. In a July 21, 2021 page update, the CDC said it had received 6,207 reports of people who had died after receiving a COVID vaccine between Dec. 14, 2020 and July 19, 2021. It notes: “FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.” The CDC, on its website, says a review of available clinical information, including autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link between those deaths and COVID-19 vaccines. The lawsuit comes as an increasing number of employers are considering adopting vaccine mandates in the coming months, amid a resurgence in COVID-19 cases spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant and the Food and Drug Administration's recent full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The Henry Ford workers also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that would bar Henry Ford from implementing the mandate pending the outcome of the lawsuit. Henry Ford, in a statement provided by a spokesman, said: “We remain confident that vaccination is the most powerful tool we all have against the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond that, we cannot comment on pending litigation.” Henry Ford operates six hospitals in the Detroit area, including the 877-bed Henry Ford Hospital, and more than 40 medical centers and specialized facilities. According to the complaint, Henry Ford in June adopted a policy making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for all employees and volunteers. Under the policy, workers must be vaccinated by Sept. 10 and those who are not will be suspended and given until Oct. 1 to comply or face termination, the plaintiffs said. But the workers claim that despite the policy's stated goal of protecting employees, data suggests that receiving the vaccine could injure many of them. They also claim there is little data showing that the vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement in March: “The authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provided early, substantial real-world protection against infection for our nation’s healthcare personnel, first responders, and other frontline essential workers.” The plaintiffs said Henry Ford's mandate violates their rights to bodily integrity under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. And Henry Ford has no compelling interest justifying the mandate, they said, because the ""injections have been shown to be ineffective, cause injury, and death."" The workers say Ford is acting under color of law by asserting that its vaccine mandate serves the public function of ensuring the health and safety of its employees, patients and visitors. ""Each of these functions are traditionally, exclusively handled by the public sector,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote. ""When HFHS undertakes to determine public health policy, it becomes an actor under color of state law exposing its activity to Constitutional review."" The case is Kirn v. Henry Ford Health System, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, No. 2:21-12078.

Venezuela receives first batch of vaccines through COVAX mechanism,1688,"CARACAS, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela has received its first batch of coronavirus vaccines through the COVAX mechanism intended for poor countries, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Tuesday, after months of delays the government attributed to U.S. sanctions. The South American country has received 693,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by China's Sinovac Biotech, the first of a total of 11 million it will receive through COVAX, overseen by the GAVI alliance and the World Health Organization. Representatives of PAHO, the WHO's regional office for the Americas, and the Venezuelan government were present at Maiquetia international airport outside Caracas to receive the doses on Tuesday morning, PAHO said in a statement. Venezuela has until now depended on Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and China's Sinopharm shot to inoculate its population against COVID-19, though many people who received their first dose of Sputnik-V have reported delays in obtaining the second. An additional batch of Sputnik V doses also arrived this week, though authorities did not specify how many arrived. Some 3.3 million Venezuelans, or around 10% of the population, have been vaccinated, according to PAHO estimates. Venezuelan authorities have not provided exact figures on how many residents have been vaccinated. President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday that the vaccines were expected this week. The government for months said it had been unable to pay for the vaccines due to U.S. sanctions meant to force Maduro from power, but in April announced it had deposited most of the funds in a Swiss bank account. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Haibatullah Akhundzada: Shadowy Taliban supreme leader whose son was suicide bomber,4907,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - In one of the only known photographs of Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, he stares directly at the camera - an expressionless face between a white turban and a long, grey beard. As the Islamist movement unveiled its new government on Tuesday after it swept to power as U.S.-led forces withdrew last month, the mysterious Akhundzada retained the role of supreme leader, the ultimate authority over the group's political, religious, and military affairs he has held since 2016. ""We will rebuild our war-torn country,"" Akhundzada said in a written statement released by the Taliban after Tuesday's appointments, his first comments since the group retook Afghanistan. Akhundzada said the Taliban were committed to all international laws, treaties and commitments not in conflict with Islamic law, which would henceforth regulate all governance in Afghanistan. read more A hardline cleric whose son was a suicide bomber, Akhundzada has spent most of his leadership in the shadows, letting others take the lead in negotiations that ultimately saw the United States and their allies leave Afghanistan after 20 years of grinding counter-insurgency war. Even basic details such as his age are hard to verify. He is thought to be around 60. Yet some analysts who have studied the Taliban say he was a guiding hand, healing divisions within the movement and managing the handling over international allies and foes ahead of military victory. ""Through guile, through deception, through manipulation and through patience, he was able to bring the Taliban back to power,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. Others, however, say he is more of a figurehead, picked as a compromise candidate during a time of flux in the movement, while the real power is held by the Taliban's military factions. ""There is very little information available about him. You don't see him saying anything in person in public. And combined with the circumstances of his appointment, that feeds into the placeholder argument,"" said Rajeshwari Krishnamurthy, a South Asia security expert at the Institute Of Peace & Conflict Studies, a think tank in New Delhi. A LOT OF FORCE Born into a strict religious family in Afghanistan's second largest city Kandahar, Akhundzada was an early member of the Taliban - a movement that emerged in the surrounding southern province of Helmand from the ashes of the Afghan civil war. When the Taliban ruled between 1996-2001 with a strict interpretation of sharia law that banned women from working and imposed punishments such as stonings, Akhundzada served as the chief of its justice system, according to the United Nations. In the wake of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and ouster of the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks, Reuters exclusively reported that Akhundzada fled to Pakistan where he taught and preached at a mosque for 15 years. Colleagues and students at that mosque described Akhundzada as a studious disciplinarian and a fierce orator. ""He spoke with a lot of force about the U.S. and the war and that we would not give up our jihad,"" one former pupil said, recalling a speech he gave at a public rally in Quetta in 2014. Akhundzada was not the obvious selection when senior members of the Taliban met in 2016 to appoint a new head after the death of leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor in a U.S. drone strike. While Akhundzada hailed from the large and powerful Noorzai tribe, his stock within the regime was seen as more scholarly than soldierly, unlike previous leaders. But he was a compromise between the young and inexperienced son of late Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, and Sirajuddin Haqqani, who was wanted by the U.S. in connection with a deadly 2008 attack on a Kabul hotel, sources told Reuters at the time. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri pledged allegiance to Akhundzada in an online audio message soon after the Taliban leader took over, Reuters has reported. Unlike other Taliban leaders, Akhundzada is not on the U.N. sanctions list. However, his son Abdur Rahman died in carrying out a suicide bombing at an Afghan military base in Helmand in July 2017, according to a spokesman for the Taliban. Early in his leadership, Akhundzada instituted reforms that consolidated his influence over an insurgency weakened by division and defection. But he kept a low public profile. The only photo Reuters has been able to verify of him was an undated image posted on a Taliban Twitter feed in May 2016. It was identified separately by several Taliban officials, who declined be named. This shadowy existence has led to constant speculation about his whereabouts and health. So secretive are the Taliban about their leaders that the death of the movement's founder Mullah Omar in 2013 was only confirmed two years later by his son.

Court orders Alaska agency to examine Hilcorp pipeline leak,2265,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Alaska regulators must probe a Hilcorp Energy Company pipeline that has repeatedly leaked natural gas into Cook Inlet, the state Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The court said the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission improperly rejected a petition for a hearing on a leak that lasted for several months in 2017. The AOGCC, which regulates oil and gas production, provided “no supporting evidence” to back its claim that it lacked jurisdiction over the 2017 pipeline leak, the court said. “The Commission’s statements about having investigated whether the leak was waste are wholly unsupported,” the decision said. The petition for the hearing was submitted in 2019 by Hollis French, a former AOGCC commissioner who argued that the body had failed to fulfill its duties. “The agency seemed eager to shuck its responsibilities and the Supreme Court corrected that,” French said on Friday after the ruling. Cook Inlet, Alaska’s oldest producing oil basin, hit peak production three decades ago, averaging 219,000 barrels per day in 1971, according to the state. Oil production there is now between 11,000 and 12,000 barrels per day, according to the department. The pipeline supplies natural gas that powers operations at two of Hilcorp’s offshore oil platforms. The leak in question was discovered at the end of 2016, but it was not repaired until the spring of 2017. That pipeline has had several leaks over the years. In April, it leaked gas for the fifth time since 2014, prompting Hilcorp to temporarily shut down production at the platforms. After the most recent leak, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) ordered Hilcorp to replace the entire seven-mile pipeline section within a year. PHMSA also ordered Hilcorp to take several shorter-term correction actions in the interim. Grace Salazar, a spokeswoman for the AOGCC, said by email that the agency is reviewing the court decision to determine the next steps."
AstraZeneca boss Soriot says do not rush needlessly into COVID booster vaccines -The Telegraph,682,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said booster COVID vaccine doses may not be needed for everyone in Britain and rushing into a nationwide rollout of third doses risks piling extra pressure on the National Health Service (NHS), the Telegraph reported on Tuesday. ""We need the weight of the clinical evidence gathered from real world use before we can make an informed decision on a third dose,"" Soriot wrote in the newspaper.

BoE scraps requirement for staff to be in the office weekly from September,1683,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of England on Tuesday said it would no longer require staff to come back to the office at least once a week from September, citing health concerns among of some of its employees. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reopened England's economy, but decisions by employers over whether - and how quickly - to mandate the return of workers to offices could have a big impact on the pace of recovery from the COVID-19 slump. Britain is reporting around 40,000 new cases each day, a figure that could rise as the return of pupils to school after the summer break contributes to the spread of coronavirus. In July, the BoE's Chief Operating Officer Joanna Place said that every employee would be asked to work in the office at least one day per week from September. But the Bank of England on Tuesday said that, while there was an ""expectation"" that staff would be ""physically present in the workplace at least one day a week and generally more"" from next week, it would now no longer be mandatory. ""What has changed is that we don't feel the moment is yet right for us to require our staff to return to the office where, for a number of reasons, some might in the current environment have genuine and valid health concerns about doing so,"" the Bank of England said in a statement. ""This will be kept under close review with a view to making the expectation a requirement as the situation evolves."" The BoE said a quarter of its London staff were in the office at least one day last week, while adding that offices in some other parts of the country were at pre-pandemic occupancy levels already.

Drug companies say enough U.S. states join $26 bln opioid settlement to proceed,2511,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Three large U.S. drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) will proceed with a proposed $26 billion settlement resolving claims that they fueled the opioid epidemic after ""enough"" states joined in, the companies said on Saturday. The companies had until Saturday to decide whether enough states back the $21 billion proposed settlement with McKesson Corp (MCK.N), AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and a $5 billion agreement with J&J. The distributors said 42 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., signed on to their agreement. Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washington, West Virginia are not participating in the settlement, a person familiar with the matter said. New Hampshire agreed to settle only with the distributors, while Rhode Island joined only J&J’s deal, the person said. The companies will make their first annual settlement payment into escrow on or before Sept. 30, the distributors said. The final amount will depend on several factors, including the final participation rate of states and political subdivisions, they added. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead settlement negotiator, called the support level a ""remarkable showing of unity and commitment across the country to address this problem."" The settlement's complex formula envisioned at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies got to decide whether a ""critical mass"" had joined and whether to finalize the deal. Cities and counties within participating states have through Jan. 2 to join as well. Ultimately, $10.7 billion is tied to the extent localities participate. The deal, unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21, is designed to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction. The money would fund treatment and other services. The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with doctors, regulators and others. The deal is separate from a settlement resolving similar claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners. A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved that deal, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
FIFA opens investigation into abandoned Brazil-Argentina match,1752,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - World soccer's governing body FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings into Sunday's Brazil v Argentina World Cup qualifier which was abandoned after five minutes amid farcical scenes. Brazilian health authorities invaded the pitch to stop the game after accusing four of Argentina's English Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Tottenham Hotspur duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena field as part of Argentina's team when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa halted the match. read more ""Following the analysis of the official match reports related to the FIFA World Cup qualifier match between Brazil and Argentina, FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened involving both member associations,"" FIFA said on Tuesday. ""The two teams were asked to provide further information on the facts that led to the suspension of the match, which will be gathered and then thoroughly reviewed by FIFA’s Disciplinary Committee,"" it added. Anvisa said Brazilian rules make clear that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. It said Argentine players had made false statements about their previous whereabouts on immigration forms. Brazil's Federal Police said on Monday they had opened a formal inquiry into the actions of the Argentine players who, a spokesperson said, were deported.

"Prisoners got 15,000 gelati from pope during Rome's long, hot summer",1330,"VATICAN CITY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - They were not ""Get out of jail free"" cards but they were possibly one of the next best things. During one of Italy's hottest summers on record, Pope Francis sent 15,000 ice creams to inmates in Rome's two prisons, the Vatican said on Tuesday. A statement from the pope's charity office said they were sent to the two prisons - the older Regina Coeli jail on the Tiber River in the centre and the modern Rebibbia prison in the city's outskirts. They were delivered in his name by Polish Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, who is known as ""the pope's almoner"" or one who distributes alms to the poor. Krajewski, at 57 one of the youngest cardinals, has also set up medical and bathing facilities for the homeless near the Vatican at Francis' direction since the pontiff's election in 2013. The summer was one of the hottest on record in Italy, with one city in Sicily reporting 49 Celsius in August, believed to be the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe. Krajewski's office also sent a $600,000 computerized tomography (CT) scan machine to a health facility in Madagascar and about 2 million euros ($2.37 million) of funds to improve medical facilities in three unnamed African countries during the summer, the statement said.

UK's Sunak to set out post-COVID spending squeeze next month,3087,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Finance minister Rishi Sunak will set out next month how he will squeeze spending across much of Britain's government after announcing hefty tax rises to fund health and social care on Tuesday. Britain's budget deficit hit a peacetime high of 14% of gross domestic product in the year to March due to COVID-related spending, and since then Sunak has set out the biggest programme of tax rises since the 1970s to help narrow the gap. On Oct. 27 he will deliver a half-yearly budget statement and a three-year spending plan, for which most ministries have been told to set out cost savings, the finance ministry said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a 12 billion-pound ($16.55 billion) annual tax increase on Tuesday, using long-standing difficulties in the funding of social care to justify tax rises which will largely be spent on health services. The finance ministry said core day-to-day spending, adjusted for inflation, would rise by nearly 4% per year over the course of the current, five-year parliament, the largest real-terms increase in spending of any parliament since 2001. Sunak has overseen a surge in public spending and temporary tax cuts over the past 18 months to protect Britain's economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Sunak said his Spending Review would keep the public finances on a sustainable path and did not envisage higher spending than announced so far. BUDGET CUTS Government departments will have to identify cuts of at least 5% from day-to-day budgets in order to free up funds for reinvestment in priority areas, the finance ministry said. In March, Sunak announced big future rises in corporation tax and a freeze to income tax exemptions. Taken with Tuesday's increases to national insurance, these amount to the biggest tax rises since at least the mid-1970s, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. ""Boris Johnson has thrown low-tax conservatism out of the window, raising taxes on the working-age population to fund a big increase in NHS spending, and protect the assets of richer households from the costs of social care,"" Resolution Foundation think tank chief executive Torsten Bell said. Johnson's plan includes a cap of 86,000 pounds for people paying towards the cost of their care. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, another think tank, said the new public spending announcements would still leave overall public service spending 2-3 billion pounds lower each year than planned by the government before the pandemic. ""Given existing commitments on areas like schools, defence and overseas aid, other areas can expect their budgets to remain broadly flat over the next two years,"" IFS economist Ben Zaranko said. ""If substantial virus-related spending needs to be funded from within these totals – for instance to bail out rail operators – then some areas could even be facing cuts."" Sunak said extra spending might be required in exceptional circumstances given the uncertain outlook for the pandemic. ($1 = 0.7255 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Squeaking, hairless and pink: twin giant pandas born at Madrid Zoo",1089,"MADRID, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Twin giant panda cubs were born at Madrid's zoo on Monday in a boost to conservation efforts for the vulnerable species, whose numbers have been rebounding thanks to an international captive breeding programme.

"Theranos founder's defense may turn on state of mind, experts say",4423,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - As Elizabeth Holmes' fraud trial gets underway this week, lawyers for the former Silicon Valley entrepreneur may try to show she was a true believer in the blood-testing technology at her startup Theranos Inc, and never intended to defraud investors and patients, legal experts said. On Wednesday, federal jurors in San Jose, California will hear opening arguments in the case against the Stanford University dropout who once dazzled Silicon Valley and is now charged with misleading investors and patients by falsely claiming that the company's printer-sized devices could run a range of tests and produce accurate results using a single drop of blood. To defeat the charges, Holmes' attorneys are likely to home in on what she herself believed about the complex science, according to several defense attorneys. ""The best way to argue a defense in a science-based case is to suggest that this young woman had a good faith belief that this science was real,"" said defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman, who is not involved in the case. Holmes, 37, founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19, and prosecutors allege she told the company's private investors several lies, including that Theranos did not need U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its devices. Holmes is also accused of having defrauded patients by leading them to think blood tests from Theranos machines were more accurate than they were. The most serious charges of wire fraud require prosecutors to prove Holmes acted with intent to defraud. To be convicted, the jury of twelve must unanimously find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In court filings, Holmes' attorneys have argued there is a missing link between what Holmes herself knew and what Theranos employees told doctors and regulators about the company's technology. ""Corporate executives generally do not face individual criminal liability for the actions and statements of a corporation's agents or employees, and that principle holds equally true in this case,"" they wrote. Holmes' lawyers said last year that she was ""highly likely"" to take the stand in her own defense, a move that experts called risky. It could backfire if jurors do not view her as credible and give prosecutors latitude to bring in a broader range of evidence, they said. Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes leaves after a hearing at a federal court in San Jose, California, July 17, U.S., 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam Brafman said that distancing Holmes from testimony about patients who were adversely affected by the company's claims will be crucial if she is to be acquitted. Where there is no doubt about a fact such as an inaccurate test result, Brafman said the defense should ""take it on the chin"" and bring jurors back to questioning what Holmes knew. ""You pick battles in a trial that you have a chance of winning. The best way to confront really horrifying testimony is to not make the trial about that,"" Brafman said. JURORS' SYMPATHY Filings unsealed on the eve of trial showed that Holmes may also invoke allegations of sexual and psychological abuse by her former romantic partner, ex-Theranos executive Sunny ""Ramesh"" Balwani, as part of her defense. Holmes told a psychologist that Balwani was controlling, ""monitoring her calls, text messages, and emails; physical violence, such as throwing hard, sharp objects at her; restricting her sleep,"" according to a filing from February 2020 by Balwani's lawyers, who said the allegations required separate trials. Balwani, who has denied the allegations, is scheduled to be tried separately next year. His attorney did not respond to request for comment. Holmes' attorneys said her ""deference"" to Balwani shaped what she believed about financial models he created, and about the Theranos-Walgreens partnership he led, which prosecutors say the pair oversold to investors. Amanda Kramer, a former prosecutor in New York who has handled both securities fraud and sex trafficking cases, said that regardless of whether jurors are convinced that evidence of alleged abuse adds up to a defense, hearing such testimony ""could garner sympathy for Elizabeth Holmes, and that is not a small thing at all."" ""Because no matter their duty, that is going to influence the way they hear the evidence, and ultimately the way they deliberate and cast their votes at the end of the trial,"" she said.

Pound extends day's losses after UK announces tax hikes,3055,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The pound dipped for a second consecutive day against a broadly stronger dollar on Tuesday and hit its lowest in more than six weeks against the euro, with most of the losses coming after the British government set out a plan to raise taxes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors to try to fix the health and social care system, angering some in his governing party by breaking an election promise. read more Johnson outlined what he described as a new health and social care levy, which will see the rate of National Insurance payroll taxes paid by workers and employers rise by 1.25 percentage points. The same increase will be applied to the tax on shareholder dividends. Sterling, already trading lower on the day, dropped as much as 0.5% against the dollar to $1.3768. By 1452 GMT, it traded down 0.4% at $1.3782. It fell to its lowest against the euro since July 21, down 0.2% at 86.14 pence, and last traded 0.1% lower at 85.94 pence. ""We are seeing the narrative of the (economic) recovery process being tested by a tax hike which potentially could take liquidity or money out of the system, so that newsflow isn't particularly helpful,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC World Markets. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Michael Saunders did not have a sizeable impact on the pound. Saunders said the central bank may need to raise interest rates next year if growth continues and inflation becomes stickier. read more ""I would assume that the market sees Saunders as an outlier on the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), thus feels no need to reprice hawkishly based on what he's said,"" said Michael Brown, senior market analyst at Caxton FX. Bets that Britain's rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations would lead to a faster economic reopening and rebound had earlier propelled sterling to one of the best performing G10 currencies this year. But recent surveys have hardened indications of slowing economic growth. They also reveal that economic momentum is stuttering under the impact of Brexit, global supply chain issues and COVID-19 isolation rules. ""The pound's outlook could remain relatively bleak also as the growth-negative impact of the lingering post-Brexit uncertainty and the pandemic starts to manifest itself, while the government support for the labour market is due to expire at the end of this month,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole. ""In particular, supply-chain and labour market disruptions could fuel further increases in cost-push inflation while hurting the economic recovery."" On Monday, sterling dipped on the back of a survey of purchasing managers that showed the British construction industry grew last month at its weakest pace since the lockdown of early 2021, hit by a severe shortage of building supplies. read more Friday PMI data had showed growth in the services sector slowed in August compared with July. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
EU set to knock Japan off its safe travel list - diplomats,1660,"BRUSSELS, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The European Union is likely to remove Japan and five other countries from its list of safe travel destinations, meaning visitors or people returning from those countries could face tighter controls such as COVID-19 tests or quarantine. A special EU health committee has proposed removing Japan, along with Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brunei and Serbia, EU diplomats said on Tuesday. It has also suggested Uruguay be added. EU ambassadors, who will review the proposal on Wednesday, typically follow the committee's advice. A decision would normally be formalised by the end of the week. The list seeks to unify travel rules across the 27-nation bloc, although it does not bind individual EU nations, which are free to determine their own border policies. Germany, for example, already added Albania, Azerbaijan, Japan and Serbia on Sunday to its list of ""high-risk areas"" for which tighter entry restrictions apply. Average daily COVID-19 cases in the six countries have risen sharply from below 40 per million in late June to more than 100 in the week to Sept 6, figures from Our World in Data show, with Serbia at 500. However, the case rate in Japan has dipped in the past two weeks to almost exactly the same as in Germany. With the proposed changes the EU safe list would compromise 12 countries, including Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Chinese territories Hong Kong and Macao are also considered safe. The bloc still lets in most non-EU visitors who are fully vaccinated, although tests and periods of quarantine can apply, depending on the EU country of arrival.

Lessons from the pandemic: how to blend old with new in client service,10730,"September 7, 2021 - Change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future. — John F. Kennedy Even prior to the pandemic, client service in Big Law has become ever more starkly competitive at a local, national, and international level. For those who are seeking to seize the initiative and become change agents, the pandemic has offered an opportunity to evolve and improve the way in which lawyers foster existing relationships with colleagues and clients virtually. This article looks at the efforts that have served these authors well as cross-border colleagues over the past year and a half, the lessons learned through the process and how to benefit from integrative, sustainable change in a post-pandemic world. In order to thrive in what is, unquestionably, a new era, law firms must create a cohesive and unifying culture. Whilst this may seem axiomatic, the changes in working life and culture since we all went virtual have presented both challenge and opportunity to create this space. In some ways, the combination of a global health crisis and initiatives for social justice reform has made law firm life less hierarchical and more accepting of viewpoint diversity. We need to be intentional about these efforts as we begin to embrace a post-pandemic world. We cannot wait for normalcy to return. We are designing a new normal. Explicit steps must be taken to engage with lawyers at all levels within a firm to embrace communities of people with different backgrounds and identities to bring the best range of unique perspectives to bear on client service. While partners are often the face of business development activities, it is frequently a team endeavor, particularly in terms of support and preparatory work. Partners and other senior lawyers will find it difficult to rely on that support without empowering their fellow team members. This is especially pertinent in view of the transition to a hybrid working model. Junior lawyers will need to feel engaged, but such engagement will need to be juxtaposed with the recognition that the past 18 months have afforded a much greater degree of autonomy to the way in which junior associates work. The move away from the centralized command and control model has been swift, but those firms that correctly recognize that it is permanent will have a head start on those who clamor for a reversion to the previous era. Junior associates have worked from home effectively without direct supervision, and so, going forward, they wish to feel trusted and autonomized. Firms must also accept the inevitable truth that all employees will not be working in the office five days a week, 52 weeks a year. Inevitably, the hybrid model will triumph. However, firms must also not forget that, while people will appreciate the flexibility this affords them, it can also come at a price. It may be convenient to work from home on a personal level, but it can come with professional trade-offs. Remote life can limit mentorship opportunities for all attorneys, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This is where it is important to use technology to enable people to feel connected, such as hosting remote social events. At Dechert, we hold ""coffee roulette"" meetings, in which half a dozen people (usually two partners and four associates) are selected randomly to meet online to talk informally about life and work. As with so many aspects of COVID-19, the onscreen environment of ""Hollywood Squares"" arrived suddenly and inevitably for many lawyers. Although there are plenty who bemoan the expedited cultural and professional change, the fact that virtually everyone now has access to, and is familiar with remote conferencing platforms such as Teams, Zoom, or an equivalent, brings with it a myriad of new possibilities. Even in the 21st Century, the new video call culture has made an already small world that much smaller with its personalization and familiarity. On cross-border matters, lawyers in international hubs such as London or New York can be as effective for overseas clients as someone who is in the same location and, for those firms with a substantial international presence, establishing cohesive trans-continental teams allows those groups to address a client's need at any hour of the day. Whereas we used to benefit from the proximity of our local colleagues down the hall, now that videoconferencing is part of our daily routine, we habitually call on colleagues in London or Hong Kong in equal measure. As a result, we can draw on a much larger pool of multitudinous experience, perspective, and insight to best serve our clients (and hopefully not sacrifice too much sleep in blending the workday across time zones). One aspect of developing client relationships erstwhile overlooked is the ability to work on documents together with a client through the screen share functionality on most video call platforms. This feature provides a technical boon by offering collaboration with a ""remote"" client to draft work product on a live basis and can provide a tangible benefit in turning around a document in a shorter time. It also has the added benefit of cultivating both the personal and professional relationship, especially if there is a sense that you are ""in the trenches"" together, which is the solid foundation of all fruitful client relationships. This roll-up-your-sleeves shared working environment also lends itself to coordinated brainstorming with clients and colleagues that are physically distanced. Many of our technological enhancements, such as webcams, broadcast-quality microphones and ring lights mimic the intimacy of an actual conference room and provide opportunities for lawyers and clients to generate a better understanding of each other as people, not just business professionals. A person's home background may offer talking points to help build a professional and personal rapport, such as the view from their window or a picture of a favorite sports team on the wall. Likewise, an ""interruption"" from a child or a pet during a meeting can provide a moment of levity to the team and such occurrences have become so commonplace that embarrassment or apologies are a thing of the past. It is no exaggeration to say that for many attorneys, their preferred annual bar conference was a highlight of the professional calendar, offering the chance to meet existing and potential clients, to build their individual and firm's profile, and to stay up to speed with industry developments. The cancellation of nearly all such conferences for a prolonged period has been a source of frustration for those dissatisfied with the virtual substitutes. But for those individuals and firms willing to confront the challenge, the well of opportunity springs forth from the desert of despair. We have seen first-hand the benefits of hosting remote conferences in place of similar events which used to be held in person. Speaking engagements at virtual conferences permit the participants to engage with a wider remote audience, and the events can be recorded and disseminated more widely for later viewing of those unable to participate in real-time. When Dechert has hosted such conferences, it has given us the platform to enhance further client engagement by offering speaking opportunities to clients across the globe and to engage with their peers in the industry worldwide with the click of a button. This can help to build or cement a lawyer or a firm's reputation as a leading player in the industries in which they operate. In a similar way, the pandemic has also resulted in significantly increased content creation, such as remote workshops, seminars, and webinars, as a way of interacting with contacts. If deployed well, this can also be a great tool to interact with existing or new clients and to continue to build a platform and reputation, especially as people are now much more willing to engage with such content. However, as the adage goes, quality over quantity should be a key consideration with this type of content as its proliferation has led to a degree of saturation. Zoom fatigue is real and multitasking is an ever-present source of online disconnectedness. In this respect, the authors have found that smaller, targeted, and thoughtful focus on topics of direct interest to clients and their broadened professional roles during the pandemic can be a welcome respite from the seemingly 24/7 workday. Providing a product that delivers specific value as a timesaving mechanism is always welcome. We now have increased agency over our own workday experience, and it is an inexorable truth that how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. How will the changes of the past 18 months translate into a post-pandemic world? With sharpened focus, sustainability and staying flexible with hybrid work policies. The greater sense of freedom and flexibility to think and act with increased purpose, intentionality and practice is one we should not squander as we move forward in developing our post-pandemic habits and routines. We need to practice being present and develop good single-tasking habits amidst the cacophony of incessant matters. As challenging as 2020 and 2021 have been, with challenge comes opportunity and we now have a wealth of new approaches to enhance our professional profiles, cultures, and client service. Moving forward, a successful approach to client service and business development will inevitably involve a healthy and proportionate blend of the old with the new.

South Africa's former President Zuma placed on medical parole,1783,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 5 (Reuters) - South Africa's jailed former president Jacob Zuma has been placed on medical parole because of his ill health, the government's correctional services department said on Sunday. Last month prison authorities said Zuma, serving a 15-month sentence in Estcourt prison for contempt of court, underwent unspecified surgery at an outside hospital where he had been sent for observation. He remained in hospital with more operations planned. read more The 79-year old's eligibility for medical parole follows a medical report received by the Department of Correctional Services, it said in a statement. ""Medical parole placement for Mr Zuma means that he will complete the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections, whereby he must comply with a specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until his sentence expires,"" the department added. Its spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said that Zuma, who was imprisoned in early July, was still in hospital but could go home to continue receiving medical care. He gave no details on Zuma's illness, his parole conditions nor whether his health had deteriorated since surgery. Mzwanele Manyi, a spokesperson for the Jacob Zuma Foundation, said it welcomed the decision of the parole board and a more detailed statement would be issued after consultation with Zuma's legal team. Zuma was jailed for defying a Constitutional Court order to give evidence at an inquiry investigating high-level corruption during his nine years in office until 2018. When Zuma handed himself in on July 7, protests by his supporters escalated into riots involving looting and arson that President Cyril Ramaphosa described as an ""insurrection"".

World's top three Christian leaders in climate appeal ahead of U.N. summit,2885,"VATICAN CITY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The world's three main Christian leaders issued an unprecedented joint appeal to members of their Churches to ""listen to the cry of the earth"" and back action to stem the effects of climate change. In ""A Joint Message for the Protection of Creation,"" Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew asked Christians to pray that world leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November make courageous choices. ""We call on everyone, whatever their belief or world view, to endeavour to listen to the cry of the earth and of people who are poor, examining their behaviour and pledging meaningful sacrifices for the sake of the earth which God has given us,"" the message said. Francis heads the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, Bartholomew is the spiritual leader of the world's some 220 million Orthodox Christians and Welby is the senior bishop of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which has about 85 million members. All three have been very active in environmental affairs and concur that climate change and global warming is at least partially caused by human activities such as the use of fossil fuels. ""We stand before a harsh justice: biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and climate change are the inevitable consequences of our actions, since we have greedily consumed more of the earth’s resources than the planet can endure,"" the message said. It said recent extreme weather events, natural disasters, floods, fires, droughts and rising sea levels have shown that ""climate change is not only a future challenge, but an immediate and urgent matter of survival."" Europe had its warmest summer on record this year, though only by a small margin over two previous highest temperatures for June-August, European Union scientists said earlier on Tuesday, and green groups have called for the COP26 conference to be postponed. read more Typically delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, yet with many countries grappling with COVID-19 and poorer nations struggling to access vaccines, it should be delayed, the Climate Action Network (CAN) said. Scotland's bishops have said Pope Francis, who underwent intestinal surgery in July, will take part in the Glasgow conference, health permitting. read more A spokeswoman for Welby said he would attend. Bartholomew's office did not immediately respond to an email about his plans. On Oct. 4, the Vatican will host a major gathering of world religious leaders and scientists to take a common stand to raise the stakes ahead of the Glasgow conference. Called ""Faith and Science: Towards COP26,"" is being organised by Britain and Italy. It will bring together some 40 leaders from the world's major religions and 10 scientists.

UK employers say Johnson's tax hike will cost jobs,2337,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British business organisations criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to increase taxes to pay for health and social care reform, saying they added to the burden on firms struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would cost jobs. Johnson set out plans on Tuesday to raise taxes on workers, employers and some investors. read more The announcement received a cool reception from businesses, who were asked to pay a 1.25 percentage-point increase to a payroll tax known as National Insurance (NI). ""Businesses strongly oppose a rise in national insurance contributions as it will be a drag anchor on jobs growth at an absolutely crucial time,"" Suren  Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said. ""This rise will impact the wider economic recovery by landing significant costs on firms when they are already facing a raft of new cost pressures and dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery."" But the government said it was right that businesses should make a contribution given that they benefit from the health and social care system via their employees. Big businesses would bear the largest burden of the tax rise, Johnson said. A government document published alongside the announcement said 70% of the money raised from businesses will come from the largest 1% of companies and around 40% of businesses would not be affected at all by the levy. ""Those earning more pay more and larger businesses also contribute,"" Sunak said on Twitter. The tax increases also included a 1.25 percentage point rise in dividend tax rates which stands to affect business owners and investors who rely on dividend income. Manufacturers' group Make UK said the measures would hinder Britain's recovery from its worst economic slump in more than 300 years in 2020. ""Economic history tells us that job cuts are most likely when the economy starts to open again after a downturn because firms need the capital to reset,"" said Chief Executive Stephen Phipson. ""After witnessing large-scale redundancies at the height of the pandemic and the plug being pulled on the furlough scheme, government should be putting in place measures to protect jobs and incentivise recruitment. An increase to NI would have the opposite effect"". Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Sweden to remove most remaining pandemic restrictions this month,1809,"STOCKHOLM, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Sweden will push ahead with easing COVID-19 restrictions at the end of this month, removing most curbs and limits on public venues such as restaurants, theatres and stadiums, the government said on Tuesday. With most adults vaccinated, Sweden has gradually eased some restrictions during a summer lull in the pandemic. While it has seen infections mount in recent weeks amid the rapid spread of the more contagious Delta variant, deaths from the disease have remained low. Sweden has been an outlier in aspects of its handling of the disease, shunning hard lockdowns throughout the pandemic and relying heavily on voluntary recommendations regarding issues such as social distancing and hygiene. However, public gatherings such as concerts, sporting events and venues such as bars and restaurants have operated under tight crowd limits, curbs that are now set to be removed on Sept. 29, along with a recommendation to work from home. ""The important message is that we now take further steps in the return to normal everyday life,"" Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. ""Our view has all the time been that restrictions should be lifted as soon as possible."" Hallengren said the government was also looking into the possible use of vaccination certificates for some activities, though it hoped these would not be necessary to impose in a country with a long history of high vaccination rates. About 70% of Swedes aged 16 and above are fully vaccinated. Sweden has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, which opted for tighter curbs during the initial waves of the pandemic, but less than many larger European countries that employed hard lockdowns.

Planned Parenthood wins restraining order against Texas anti-abortion group,2170,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred an anti-abortion group from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce a near-total ban on abortion in the state, handing the nation's largest abortion provider a small victory in the bitter legal fight. Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Planned Parenthood a temporary restraining order against the anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, blocking the group and its allies from using an unusual mechanism of the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices are closer than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected. Guerra Gamble said in her three-page written order that allowing the so-called private enforcement mechanism to go forward while Planned Parenthood took further legal action would cause ""probable, irreparable and imminent injury"" that could not be cured later. The unusual enforcement mechanism gives the civil enforcement power to any party in or out of Texas who chooses to sue, while preventing government officials from enforcing the ban. The Travis County restraining order does not bar others from using the law against Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers in Texas. A hearing on a possible further injunction was set for Sept. 13. Helene Krasnoff, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president for public policy litigation and law, expressed relief ""that the Travis County district court has acted quickly to grant this restraining order against Texas Right to Life and anyone working with them as deputized enforcers of this draconian law."" ""But make no mistake: this is not enough relief for Texas,"" she said. Elizabeth Graham, a Texas Right to Life vice president, said in a statement that her group ""will never back down from protecting pregnant women and preborn children from abortion.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Factbox: How does the UK government plan to pay for health and social care?,3196,"LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday set out plans to raise taxes on workers, companies and some shareholders by 12 billion pounds ($16.5 billion) a year to try to tackle a backlog in the health system and fix how Britain's adult social care is funded. read more Below are the details of the government's plans: HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE LEVY From April 2022 the government will introduce new 1.25% levies on both earned income and on employers' wage bills to raise funds for health and social care. The levy will be based on National Insurance contributions and will be paid by working adults including - from 2023 - those over state pension age. NATIONAL INSURANCE RISE In order to bring the money in as quickly as possible, for the first year the levy will be raised via a temporary hike in National Insurance social security contributions, and then from April 2023 it will become a separate levy. The rates of National Insurance contributions will increase by 1.25 percentage points for both employers and employees until April 2023, when it will revert back to its existing level. National Insurance is not paid by people who are over pension age but still working. The government said that in 2022-23, a typical basic rate taxpayer earning the median basic-rate taxpayer's income of 24,100 pounds would pay an extra 180 pounds in National Insurance, while a typical higher-rate taxpayer earning the median higher rate taxpayer’s income of 67,100 pounds would be expected to pay an extra 715 pounds. DIVIDEND TAX RISE From April 2022 the government will also raise by 1.25 percentage points the rate of tax paid by individuals who receive dividend income from shares. Shares held in tax-exempt savings accounts known as ISAs are not subject to dividend tax. Due to a 2,000 pound tax-free allowance for dividend income, around 60% of people with dividend income outside of ISAs would not be affected, the government said. HOW MUCH MONEY WILL IT RAISE? The government said the new measures would raise around 36 billion pounds over the next three years, of which 5.4 billion pounds would be invested in adult social care. Of the 12 billion pounds on average raised per year, the government said around 11.4 billion pounds would come from the levy and around 0.6 billion pounds from the increase to dividend tax rates. The government said Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would receive an extra 2.2 billion pounds each year on average as a result of the health and social care package. HOW MUCH WILL PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TOWARDS THEIR CARE? Previously people were not eligible for help with the cost of care if they had savings worth more than 23,250 pounds. Under the new plans, from October 2023 anyone with assets under 20,000 pounds will have their care costs fully covered by the state. Those with between 20,000 and 100,000 pounds of assets will have to contribute towards the cost of their care but will also receive means-tested state support on a tapered basis. The government said no one would have to pay more than 86,000 pounds towards the cost of their care over their lifetime. ($1 = 0.7256 pounds) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Vaccine makers should supply shots for trials to help spur sector -CEPI,2646,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccine makers ought to make their approved shots available for trials or risk hobbling the development of more vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said on Tuesday. Major vaccine studies have so far examined COVID-19 infection rates comparing the prospective vaccine with a placebo. But such trials may no longer be considered ethical in countries where an effective vaccine is widely available. Instead, new vaccines would need to be tested in comparison to an established shot, said CEPI, which was launched in 2017 to fund epidemic vaccine development and is funded by countries as well as by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. read more ""Lack of access to comparator vaccines is already stalling the development of promising vaccine candidates, and the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccine development and supply is huge,"" Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI, said in a statement, a version of which waspublished as a letter to the editors of scientific journal Nature. Established vaccines have been sold under supply contracts that do not foresee use in clinical trials, according to CEPI. ""Thus far, vaccine manufacturers have been reluctant to change this arrangement, threatening to bring vital COVID-19 vaccine R&D to a standstill,"" CEPI's Saville said. An exception appears to be AstraZeneca, whose shot developed along with Oxford University has been obtained as a comparator for planned or ongoing trials, including by Italy's ReiThera Srl, Valneva (VLS.PA) of France, Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics (6547.TWO) and South Korea's SK Bioscience (302440.KS). When asked to comment on the CEPI remarks, AstraZeneca said it ""continues to collaborate with the industry and share resources to tackle the pandemic"". A Valneva spokesperson said the trial was recruited quickly and she was not aware of difficulties in procuring the AstraZeneca doses. The other main Western COVID-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE), Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) - did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CEPI's U.S. director, Nicole Lurie, told Reuters that companies selling approved vaccines are not motivated to assist trials that could lead to the development of a competing product. Countries should renegotiate contracts with manufacturers to let them use doses in trials, she said. Volumes in the tens of thousands of doses would make a huge difference for trials, small compared to the hundreds of millions being delivered, she added.

"Sergeant Bee, immortalized in Afghanistan photo, reflects on war's legacy",8938,"JACKSONVILLE, N.C., Sept 7 (Reuters) - Today, on a leafy cul-de-sac in North Carolina, his hair is streaked with gray, and he wears his beard long. But on that day 13 years ago, as he sat tucked behind a mud wall in Afghanistan, his head was close-cropped, bare and vulnerable. Retired U.S. Marine Sgt. Billy Bee is sharing a smoke with Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic on the deck of Bee's home. The smoke hangs in the humid, still air, just as it did on May 18, 2008, when their lives were stitched together in a single moment of explosive violence and unlikely survival. They are two men united by war, coming together again as the messy and tragic American involvement in Afghanistan finally was coming to an end, 20 years after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., set it all in motion. Both men remember that 2008 day as being blisteringly hot and humid. Tomasevic was in his underwear and boots, fiddling with a new lens, snapping shots of Bee near Garmsir, in Helmand province, as they talked and smoked. When shots came from a nearby hut, just beyond the wall, Tomasevic rushed into a nearby building inside the compound and grabbed some clothes, his protective vest and a helmet. He lay down next to Bee. The sergeant was a slim 26-year-old at the time, carrying an M-16 rifle that seemed almost as large as him from some angles. He wasn't wearing any body armor or a helmet but poked his head above the wall, anyway, looking for targets. Tomasevic, then 38, kept taking pictures. Moments later, a shot hit the top of the wall near Bee's head, exploding the mud and knocking him down and backward. ""And for the first time in my career, I drop the camera,"" Tomasevic says in his clipped English, spoken with a Serbian accent. ""I look at him lying down. I said, 'Bee, Bee,' and I look: Where is the blood? The bleeding? And I look around and there is nothing, man, no bleeding."" Bee was briefly unconscious but apparently fine. Later, going through the images he took, Tomasevic showed Bee the picture he caught the moment the round hit the wall. ""You are going to be famous,"" he told the Marine. And within hours, the picture had appeared on websites and newspapers around the world. For more than a decade, a framed print of the picture hung on the walls of the Reuters newsroom in New York City, an exemplar of the news agency's photojournalism. That shot, taken by a photographer whose own life was forged by war in his native land, is one of the iconic pictures of the conflict in Afghanistan, capturing the eternal fragility of service members at war. Bee loves the picture. It makes him laugh. ""I look at it with fondness. I mean, yeah, the situation was shitty at the time, the environment sucked, the whole experience was godawful. Except for, you know, the firefights and stuff like that. That's, honestly, where I think I was having the most fun of my career,"" Bee says. ""As long as we're not losing guys, I'm having a blast doing that stuff."" As it turned out, Bee wasn't fine after that picture was taken. The concussive effect of the bullet hitting so close to his head knocked him out. The image may have documented the first traumatic injury to the front of his brain, where short-term memory and reasoning are processed. There would be at least one more head injury in June 2010 that resulted in the discovery of brain damage, his medical records show. Nearly a decade after his first deployment as one of the first Marines in Afghanistan, he would never be cleared for combat again. Bee, who left the Marines in April 2013, has a frontal lobe brain injury that affects his short-term memory. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and rage disorder. But that picture thrust him into the public eye, and he and his wife, Bobbie Bee, have used it to advance the cause of care of service members damaged by war. Today, Bee is routinely quoted in news stories published worldwide and is often cited as an example of how the Veterans Administration struggled to adequately care for service members suffering from mental health problems brought on by their service. Back in 2008, on the home front, Bobbie was pregnant with their son Ethan. It was Bee's third deployment in Afghanistan but the first time he had shipped out overseas since they were married in 2006. Until that picture was published, her husband's absence half a planet away in a war-ravaged land didn't seem very different from when he went away for training. Bee never called his wife to let her know about the picture, even though Tomasevic offered to let him use his satellite phone. Shortly after the picture was published, she stumbled onto it while visiting a news site for military families. ""I let out a scream that my parents still remember, because they thought I was going into labor,"" she says. ""When I saw that picture, I am, like, this is real."" It was 78 hours before he called and she was sure her husband was alive. ""When we first talked, it was like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited you're OK. And then I was like, WHERE WAS YOUR GEAR? And he's like, what happened to the sweet wife who is so thankful I'm OK?"" In the years that followed, Bee suffered from depression and flashbacks. Two or three times a week, he woke up feeling adrenaline rushing through his body as if readying himself for a bar fight. During the day, a mild irritant for most people could turn to fury in him. He self-medicated with alcohol, he says. In October 2010, Bobbie Bee says, she came home to find him passed out in the kitchen. Earlier they had fought, and he left her a note, saying goodbye. He wanted to die. ""I tried: two liters of tequila in about two minutes,"" he recalls. ""Her and I had got into a huge fight and I say: 'I'm done. Fuck this. I have had enough.'"" Bobbie Bee says she had struggled with his angry outbursts for months since his return, but now she was scared for his life. She wanted to take him to the hospital but worried about what it would do to his career. He was too heavy for her to move far, so she propped him up against the fridge and taped his head to the door so he couldn't choke on his vomit. ""I used really strong packing tape,"" she says, chuckling with her husband as they recall the episode. ""But at the time, it was horrifying. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have family. They were 500 miles away."" Fortunately, a corpsman friend lived nearby, and he brought over saline IV drips. He inserted them into his fellow Marine's arms, and eventually, Bee regained consciousness. ""And then I wake up with my head duct-taped to the fridge and two mainline IVs in my arm,"" he recalls. With the help of his wife, Bee eventually got treatment and now takes seven prescriptions every day, including several antipsychotic and anti-depression drugs. He has a job working for a company that designs autonomous targeting robots that the Marines use for combat training. He works nights, on Camp Lejeune, the famed Marine base near his home. Sitting on the back porch, Bobbie Bee watches her husband chat with Tomasevic, who's visiting the U.S. from his home in Turkey, and says she saw, in that moment, a bit of the man she met and married rather than the man who came home from war. The two men came together to reflect on the years of warfare in response to the 2001 attacks. ""Billy can tell you everything from June 8th, 2010, and prior, as if it just happened, but if you ask him what he had for dinner yesterday, he wouldn't remember,"" she says. ""The time he spent with Goran and things like that, he remembers. So that's what makes him happy."" And while sitting next to Tomasevic, he laughs and reminisces about the weeks they spent together, sleeping on cardboard, and numerous firefights with the Taliban. Bee's memory of those days is precise and detailed. ""I cannot believe I have come to his house,"" Tomasevic says. ""I feel really good, but I still can't believe I'm here talking to him. We can't stop talking."" Tomasevic spent about three weeks with Bee's unit in 2008. They came together again in 2010 in Marjah, Afghanistan, shortly before the last injury that ended the Marine's combat career. Tomasevic has continued working in conflict zones for Reuters, from the Arab Spring in Egypt to the fighting in Syria, Libya and, of course, Afghanistan. He insists he is more than the work he has done shooting conflict and despair. ""I am a professional. I shoot sports, whatever."" But he acknowledges that he takes special pride in his war work. ""I have an affection for war and conflict because I believe this is the hardest to do in this job."" Thirty years after joining Reuters during the civil war in his native country, then Yugoslavia, he says he can compartmentalize the images, so they don't damage him in the way others might be damaged. ""I grew up in a war zone. And I have been doing this for 30 years."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Indonesia records its lowest rate of positive coronavirus tests,2164,"JAKARTA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia's daily coronavirus positivity rate dropped below the World Health Organization's (WHO) benchmark standard of 5% this week for the first time, an indicator the country's devastating second wave could be easing. The positivity rate, or the proportion of people tested who are positive, peaked at 33.4% in July when Indonesia became Asia's coronavirus epicentre, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. On Monday that rate fell to 4.57%, the lowest since March 2020, when Indonesia's first cases were reported, according to independent data initiative, Kawal COVID-19. A rate above 5% indicates coronvirus is out of control, the WHO says. Kawal co-founder Elina Ciptadi said the trend was a good sign, although she cautioned that official data could not capture a dearth of underreported cases and deaths. ""All in all, what we are seeing is encouraging,"" she said. Since its July peak, the average positivity rate has fallen steadily, from 23.8% in the first week of August to 11.3% in the final week of that month, to 6.2% on average so far in September Coronavirus restrictions were eased further on Monday, with most areas on Java island downgraded, allowing conditional operation of malls, factories and restaurants. But President Joko Widodo urged Indonesians not to be complacent. ""People need to realise that COVID is always lurking,"" he said. ""When our guards are down, (cases) can increase again."" Epidemiologist Dicky Budiman from Australia's Griffith University said testing and tracing efforts remain weak. ""I'm both happy and worried about the decline,"" he said. ""There were efforts from the government, but not strong enough to get us out of the crisis period,"" he said, adding improvements were mostly in big cities. Weekly health ministry data last week shows several provinces still recording high positivity rates, with Aceh at 17.4% and North Kalimantan at 16.7%. COVID-19 task force spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito said the government would keep improving its testing and tracing capability. ""We're hoping this good condition can be upheld,"" he added.

"Reopen schools or disaster looms, experts tell Indian authorities",3401,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Many top Indian epidemiolgists and social scientists are urging authorities to reopen in-person school classes for all age groups, saying the benefits outweigh the risks especially as poor rural children are missing out on online education. The recommendation comes as experts say another COVID-19 wave in India this year could be far less deadly, because a dramatic rise in cases in April and May means a big majority of the population have been infected already, while more than half of its adults have been at least partly vaccinated. India last month approved its first COVID-19 shot for people under 18, though as of now only adults are being immunised. As new infections have stabilised around 40,000 a day in the past few weeks, some Indian states have restarted face-to-face teaching, mainly for middle school and above. Experts say that is not enough. ""Schools are an essential service. It has been wisely said that they should be the last to close and the first to reopen,"" said a report released on Monday on school education by a group of scholars, including economist and social scientist Jean Dreze, that warned of a ""looming disaster"". ""In India, the opposite has been happening: soon after the COVID-19 crisis struck in early 2020, all schools were closed without batting an eyelid and most of them are still closed today."" The health and education ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The federal government has largely left it to states to decide when to reopen schools. NO EDUCATION An August survey of nearly 1,400 school children done by the scholars' group found that in rural areas, only 8% were studying online regularly, 37% were not studying at all, and about half were unable to read more than a few words. Most parents wanted schools to reopen as soon as possible, it said. The reasons were that many children did not have their own smartphone, mobile connectivity was poor, they did not have the money to pay for mobile Internet, schools were not sending study material or online education was too hard to grasp for some. The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, whose roughly 6,000 members are doctors who have studied epidemiology, told the government in a report it was safe to resume all offline classes after taking precautions such as improved ventilation, physical distancing and masking. Epidemiologists also say that as India's last serological survey estimated that more than half of the country's population of 6-17 years had already been infected, without any particular severity, there was no reason to worry that a future wave will specifically target the unvaccinated ones among them. ""The risk of moderate to severe disease in children is really low and vaccination is not a prerequisite,"" said epidemiologist and public health expert Chandrakant Lahariya. ""Therefore, I believe that the technical experts should not rush to recommend vaccination of adolescents in India. The focus has to continue to be on achieving high coverage for all adult age groups,"" he said in an email. India has administered 701.9 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. India reported 31,222 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 33.1 million. Daily deaths rose by 290 to 441,042. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

UN says basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing,1054,"GENEVA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Afghanistan is facing the collapse of basic services and food and other aid is about to run out, the U.N.

OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that millions of Afghans were in need of food aid and health assistance, urging donors to give more ahead of an international aid conference for Afghanistan on Sept. 13. The agency has released a flash appeal for around $600 million to meet humanitarian needs for 11 million people for the remainder of the year amid warnings of drought and starvation. ""Basic services in Afghanistan are collapsing and food and other lifesaving aid is about to run out,"" he said. ""We urge international donors to support this appeal fast and generously.""

"Nigeria's Delta region oil hub may need new COVID lockdown, governor says",1775,"YENAGOA, Nigeria, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The governor of Rivers State in Nigeria's oil-producing Delta region said he may be forced to reimpose COVID-19 lockdown measures if residents did not comply with prevention protocols amid a rise in cases. Governor Nyesom Wike implored residents to get vaccinated and comply with safety and social distancing rules amid a consistent rise in COVID-19 infections over the past two weeks. ""We may be constrained to re-impose the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the state if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits,"" Wike said in an address on Monday. Wike shared a copy of the speech with Reuters on Tuesday. Rivers state capital Port Harcourt is the gateway to the Delta region. Movement restrictions last year impinged on oil companies' ability to move workers around the region and forced some to delay or curtail maintenance. The state's 10,809 confirmed COVID-19 cases make it the third worst-hit state in Africa's most populous country, after Lagos and the federal capital territory of Abuja. On August 26, the state recorded 263 cases - the highest daily count since March 2020. The state has also recorded a total of 137 deaths. Wike also appealed to religious leaders and churches to encourage their members to get vaccinated and comply with the COVID-19 protocols. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, is battling a third wave of COVID-19 infections. The country began its vaccination campaign in March with nearly 4 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca shots provided via the COVAX scheme, and has since received millions more doses of AstraZeneca and Moderna shots. However it has also struggled with vaccine hesitancy. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Week ahead in Insurance: Sept. 7, 2021",3252,"(Reuters) - Here are some events of interest to the Insurance Law community this week. All times are local unless otherwise noted. Thursday, Sept. 9 10 a.m. – In arguments to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Allstate Insurance will defend a ruling by a federal judge in Brooklyn that allows it to seize and sell the home Mark Mirvis and his spouse transferred to their daughter in 2015, days after he was found jointly liable under RICO for using New York’s no-fault auto insurance laws to defraud health insurers of $46 million. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen last year voided the 2015 transfer, restoring the property to Mark and Lyubov Mirvis as a tenancy-by-the-entirety with right of survivorship; then, she found that Lyubov Mirvis had acted in bad faith, and extinguished her right of survivorship. Lyubov Mirvis argues that the lower court erred in its findings and that, in any event, the court could not extinguish a spouse’s right of survivorship under New York law. Chen noted that New York’s highest court had not weighed in that question and that lower state and federal courts had gone both ways. The 2nd Circuit stayed Chen’s ruling pending this appeal, Allstate Insurance Co. et al. v. Mirvis, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 20-1385. For Allstate: Daniel Marvin of Morrison Mahoney.

G7 nations urge return to constitutional order in Tunisia,2045,"TUNIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The ambassadors of the G7 group of advanced economies urged Tunisia's president on Monday to appoint a new head of government as a matter of urgency and return to a constitutional order in which an elected parliament plays a significant role. The statement, put out by the British Embassy on social media, is the most significant public expression of unease by major democracies since President Kais Saied seized governing powers in July in moves his opponents called a coup. ""We underline the urgent need to appoint a new head of government to form a capable government able to address the immediate economic and health crises facing Tunisia,"" the statement said. Saied did not directly comment on the G7 statement. But in remarks later on Monday to the National Guard, he said: ""Tunisia is a sovereign country and sovereignty belongs to the people"". Western democracies have been among the most important donors helping to support Tunisian public finances over the past decade as the economy has slumped since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy. Saied, who was elected in 2019, said on July 25 he was freezing parliament, lifting the immunity of its members, dismissing the prime minister and that he would assume executive authority alongside a new premier. He said his intervention was in line with the constitution and necessitated by a national emergency due to political paralysis, high COVID-19 rates, and protests. He has vowed that rights will not be affected. Six weeks on, however, he has not named a prime minister or said what he plans to do, has indefinitely rolled over the emergency measures and said there can be ""no going back"", while Tunisians speculate about whether he will amend the constitution. The G7 statement said appointing a prime minister would ""create space for an inclusive dialogue about proposed constitutional and electoral reforms"" and added that democratic values would remain central to their relations with Tunisia.

"Mixing CanSinoBIO, Sinovac COVID shots induces stronger response than Sinovac alone -study",1808,"BEIJING, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A Chinese study looking at mixing COVID-19 vaccines showed that receiving a booster shot of CanSino Biologics' vaccine after one or two doses of Sinovac Biotech's (SVA.O) vaccine yielded a much stronger antibody response than using the Sinovac shot as a booster. The study, among the first analyses in China combing different COVID-19 vaccines, comes as the country said it would use booster shots in specific groups amid concerns over vaccines' waning protection over time. Participants who received a CanSinoBIO (6185.HK), booster dose three to six months after a second Sinovac shot showed a 78-fold jump on average in neutralizing antibody levels two weeks later, according to a paper published on Monday before a peer review. By contrast, those who received a Sinovac booster shot showed a 15.2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, researchers from local disease control authorities, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutions said in the paper. One dose of Sinovac followed by a CanSinoBIO booster at intervals of one or two months led to a 25.7-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels, while two doses of Sinovac induced a 6.2-fold increase. The study analysed data from about 300 healthy adults aged 18-59. The study did not assess the boosters' protection against COVID-19 and did not test the neutralising antibody against the more transmissible Delta variant, the paper said. More than 1.4 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been administered globally, about three quarters of them in China. China, which has kept local infections under control, has fully vaccinated around 69% of its population as of Sept. 6. It said on Tuesday a total of 2.1 billion doses had been administered as of Monday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

India 'prepares for the worst' ahead of possible COVID-19 third wave,4690,"NEW DELHI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases and deaths exploded in India in April and May, New Delhi's premier Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and several others ran so short of oxygen that many patients in the capital suffocated. When Reuters visited the hospital on Friday, its last coronavirus patient was readying to leave after recovery - a remarkable turnaround health experts attribute to growing levels of immunity from natural infection and vaccinations. But hospitals have learned from bitter experience during the second COVID wave, when funeral pyres burned non-stop and bodies littered the banks of the holy Ganges river, as India braces for another possible surge in infections around its September-November festival season. Beds have been added at facilities around the country, and hospitals are working to ensure ample supplies of oxygen. Ganga Ram is raising its oxygen storage capacity by 50%, has laid a one-kilometre-long pipeline carrying the gas directly to COVID ICUs, and is installing equipment to keep the oxygen flow high. It has also ordered an onsite oxygen-generation plant, which are mostly made in Europe and can take months to arrive given the surge in demand globally. ""In light of the possibility of the emergence of coronavirus mutants, with higher transmissibility and immune escape, the hospital continues to prepare for the worst,"" said Satendra Katoch, medical director of the hospital, in between guiding colleagues doing an internal audit of its facilities. The crowded private hospital, however, said it had no scope to add more beds. During the peak of India's second wave, Ganga Ram expanded its capacity by nearly 50% to about 600 beds, but even so, some 500 patients per day had to be put on a waitlist for admission, according to physician Varun Prakash, who managed its war-room during the crisis. Nationally, India has added many more hospital beds in the past few months and imported more than 100 oxygen carriers to raise the total to about 1,250. Companies such as Linde (LIND.NS)(LIN.N) are planning to lift the country's overall output of the gas by 50% to 15,000 tonnes a day. Linde told Reuters it had retained 60 of some 80 cryogenic containers - meant to hold super-cooled oxygen - it had brought in from the company's overseas operations, in case demand shot up again. ""The distribution infrastructure and logistics fell short during the second wave,"" Linde South Asia head, Moloy Banerjee, said. The federal government, meanwhile, has approved the construction of nearly 1,600 oxygen-generation plants at hospitals, though fewer than 300 had been set up as of early last month as imports take time. HIGH ANTIBODY LEVELS Almost all states are readying special paediatric wards as some experts warn unvaccinated children could be vulnerable to any new virus mutations. States including Madhya Pradesh are also stocking up on anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir. But with a government survey estimating as many as two-thirds of Indians already have COVID-fighting antibodies through natural infection, and 57% of its adults with at least an initial vaccine dose, many health experts believe any new outbreak of infections could be much less devastating than the second wave. ""The number of susceptible persons will be less now, as many persons have been infected or vaccinated,"" said epidemiologist and cardiologist K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Even if reinfections or breakthrough infections occur, they are likely to be mild and mostly managed at home. The serious gaps in health-service delivery that were evident in the second wave are less likely to be seen."" Kerala is seeing such signs already. The southern state currently has the highest number of infections, including many among vaccinated or partly vaccinated residents, but its fatality rate is well below the national figure. At 33.1 million, India has reported the most number of COVID-19 cases after the United States, with 441,042 deaths. It has administered 698.4 million vaccine doses - at least one dose in 57% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 17%. The health ministry, which wants to immunise India's entire adult population this year, did not respond to a request for comment on its preparations for a potential third wave. Epidemiologist and public health specialist Chandrakant Lahariya said the data and trends were encouraging. ""With the emerging evidence that for individuals with past infection, single dose may provide far greater levels of antibodies than people who did not have infection or receive both shots of vaccines, it is assuring for India.""

Japan picks three COVID-19 drug candidates to get research funds,429,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Japan has selected three candidates for COVID-19 treatments to receive subsidies for clinical trials, the health ministry said on Tuesday.

Indian court backs shorter dose gap for those paying for AstraZeneca vaccine,1961,"KOCHI, India, Sept 7 (Reuters) - An Indian court has ordered the government to offer a choice of a shorter four-week gap between doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine to those paying for the shots, down from 12 to 16 weeks now. India doubled the gap between doses of the locally-produced Covishield vaccine in May, to help stretch scarce supplies, so as to give at least one dose to 57% of its 944 million adults. But just 17% have been fully immunised. In an order posted on its website on Monday, the high court in the southern state of Kerala ordered changes in the health ministry's vaccine-booking platform to permit the choice, in line with that offered to those flying abroad. ""There is absolutely no reason why the same privilege shall not be extended to others who want early protection in connection with their employment, education, etc,"" the court said. In its remarks, the court drew a parallel with the government's permission for those planning overseas travel to choose between early and better protection from COVID-19 infections. The decision followed a plea by two garment companies with a total of more than 10,000 employees. The court asked the government to enable scheduling of the second dose within four weeks of the first for those who want it, in line with the gap specified in initial vaccine protocols. The health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The ministry has said its decision for a wider gap between doses was based on scientific evidence that the step boosted protection. India's immunisation campaign began in mid-January, with a four-week interval between two Covishield doses. India has injected 698.4 million doses of vaccine. About a quarter of the supplies are sold, with the rest provided free. India's tally of infections stands at 33.1 million, boosted by 31,222 new cases in the past 24 hours, with daily deaths up 290 for a total of 441,042.

FIFA chief says Brazil game abandonment was 'crazy',3563,"MANCHESTER, England, Sept 6 (Reuters) - FIFA is investigating the abandonment of the Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier with its president Gianni Infantino labelling the events ""crazy"", while Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly ready to take disciplinary action against their Argentine players. read more Brazilian health authorities intervened on Sunday after accusing four Argentine Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Spurs duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of Argentina's team when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa walked onto the field and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. read more Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia had also travelled from the UK and was in the stands. Anvisa said Brazilian rules make clear that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. It said Argentine players had made false statements about their previous whereabouts on immigration forms. Brazil's Federal Police said on Monday they had opened a formal inquiry into the actions of the Argentine players who, a spokesperson said, were deported. ""We can confirm an investigation has begun into the possible crime of supplying false information,"" a spokesperson said. ""Yesterday, the players were notified they must leave the country, which is the regular procedure, and statements from them were taken."" The Argentina squad left Brazil together on Sunday night and flew back to Buenos Aires. FIFA said it had received reports from match officials. ""The information will be analysed by the competent disciplinary bodies and a decision will be taken in due course,"" world soccer's governing body said in a statement. The Argentine Football Association said FIFA gave both national associations six days to outline their positions. DIFFICULT SITUATION Infantino, in a video address to the European Club Association's general assembly, said the situation was a reminder of the difficulties faced during the pandemic. ""We saw what happened with the game between Brazil and Argentina, two of South America's most glorious teams,"" Infantino said. ""Some officials, police, security officials entered the pitch after a few minutes of the game to take away some players - it is crazy but we need to deal with these challenges, these issues which come on top of the COVID crisis."" Alejandro Martinez, brother of Emiliano, said the players were due to fly from Argentina to Croatia, which is a UK green-list country, later on Monday to avoid the 10-day mandatory hotel quarantine on return to the UK from a red-list country. ""They will travel to Croatia to do their quarantine there and then go to England,"" Alejandro told radio station La Oral Deportiva. ""That was the condition set by Aston Villa."" The Argentine Football Association (AFA) said Martinez and Buendia had been released from the national team, meaning they will not take part in Thursday's qualifier at home to Bolivia. The AFA later released Spurs pair Lo Celso and Romero, saying, “they are out of the game against Bolivia and can return to their club”. The website football.london said the Spurs pair could expect club fines on their return to England having made the trip without the permission of their club. Villa and Tottenham declined to comment.

"Taliban claim control of Panjshir, opposition says resistance will continue",5536,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed victory on Monday in the last part of Afghanistan still holding out against their rule, declaring that the capture of the Panjshir valley completed their takeover of the country and they would unveil a new government soon. Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the gate of the Panjshir provincial governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), commanded by Panjshiri leader Ahmad Massoud. ""Panjshir, which was the last hideout of the escapee enemy, is captured,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference. Massoud did not concede defeat, saying his force, drawn from the remnants of the regular Afghan army as well as local militia fighters, was still fighting. ""We are in Panjshir and our Resistance will continue,"" he said on Twitter. He also said he was safe, but gave no details on his whereabouts. The steep valley north of Kabul was long famed for holding out against attack, including both by Soviet troops in the 1980s and the Taliban during their previous rule in the 1990s. It was the main redoubt of the Northern Alliance resistance fighters who toppled the Taliban with U.S. air support in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The Taliban assured the people of the valley - who are ethnically distinct from the mainly Pashtun Taliban - that there would be no ""discriminatory act against them"". ""They are our brothers and would work together for a joint purpose and welfare of the country,"" Mujahid said. CURTAINS IN CLASSES The Taliban have repeatedly sought to reassure Afghans and foreign countries that they will not reimpose the brutal rule of their last period in power, when they carried out violent public punishments and barred women and girls from public life. But more than three weeks after they swept into Kabul, they have yet to announce a government or give details about the social restrictions they will now enforce. Asked whether the United States would recognise the Taliban, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House late Monday: “That’s a long way off."" Teachers and students at universities in Afghanistan's largest cities - Kabul, Kandahar and Herat - told Reuters that female students were being segregated in class with curtains, taught separately or restricted to certain parts of the campus. A view of a gate of the provincial governor's office in Panjshir, in this picture uploaded to social media on September 6, 2021. Social media handout/via REUTERS One female student said women sat apart from males in university classes before the Taliban took over, but classrooms were not physically divided. ""Putting up curtains is not acceptable,"" Anjila, the 21-year-old student at Kabul University, told Reuters by telephone. ""I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago."" HUMANITARIAN AID Inside Afghanistan, hundreds of medical facilities are at risk of closure because the Western donors are barred from dealing with the Taliban, a World Health Organization official said. The WHO is trying fill the gap by providing supplies, equipment and financing to 500 health centres, and was liaising with Qatar for medical deliveries, the UN health agency's regional emergency director, Rick Brennan, told Reuters. U.S.-led foreign forces evacuated about 124,000 foreigners and at-risk Afghans in the weeks before the last U.S. troops left Kabul, but tens of thousands who fear Taliban retribution were left behind. About 1,000 people, including Americans, have been stuck in northern Afghanistan for days awaiting clearance for charter flights to leave, an organiser told Reuters, blaming the delay on the U.S. State Department. Reuters could not independently verify the details of the account. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said the agency had registered 300 children who had been separated from their families during the chaotic evacuations from Kabul airport. ""Some of these children were evacuated on flights to Germany, Qatar and other countries ... We expect this number to rise through ongoing identification efforts,"" she said in a statement. Inside Afghanistan, drought and war have forced about 5.5 million people to flee their homes, including more than 550,000 newly displaced in 2021, according to the International Organization for Migration. Western powers say they are prepared to send humanitarian aid, but broader economic engagement would depend on the make-up of the Islamists' new government in Kabul. China's ambassador to Afghanistan promised to provide humanitarian aid during a meeting with senior Taliban official Mawlawi Abdul Salam Hanifi in Kabul on Monday, Tolo news reported. China has not officially recognised the Taliban as Afghanistan's new rulers, but Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month hosted Mullah Baradar, chief of the group's political office, and has said the world should guide the new government rather than pressure it. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin meanwhile met Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, as Washington seeks to build a consensus among allies on how to respond to Taliban rule. Blinken also spoke on Monday with Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah, and thanked him for Kuwait's assistance with evacuations, the State Department said.

Japan to purchase 150 mln doses of Takeda-produced Novavax vaccines - drugmaker,1987,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T) said on Tuesday the Japanese government agreed to purchase 150 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it will produce using Novavax Inc's (NVAX.O) formula. Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker, is preparing to make the vaccine domestically and will distribute it in early 2022, pending approval from regulators, the company said in a statement. The TAK-019 vaccine is still undergoing clinical trials in Japan, according to Takeda. The terms of the deal with the government are confidential, Takeda said. Novavax is licensing and transferring manufacturing technologies to enable Takeda to manufacture the vaccine, according to the statement. The announcement builds on an earlier agreement between Takeda and the government to make some 250 million doses of the Novavax shot. The remaining doses could be given to other countries, Takeda has said previously. read more Japan has donated most of its domestically produced supplies of AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine, relying primarily on imported doses of the mRNA-type shots developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) for its national inoculation push. After a slow start, Japan's vaccination drive has made some progress in recent months, with 58% of the population now having received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Takeda is also handling the import and distribution of some 50 million doses of Moderna's vaccine this year and 50 million more next year. Three batches of Moderna supplies, or about 1.6 million doses, were recalled in Japan after the discovery of small metal contaminants in some vials. read more The health ministry said on Monday that a third person had died after getting a shot from the recalled Moderna supplies.

U.S. Justice Dept. says will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attack,1926,"WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law that imposed a near-total ban on abortion. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a 1994 law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act). The FACE Act prohibits the use of force and physical obstruction to interfere with a person obtaining or providing reproductive health services. Former President Bill Clinton backed the legislation in response to violence by anti-abortion activists in the 1980s and 90s. ""The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack,"" Garland said, adding that he would ""not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services."" Garland said the Justice Department would enforce the FACE Act while it ""urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons."" Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices arecloser than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected.

"France mourns 'national treasure' Belmondo, New Wave cinema star",2992,"PARIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Jean-Paul Belmondo, a star of France's New Wave cinema after his breakthrough performance in Jean-Luc Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (""Breathless"") in 1959, has died. He was 88. The death of a leading figure in French cinema was felt across the country. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that France had lost a ""national treasure"". ""It seems to me that all of France is sad,"" Michel Godest, Belmondo's friend and lawyer, told BFM TV, breaking down in tears. A charismatic actor who often performed his own stunts, Belmondo switched in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's leading comedy and action heroes. His decision to pursue a career in commercial cinema and to shun the art houses led to criticism that he had wasted his undisputed talent - something he always denied. ""When an actor is successful, people turn their back on him and say that he has taken the easy way out, that he doesn't want to make an effort or take any risks,"" Belmondo once said. ""But if it was so easy to fill cinemas, then the film world would be in much better health than it is. I don't think I would have stayed in the limelight for so long if I was doing any old rubbish. People aren't that stupid."" Godest told AFP that Belmondo passed away at home, adding: ""He had been very tired for some time. He died peacefully."" 'HOOLIGAN'S FACE' Belmondo was born on April 9, 1933, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the son of the renowned sculptor Paul Belmondo and painter Sarah Rainaud-Richard. Despite his cultured background, he appeared more drawn to the world of sport than the arts and was a keen boxer in his youth. Once he had discovered acting, it took three attempts before the Paris Conservatory agreed in 1952 to take him on as a student. Even then it was not a smooth passage, and Belmondo quit in a huff in 1956 after receiving a cool reception for one of his performances from a conservatory jury. One of his teachers predicted at the time: ""Mr. Belmondo will never succeed with his hooligan's face."" Belmondo's reply was an obscene gesture. He went on to star in more than 80 movies, many of them blockbusters, over the next half a century. Belmondo first gained acclaim in ""Sois belle et tais-toi"" (""Look pretty and shut up"") in 1958 and in ""A double tour"" by Claude Chabrol in 1959, where his magnetism stole the film. But his role as a small-time hood who romanced American ingenue Jean Seberg in Godard's ""Breathless"" earned him international stardom. Belmondo's appeal, a mixture of cynicism and sensitivity, warmth and unselfconscious ease, created a new kind of romanticism that brought him roles in the films of France's New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Alain Resnais and Louis Malle. ""If I have advice to give young actors, it is to never neglect technique: without technique, you limit invention. But it should never show. What counts is the result, not the sweat and the pain it cost,"" he once said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"G20 urges COVID help for poor states, but short on new commitments",2631,"ROME, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The group of 20 rich countries said on Monday more efforts were needed to help poor countries vaccinate their populations against COVID-19, but steered clear of making new numerical or financial commitments. Italy, which holds the G20 presidency this year, said after the gathering that the ""Pact of Rome,"" where the meeting was held on Sunday and Monday, included a political agreement to increase support for poor nations and send them more vaccines. ""The level of (vaccine) inequality is too high and is not sustainable,"" Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters. ""If we leave part of the world without vaccines we risk new variants which will hurt all of us...Our message is very clear: no one must be left behind in the vaccination campaign."" Vaccines are being shipped to poor countries through the international COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). However, richer nations have come under fire for allegedly stockpiling COVID-19 jabs as many underdeveloped countries with low inoculation rates and rising infections struggle to get supplies. read more ""The strongest countries...are committed to investing significant resources and sending vaccines to the most fragile...We should strengthen this system bilaterally and through international platforms starting from COVAX,"" Speranza said. However, asked whether the G20 had made any new concrete financial commitments, he warned such pledges risked being a ""straitjacket,"" and the important thing was a ""political goal"" of global vaccination. ""We want to take the vaccine to the whole world and we'll make the investments necessary. Will they be enough? Will more be needed? The countries of the world are making a commitment in this direction,"" he said. A 11-page declaration released after the meeting made no new financial pledges, but Speranza said these may be delivered at a joint meeting of G20 health and finance ministers in October. That will be ""a decisive occasion to find the resources to finance the instruments we have put on the table"", he said. A little over 230 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to 139 countries under COVAX, GAVI data shows, against a target to secure 2 billion doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. Speranza stressed that poor countries must also be helped to produce vaccines at home. ""Transferring doses is not enough. We have to make other areas of the world capable of producing, sharing methodologies and procedures,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Chilean health regulator approves CoronaVac use among children over age 6,1409,"SANTIAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Chilean health regulator on Monday approved the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) for use in children over 6 years of age, allowing more people to be included in the country's rapid inoculation campaign. The South American country has already approved the use of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) vaccine for children over 12, with 654,053 receiving at least one dose since May. Sinovac's CoronaVac has formed the backbone, however, of Chile's vaccination campaign, which has seen more than 13 million of the country's 19 million inhabitants fully inoculated so far and 19.49 million CoronaVac doses issued in total. ""This is great news for school-age children and those that were not included in previous vaccination plans,"" said Health Minister Enrique Paris. Five of the experts on the evaluation panel convened by the Institute of Public Health (ISP) voted in favor of applying the shot to children over 6, while two voted in favor of issuing it only to those over 12, and one voted against issuing it to children. CoronaVac also has emergency approval for use in children in Indonesia and China. Chile has seen in recent weeks a noticeable drop in infections, recording just 435 new cases on Monday. It has had a total of 1.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 37,108 deaths. ​ Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK announces extra 5.4 bln pounds to help COVID-hit health services,2230,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Britain will set aside a further 5.4 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) over the next six months to help its National Health Service cover additional costs from the COVID-19 pandemic and to tackle the huge treatment backlog. Record-breaking waiting lists for routine hospital treatment and an unprecedented summer demand for emergency services are heaping pressure on the health service in England. ""The NHS was there for us during the pandemic - but treating COVID patients has created huge backlogs,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. ""This funding will go straight to the frontline, to provide more patients with the treatments they need but aren’t getting quickly enough."" The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, warned last week that the health service will need about 10 billion pounds more a year to reduce the COVID-19 backlog and cover additional costs from the pandemic. The extra funding announced by the government includes 1 billion pounds to help tackle the backlog and 2.8 billion pounds to cover related costs such as enhanced infection control measures to keep staff and patients safe from the virus. The total number of people who have been referred for hospital care rose in June to 5.45 million, the highest monthly figure since records began, NHS England figures show. Britain's health secretary Sajid Javid last month said that an estimated 7 million people who might have needed to use the health service during the pandemic did not access it – and the waiting list will climb further as more of them seek care. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases have started to climb again over the past month, raising the possibility there could soon be an increase in hospital admissions. The ambulance service handled more than 1 million 999 calls in July, the highest monthly figure on record. More than 2,200 accident and emergency patients waited more than 12 hours on trolleys to be admitted to a ward, the figures showed. The government said the extra funding would take total COVID-19 support for the health service to more than 34 billion pounds this year alone.

Hundreds of health centres at risk of closure in Afghanistan - WHO,1675,"GENEVA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Hundreds of medical facilities in Afghanistan are at risk of imminent closure because the Western donors who finance them are barred from dealing with the new Taliban government, a World Health Organization official said on Monday. Around 90% of 2,300 health facilities across the country might have to close as soon as this week, the UN health agency's regional emergency director, Rick Brennan, told Reuters in an interview. He said may Western donors had regulations which prevented them from dealing with the Taliban, without going into further detail. ""We are going to have a pause in operations in a large proportion of those (health facilities). By some estimates up to 90% will cease functioning probably later in the week and that will be associated with increased illness and death,"" Brennan said. The WHO was trying fill the gap by providing supplies, equipment and financing to 500 of the health centres, he said. The agency was also liaising with Qatar for medical deliveries to come by plane, he added. read more ""We are hoping to have up to two or three plane-loads of supplies airlifted from the government of Qatar probably into Kabul in the next week or so,"" he said. The next deliveries would include COVID tests and supplies to treat chronic diseases. Along with other aid agencies, the WHO has struggled to bring in medical supplies including trauma kits partly because of chaos at Kabul airport. read more Medical supplies continue to be flown in via the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and the WHO is also exploring overland options via trucks from Pakistan, Brennan said.

8th Circ finds no evidence of Medicaid fraud by Planned Parenthood,3627,"(Reuters) - A former clinic director failed to offer evidence that Planned Parenthood of the Heartland intentionally miscoded abortion-related services to get Medicaid to pay for them between 2006 and 2008, a federal appeals court held. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a win Friday for the Iowa-based nonprofit, represented by Dentons, on the remnants of a False Claims Act lawsuit that the Alliance Defending Freedom and Hixson & Brown had filed in 2011 on behalf of Susan Thayer. On the miscoding claim, Thayer accused Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (PPH) of coding post-abortion followup visits as generic post-surgical consultations, then adding the code to bills for contraceptive counseling or other services that Medicaid does cover. The consultation did not increase the charges on two of the six sample bills Thayer submitted as evidence of PPH's practice, but had resulted in a one-level upgrade, good for an extra $12, on each of the other four. “We assume without deciding that she is right, and that Planned Parenthood falsely billed (Medicaid) for these services,” Circuit Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote. However, that alone would not support Thayer’s claim that the falsehood was intentional, he said. Like the lower court, “we think a one-level difference in billing, resulting in less than a $12.00 reimbursement difference, is at most evidence of an innocent mistake or negligence, not a willful lie to cheat the government,” Kobes wrote. He was joined by Circuit Judges Steven Colloton and Roger Wollman. PPH’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. PPH merged with several other Planned Parenthood organizations in 2018 to create Planned Parenthood North Central States. Thayer’s attorneys did not respond directly, but the Alliance Defending Freedom emailed a statement saying that ADF and its client are considering their options. According to Thayer’s 2011 complaint in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, she had worked for PPH between 1991 and 2008 and had managed two of its centers. Thayer alleged that the organization overbilled Medicaid in many different ways between 2002 and 2008, resulting in an estimated $28 million in extra charges. U.S. District Judge John Jarvey granted PPH’s motion to dismiss the case in 2013, finding that Thayer had not plausibly alleged fraud. Thayer appealed, and the 8th Circuit revived some of her claims in 2014. Jarvey further narrowed the suit on remand. By 2019, just two counts remained on Thayer’s Third Amended Complaint: the abortion-related coding claims, and an allegation that PPH had distributed oral contraceptives to women without a prescription. Both sides moved for summary judgment. On the upcoding claim, Jarvey found that Thayer’s evidence would support, at most, an inference of non-actionable coding or billing errors. The 8th Circuit agreed on Friday. On the contraceptive claims, Jarvey ruled for PPH after finding that Thayer had insufficiently pleaded her case. She sought judgment on the basis that PPH had billed Medicaid for extra cycles of pills it dispensed to clients whose prescriptions had expired, but her complaint was focused on bills for contraceptives dispensed before the client ever obtained a prescription, he said. The 8th Circuit affirmed that ruling as well on Friday. The case is Susan Thayer v. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-2151.

Vietnam's capital ramps up testing after extending COVID-19 curbs,2337,"HANOI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, extended COVID-19 restrictions on Monday for a further two weeks, as authorities launched a plan to conduct tests on the city's 8 million people to try to curb a climb in infections that started in late April. The Southeast Asian country dealt successfully with the virus for much of the pandemic, but the virulent Delta variant has proved more challenging in recent months. COVID-19 has infected more than 536,000 people in Vietnam and killed 13,385, the vast majority in the past few months. Hanoi, which has ordered people to stay home and halted all non-essential activities since July, has divided the city into ""red"", ""orange"" and ""green"" zones based on infection risk. ""People in quarantine camps, isolated areas or in red areas will be tested three times per week,"" city authorities said in a statement late on Monday, adding that people in other zones would be tested every five to seven days by either a PCR or rapid antigen test. Barricades on Monday separated red zones from other areas, photographs posted on social media and media outlets showed. Hanoi has been reporting 50 cases daily on average and has recorded over 4,100 cases since the pandemic began, official data showed. Hanoi authoritiesare eager to keep the outbreak from reaching the intensity seen in Ho Chi Minh City, which accounts for nearly half of the total infections and 80% of fatalities. In the southern business hub,where a strict lockdown is in place until Sept. 15, people have been encouraged to test themselves using antigen COVID-19 kits after health services were overwhelmed. In a rare live broadcast of questions from the public to an official late on Monday, Phan Van Mai, chairman of Ho Chi Minh City, said some restaurants in safe zones would be allowed to reopen for takeaway and that city authorities would look to gradually reopen the economy. One-third of Hanoi's residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine and the Health Ministry on Sunday called on the capital and Ho Chi Minh City to vaccinate all adult residents with at least one dose by Sept. 15. read more Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.4% of its 98 million people fully vaccinated, and 19% with one shot.

Argentina's Martinez still nonplussed over abandoned World Cup qualifier,3254,"BUENOS AIRES, Sept 6 (Reuters) - One of the players at the centre of Sunday's cancelled Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier has recalled the farcical scenes in Sao Paulo and what he said was despair at the thought of being obliged to stay in Brazil for 14 days of quarantine. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was one of four English Premier League players in the Argentina squad for the game away to arch-rivals Brazil. The match was suspended minutes after kick off when officials from Brazil’s health regulator came onto the pitch to stop the England-based players from playing because, according to the body, they had not completed the required 14-day quarantine on arrival in Sao Paulo. read more Martinez told reporters none of the Argentina players sheltering in the dressing room knew what was going on as officials at the side of the pitch discussed whether or not the match could continue. “We spent half an hour waiting to see if we could restart but after 40 minutes they told us we had to leave,” he said in Buenos Aires. “Then there was this despair, if I’d have to stay with the England lads for 14 days. It was all so uncertain. “We didn’t understand what was going on,” he added. Martinez plus Tottenham Hotspur defender Cristian Romero and midfielder Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentina lineup, while Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia was in the stands. “Obviously there had been rumours that the Premier League players wouldn’t play in the game but they would have told us when we arrived in Brazil and so we didn’t make any big show about cancelling the match,” said Martinez. “It was simple, we were going to win and we felt good.” PAIR RELEASED The Argentina squad were allowed to fly to Buenos Aires on Sunday night and Martinez and fellow Villa player midfielder Emiliano Buendia were released on Monday morning and permitted to rejoin their club. “Villa did not understand why it happened, but everyone saw it,” Martinez said before flying out. “It was supposed to be a great game for us to enjoy, not a spectacle.” The farcical scenes were an embarrassment for South American football and came at the end of a turbulent week. Some European sides had stopped their players travelling to South America because they would have to quarantine on return and potentially miss important club matches. Brazil were without nine key players, and other nations, Paraguay and Uruguay among them, also had some players missing. But Martinez, who established himself as first choice during Argentina’s triumphant Copa America campaign in June and July, said there was no way he would have given up playing for his country. “The four from England decided to go because we love the shirt,” he said. “No matter how much the Premier League (players) didn’t want to come, we decided we were going anyway. Because after the Copa America, everyone wanted to be there. ""It’s something beautiful and we must live with the consequences. On a personal level I needed to play these games.” Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina.

Analysis: Turkey and UAE rein in dispute that fuelled conflict and hurt economy,5128,"ANKARA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A truce between bitter regional rivals Turkey and the United Arab Emirates has calmed tensions that fuelled conflicts including Libya's war, officials and diplomats say, after years of animosity and insults. But with political differences still running deep, the two countries are expected to focus on building economic ties and de-escalating, rather than resolving, an ideological rift that has drawn a faultline through the Middle East. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the UAE's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, spoke by phone last week following contacts between intelligence and government officials. Erdogan, who a year ago said Turkey could cut diplomatic relations with Abu Dhabi after it set up ties with Israel, also discussed UAE investment in Turkey with Abu Dhabi's national security adviser. ""The UAE is interested in exploring prospects of reinforcing ties,"" an Emirati official said, pointing to trade and investment opportunities in transportation, health and energy. The talks follow earlier efforts by Turkey to ease tensions with UAE allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt, with a delegation from Cairo due in Ankara on Tuesday. Those contacts have so far yielded little, but some see the UAE track moving more swiftly. ""It's going very fast,"" said a diplomat in the Gulf. ""Faster than many people thought it would. They have turned the page."" A senior Turkish official described Erdogan's call last week with Sheikh Mohammed as a significant move towards overcoming disputes which have plagued their relations, saying the two countries could work together in the Middle East. ""But first there will be steps taken in terms of the economy,"" the official said. Other issues ""are not agreed, but a desire was formed (to tackle) the large part of these problems."" COST OF RIVALRY The rift stems from the Arab uprisings, when Turkey backed the Muslim Brotherhood and their Islamist allies challenging entrenched autocrats from Tunisia to Syria - alarming the UAE's dynastic rulers, who see the Brotherhood as a political and security threat. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a Gulf dispute, putting it at odds with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while Turkish support last year helped Libya's U.N.-backed government drive back UAE-supported forces trying to seize the capital. The two countries have traded accusations of interference beyond their borders, and Erdogan once chided the UAE's foreign minister as an impudent nouveau riche when he retweeted comments critical of Ottoman forces - forebears of modern Turkey. In Somalia, Turkey and the UAE have competed for influence. In Syria, Turkey still supports fighters opposed to President Bashar al-Assad while the UAE, which once backed rebels fighting him, has opened an embassy in Damascus. Turkish officials and Gulf diplomats say both countries recognise their geopolitical tensions came at an economic price, heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. That cost was felt particularly by Erdogan in Turkey, where stubbornly high 19% inflation has driven up the cost of living and where state banks sold $128 billion in foreign reserves last year in an attempt to support the tumbling lira. ""The cost of strained ties is not sustainable in the region when it comes to Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia,"" a second Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The departure of U.S. President Donald Trump removed a leader who emboldened their rival regional interventions. Although no agreement has been announced on investments, the two countries already have an economic platform to build on. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which maintains an unofficial boycott of Turkish exports, the UAE says it remains Turkey's largest regional trading partner. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth funds have also made significant recent investments in Turkey's online grocer Getir and e-commerce platform Trendyol. Political differences will be harder to overcome, with Egypt and its Gulf allies insistent that Ankara pull out troops and Turkey-backed Syrian fighters from Libya, a demand which diplomats say is a priority for Cairo and its allies. Nevertheless, a decade on from the ""Arab Spring"" the revolutions are mostly over and the Muslim Brotherhood has been weakened - easing two of Abu Dhabi's main sources of friction with Erdogan, who strongly backed Brotherhood figures. ""For Saudi Arabia and the UAE this is not the priority file that it used to be,"" said Galip Dalay, a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. In a gesture to Cairo earlier this year, which would also have been noted in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, Turkey asked Egyptian opposition channels including Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist-leaning broadcasters, to tone down criticism of Egypt. Turkey still blocks access to the websites of some UAE organisations, including the state news agency, but the government has halted what was once a regular barrage of criticism directed at the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. ""There is a desire on both sides to de-escalate, and see what happens,"" Dalay said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Russian aluminium giant says could recall personnel from Guinea if crisis worsens,2257,"MOSCOW, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal (RUAL.MM), said on Monday it aimed to keep its three major bauxite mines and one alumina refinery in Guinea operating after the military coup there, but could evacuate all Russian personnel if the crisis worsened. Moscow has a long history of relations with Conakry that goes back to trade and economic cooperation during the Soviet era, and is currently focused mainly on the metals business. The coup in the West African nation with the world's largest bauxite reserves, used to produce aluminium, sent prices of the metal to a 10-year high on Monday. There was no immediate indication of any supply disruptions. read more Rusal, the world's third largest aluminium producer, is a big presence in Guinea's key bauxite industry with its mines accounting for 42% of Rusal's total bauxite capacity.

""In case of further escalation, the company is considering options for the evacuation of Russian personnel from the republic,"" it added. Russia-focused producer Nordgold operates the Lefa gold mine in Guinea, which accounted for 17% of Nordgold's total production in 2020. ""Nordgold remains unaffected by the current political situation in Guinea and our mine site continue to operate as normal... We are monitoring the situation closely,"" Nordgold said in a statement.

UK PM's planned tax hike for social care triggers fury within ruling party,4682,"LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to hike taxes to fund social care has provoked fury among many of his own lawmakers, who fear that such a clear violation of his election promises shows he is happy to oversee a sweeping expansion of the state. After the fiscal splurge on the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson is now addressing Britain's creaking social care system, whose costs will soar as the population ages, while facing numerous other thorny policy matters. Johnson wants to raise the National Insurance (NI) tax paid by working people to subsidise care for pensioners, including wealthy retirees, according to British media. But many lawmakers from Johnson's own Conservative Party worry this will hurt younger, low-income workers and breach his 2019 election guarantee not to raise the rate of NI - which still adorns the Conservatives' website. ""The proposal will be aimed at supporting the more affluent, but the tax will be paid by lower income earners. That's unfair,"" one Conservative lawmaker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. ""We shouldn't break solemn election promises unless there are hugely good reasons to do so."" Like many other Western leaders, Johnson is facing demands to spend more on welfare after government borrowing ballooned to 14.2% of economic output - a level last seen at the end of World War Two. The row over his planned tax hike comes after charges that Britain was unprepared for the chaotic fall of Afghanistan, while the country is also facing labour shortages and supply chain problems exacerbated by Brexit, as well as a high COVID-19 death toll. Johnson is due to address parliament on the Afghanistan situation later on Monday, and the BBC said he would shortly announce a new 5.5 billion pound ($7.6 billion) package for the National Health Service. Details of the NI hike are likely to come later, possibly on Tuesday. 'TAX-AND-SPEND' For years, British leaders have been trying to find a way to pay for social care without endangering support by hiking taxes. Johnson said he had a plan for social care in 2019. British ministers are still thrashing out the details but Johnson had been expected to announce a roughly 1 percentage point increase on the rate of NI paid by workers and their employers, which official estimates show would raise around 10 billion pounds a year. ""With regards to our plans for social care, we are committed to setting out long-term sustainable reform of the sector and that is what we will do,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters on Monday. The finance ministry declined to comment. While Johnson's huge majority of 80 in parliament means a defeat may be unlikely, members of his own cabinet have hinted at their opposition to tax hikes. House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg on Sunday invoked former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who came to regret saying ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" during the 1988 election campaign. ""(Voters) remembered those words after President Bush had forgotten them,"" Rees-Mogg wrote in a Sunday Express opinion piece. Many of Johnson's lawmakers fear raising taxes will alienate many of the voters in northern England who supported him in the 2019 election, when he promised explicitly not to raise income tax, Value-Added Tax or National Insurance. BIGGEST EVER BENEFIT CUT Johnson also promised in 2019 to maintain the ""triple lock"", which annually links the state pension to whichever is highest out of inflation, earnings or a 2.5% increase. Owing to a statistical quirk during the pandemic, the official measure of earnings is running at almost 9% - which would result in a bumper payout to pensioners just as the government has stressed the need to tighten belts. ""Given that average wage levels have been skewed by the unprecedented events of the past 18 months, the (finance minister) should temporarily suspend the wages element of the lock,"" said Mel Stride, who heads parliament's Treasury Committee of lawmakers. Johnson faces more widespread resistance to plans to remove a 20 pounds-per-week increase to state benefits, known as Universal Credit, that was introduced at the height of the pandemic. The move would affect 4.4 million households from mid-October. ""If the (government) goes ahead with this cut, it would be the largest overnight benefit reduction that has ever happened,"" researchers Torsten Bell, Adam Corlett and Daniel Tomlinson said in a report published by the Resolution Foundation think tank on Monday.

India plans 50% increase in oxygen production before third COVID-19 wave,2115,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - India aims to ramp up its medical oxygen production capacity to 15,000 tonnes per day before a potential third wave of coronavirus infections that is expected to hit the country as soon as mid-September, an industry executive said. The target implies a 50% jump from the maximum output of almost 10,000 tonnes reached earlier this year during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave, when hospitals ran short of the gas and relatives of patients had to search out oxygen cylinders. Linde India (LIND.NS) supplied nearly one-third of the total oxygen demand during the peak. Moloy Banerjee, head of Linde South Asia, said that while the government is targeting 15,000 tonnes of medical oxygen per day, Linde and other manufacturers were hoping to hit production of at least 13,500 tonnes per day ahead of the third wave. As of Monday, India's total COVID-19 cases had reached 33.03 million, with the death toll at 440,752, according to health ministry data. While demand for medical oxygen in India has considerably reduced since the peak, reaching near pre-COVID levels, gas companies along with the government are gearing up for a scenario where the third wave could be worse than the previous one. The New Delhi government said last month it will increase oxygen production by setting up new manufacturing units or expanding the production capacity of existing units for uninterrupted oxygen supply during a health crisis. Shares of Linde India rose to record levels in the days following the Delhi government's notification and have more than doubled for the year as of Monday's closing price. ""There have been discussions with the Delhi government since the second wave of COVID-19. We are still reviewing the policy and trying to see if it is workable for Linde,"" Banerjee added. The company has not entered any formal agreement with the government. Linde has also been in touch with the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states to support setting up of additional oxygen storage capacities and manufacturing units.

Moloy Banerjee, head of Linde South Asia, said that while the government is targeting 15,000 tonnes of medical oxygen per day, Linde and other manufacturers were hoping to hit production of at least 13,500 tonnes per day ahead of the third wave. As of Monday, India's total COVID-19 cases had reached 33.03 million, with the death toll at 440,752, according to health ministry data. While demand for medical oxygen in India has considerably reduced since the peak, reaching near pre-COVID levels, gas companies along with the government are gearing up for a scenario where the third wave could be worse than the previous one. The New Delhi government said last month it will increase oxygen production by setting up new manufacturing units or expanding the production capacity of existing units for uninterrupted oxygen supply during a health crisis. Shares of Linde India rose to record levels in the days following the Delhi government's notification and have more than doubled for the year as of Monday's closing price. ""There have been discussions with the Delhi government since the second wave of COVID-19. We are still reviewing the policy and trying to see if it is workable for Linde,"" Banerjee added. The company has not entered any formal agreement with the government. Linde has also been in touch with the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states to support setting up of additional oxygen storage capacities and manufacturing units.

JD.com says founder Liu to step away from day-to-day operations,2910,"SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China's JD.com (9618.HK) said on Monday founder and chief executive Richard Liu will switch his focus to the e-commerce giant's long-term strategy, creating the new role of president to run the company's day-to-day operations. The move comes as several other founders of China's tech companies have gradually relinquished the top job, such as at Alibaba and ByteDance, although Liu, 48, will retain his title as chief executive and his board seat. The new role of president will be filled by Xu Lei, currently CEO of JD's biggest division, who has taken on a more prominent public role at the company in recent years. Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, will also spend more time mentoring younger management and contributing to the revitalisation of rural areas, JD said in a statement. ""Looking to the future, the correct long-term strategic design, the growth and development of young talents, and the healthy and coordinated development of various business units will continue to be the driving force for JD, in doing the hardest and most challenging, but right and most valuable things for the industry,"" Liu said in the statement. Liu owns nearly 80% of JD's voting power, according to its 2020 annual report, and some investors have previously raised concerns his tight control, coupled with the lack of an obvious successor, had posed a management risk. His control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2017 following a rape allegation, which he denied. Liu was not charged but the incident caused a storm on Chinese social media. Citi analysts said Xu's promotion reflected the way he had proven his leadership and management skills in spearheading JD Retail's operations and he was a potential successor to Liu. ""We believe if Mr. Xu further proves his management capability, we would not be surprised if he is positioned as a potential successor to Mr. Richard Liu should Mr. Liu decide to step down one day,"" they said in a Monday note. Xin Lijun, who previously headed up JD Health (6618.HK), will take over from Xu as JD Retail's chief while Jin Enlin will become JD Health's new CEO. Following Xu's promotion, Liu will retain his board seat and position as CEO of JD.com, a company spokesperson confirmed. In 2019, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) co-founder Jack Ma formally stepped down as chairman of the e-commerce giant, handing over reigns to Daniel Zhang. In 2021, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced he would step down from his role as CEO, while Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) founder stepped down as chairman following an earlier resignation of his CEO title. Chinese authorities have also launched a wave of new industry regulations and penalties since late 2020, many of which have targeted the internet sector in particular.

McIlroy lends support to Osaka over decision to take break,1589,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Golfer Rory McIlroy has backed Naomi Osaka's decision to take a break from tennis following the Japanese world number three's elimination from the U.S. Open last week, saying that it was important that athletes did not let results define them. A tearful Osaka told reporters that she would be taking some time off from the sport after crashing out in the third round at Flushing Meadows to 19-year-old Leylah Fernandez, adding that she had been struggling with anxiety and depression over the last few years. Speaking after his final round at the Tour Championship -- where he finished tied for 14th -- McIlroy said that he had faced similar difficulties in his own career. ""I spoke about this in 2019 about separating who I am as a golfer and who I am as a person and trying to not let that define me, and it seems what Naomi is going through at the minute is that same thing,"" said the four-time major winner. ""How can I play tennis and enjoy it and not let the results define who I am... I think everyone just needs to let her have time to figure that out."" Osaka has received support from various athletes, including tennis greats Billie Jean King and Boris Becker, as well former American sprinter Michael Johnson, with many praising her for bringing to the fore a new discussion around mental health. read more McIlroy added: ""She seems like a really smart girl, and hopefully she'll be able to do it and come back and start enjoying the game just like when she picked the racket up when she was a little girl.""

"Taliban tells Berlin it will welcome German companies, aid",2461,"BERLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Taliban would welcome German investment in Afghanistan and help in areas including humanitarian aid, health care, education and infrastructure, the group's spokesman told Bild newspaper. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month as foreign forces pulled out after a 20-year mission, and the country is facing an economic collapse and humanitarian crisis while donors and governments weigh up how to deal with the new leaders. Germany, acting in concert with the European Union, has laid out conditions to resume a diplomatic presence in Kabul and unfreeze development aid, urging the Taliban to respect human rights, particularly those of women. read more ""The German government could encourage its entrepreneurs to come and invest in our country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an interview with Bild published on Monday. The Taliban would pave the way for investments and ensure companies' security, he said. Germany maintained close relations with Afghanistan in the past and after the fall of the first Taliban government in 2001 hosted a conference in Bonn that was supposed to lay the foundation for a democratic Afghanistan. The hardline Islamist group has sought to present a more moderate face this time. read more ""We would like to revive the friendly atmosphere that existed between Afghans and Germans. The next government will be based on a friendly relationship with Germany,"" Mujahid said. ""We would like Germany to support us in the humanitarian sector, and we need help in the health care sector, in the area of education and with the infrastructure,"" he added He also said the Taliban would be ""very happy"" to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel - who is about to step down as Germany's leader - for a visit in Afghanistan. German citizens living in the country and Afghans who have cooperated with Germany in the past should not be afraid of the Taliban and there would be no problems, Mujahid said. Those among them who wanted to leave the country will have to take the legal route, he added. The German military evacuated more than 5,000 people from Kabul airport at the end of August, but thousands of former local staff and their families are still in the country. Berlin has promised to get them out. Germany's designated ambassador to Kabul, Markus Potzel, has been negotiating with the Taliban in Doha to gain safe passage for them.

India's Hetero gets emergency use nod to make Roche's COVID-19 drug,1166,"BENGALURU, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Indian drug developer Hetero said on Monday it has received emergency use approval from the country's health authorities to make a generic version of Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) COVID-19 drug. Hetero expects to make the treatment, tocilizumab, available in India by the end of the month under the brand name Tocira. Tocilizumab has been facing a global shortage as the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant drives up cases in several countries. COVID-19 cases in India have declined from levels hit during the second wave in April and May, although health experts believe that the country should brace for a third wave by October. Roche's blockbuster arthritis drug, tocilizumab, cuts the risk of death among patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 along with shortening the recovery time and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation. read more Tocira will be made by Hetero's unit at its Hyderabad facility.

Brazil v Argentina suspended after health officials intervene over quarantine breach,4886,"SAO PAULO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A World Cup qualifier between Argentina and Brazil was suspended amid farcical scenes on Sunday after Brazilian health authorities accused a number of Premier League players of violating the country's COVID-19 quarantine rules. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Tottenham duo Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were on the Neo Quimica Arena pitch as part of the Argentine line-up when officials from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa invaded the pitch and stopped the game around five minutes after kickoff. The trio, along with Aston Villa’s Emiliano Buendia, who was in the stands, had reportedly breached Brazilian rules stating that travellers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country, unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency. The regulations were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 583,000 Brazilians. While the visitingteam quickly left the field, the two coaches, along with Argentina captain Lionel Messi and the Brazilian players, gathered at the side of the pitch to discuss the stoppage. ""Why did they start the game and stop it after five minutes?"" Messi said in comments heard on television. ""We've been here at the stadium for an hour, they could have told us."" Messi then returned to the dressing room and at 5pm local time, an hour after the game kicked off, the match was officially suspended. “The referee and the match official will take a report to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and they will decide what steps to take,” said a statement issued by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Anvisa said they had issued ample warnings that the four Argentines were in contravention of Brazilian health regulations. Argentine officials were told on Saturday the four should isolate and when the instructions were ignored, Anvisa asked Brazilian federal police to enforce the isolation ruling on Sunday morning, the regulator said. Their attempts were ""frustrated,"" Anvisa said in a statement issued late on Sunday. Brazilian Football Confederation president said he was “indignant” with the scenes that reverberated around the football world. Ednaldo Rodrigues criticised Anvisa and said officials told him the Argentines who breached the country's COVID-19 rules could have been deported after the game. Soccer Football - World Cup - South American Qualifiers - Brazil v Argentina - Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo, Brazil - September 5, 2021 Players and officials are seen on the pitch as play is interrupted after Brazilian health officials objected to the participation of three Argentine players they say broke quarantine rules REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli “I feel sorry for all the sports fans who wanted to watch the game on television,” he told Brazil’s Sportv. “With all due respect to Anvisa, they could have resolved this earlier and not waited for the game to start.” A shellshocked Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni agreed. “It makes me so sad, I am not looking for guilty parties, whatever happened or didn’t happen, this wasn’t the time to do it,” he told Argentine broadcaster TyC Sports. “We wanted to enjoy a game between the best in the world and it ends up like this.” “As a coach I am going to defend my players. If people come and say we want to take this guy or deport this guy there was no chance of that,"" he said. ""Because at no time were we told we couldn't play the game."" Argentine officials believed the same protocols used in the Copa America in Brazil in June were in place for the World Cup qualifiers to allow teams to travel across the continent. CONMEBOL confirmed that interpretation. FALSE DETAILS In a statement Anvisa said it had received reports that the four Argentine players had provided “false information” on their pre-flight health declarations. ""Anvisa considers the situation a serious health risk and so has asked local health authorities to determine the immediate quarantine of the players, who are stopped from participating in any activity and should be prevented from remaining on Brazilian soil,"" Anvisa said in a statement. The confusion comes amid continuing anger in South America at rules which have robbed several teams of key players for this month’s three World Cup qualifiers. Brazil were without nine key men for Argentina game, and other South American sides have also lost players due to a decision by some European clubs not to let their players travel to the continent. They would have had to quarantine when they returned to Europe and the clubs do not want to lose their players for subsequent league games. Brazil lead the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022, six points ahead of second-placed Argentina. The top four qualify automatically for Qatar.

"Florida gunman kills 4 including baby, wounds 11-year-old girl",2303,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - A self-described survivalist in body armor shot and killed four people, including a woman and her 3-month-old baby boy in her arms, before surrendering to police in central Florida on Sunday, officials said. The shooter, identified as Bryan Riley, 33, a former U.S. Marine, also wounded an 11-year-old girl who underwent surgery for seven gunshot injuries, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told a news conference. Riley, who had no connection to the victims, engaged in a shootout with police before giving up, and later tried to grab a police officer's gun while being treated in the hospital for his own gunshot wound, before being subdued again, Judd said. A veteran of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Riley was working as a bodyguard and a security guard. His girlfriend of four years told investigators he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and occasional depression, Judd said. About a week ago his mental health worsened and he told his girlfriend he had started speaking with God, Judd said. ""He said at one point to our detectives, 'They begged for their lives and I killed them anyway',"" Judd said at a second news conference. Riley also told sheriff's deputies he was high on methamphetamine, Judd said. The shooter first appeared randomly at the house where the shooting occurred on Saturday night, making nonsensical statements, but left by the time police responded. He returned early Sunday morning, killing a 40-year-old man, the 33-year-old mother and her baby boy, Judd said. In the home next door, he also killed the 62-year-old mother of the woman, Judd said. ""In addition to that, if he's not evil enough, he shot and killed the family dog,"" Judd said. Deputies responding to reports of two volleys of automatic gunfire arrived to find the suspect unarmed outside, wearing camouflage and body armor. Riley then went back inside and ""we heard another volley, and a woman scream, and a baby whimper,"" Judd said. A gunfight ensued before he came out unarmed and was arrested.

Each COVID-19 surge poses a risk for healthcare workers: PTSD,5513,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - Nurse Chris Prott's knees jump, his heart races, his mouth goes dry and his mind floods with dark memories when he talks about working in the Milwaukee VA Medical Center's intensive care unit (ICU) during pandemic surges. Prott shares a struggle common to many of the military veterans for whom he has cared for years: symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prott was among a half dozen ICU staffers who told Reuters of symptoms such as waking from nightmares bathed in sweat; flashbacks to dying patients during the pandemic's fear-filled early days; flaring anger; and panic at the sound of medical alarms. Those whose symptoms last longer than one month and are severe enough to interfere with daily life can be diagnosed with PTSD. The surging Delta variant is heaping on fresh trauma as the United States and other nations begin to study PTSD in health workers. Data already showed that U.S. health workers were in crisis before COVID-19. While PTSD is associated with combat, it can arise among civilians after natural disasters, abuse or other trauma. Health workers can be reluctant to equate their experience with that of returning soldiers. ""I feel like a schmuck calling it PTSD,"" Prott said. ""It took me a long time to be able to talk to somebody because I see guys with real PTSD. What I've got going on, it's nothing in comparison, so you feel guilty for thinking that."" Psychiatrist Dr. Bessel van der Kolk knows better. ""On the surface, a nurse at your local hospital will not look like a guy coming back from Afghanistan,"" said the author of ""The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma."" ""But underneath it all, we have these core neurobiology-determined functions that are the same."" Pre-pandemic studies showed that rates of PTSD in front-line health workers varied from 10% to 50%. The suicide rate among doctors was more than twice that of the general public. The American Medical Association (AMA) has tapped a military psychologist and the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Center for PTSD to help it measure the pandemic's impact. Texas Tech University Health Science Center psychiatry resident Dr. Huseyin Bayazit and researchers in his native Turkey surveyed 1,833 Turkish health workers last autumn. The results, presented in May at an American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed a PTSD rate of 49.5% among nonphysicians and 36% for doctors. Rates of suicidal thoughts increased as workers spent more time on COVID-19 units. Unions want to mitigate trauma by setting national rules for the number of patients under each nurse’s care. Workers say they should not have to pay for therapy, medication, and other interventions. Nurse Chris Prott examines a patient in the urgent care department at the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, U.S., August 25, 2021. John Jamison/Handout via REUTERS The AMA and other groups want more confidentiality for doctors who seek mental health services. Most ICU staff who discussed PTSD with Reuters requested anonymity for fear of repercussions at work. New York's Mount Sinai Health System and Chicago's Rush University System for Health provide free, confidential mental health services. Mount Sinai's new Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth offers a military-inspired ""Battle Buddies"" peer-support program for nurses. A chaplain from Rush's ""Road Home"" program for veterans runs a ""post-traumatic growth"" bereavement support group for ICU nurses. The VA system provides no-cost, short-term mental health counseling through its employee assistance program. Many local VA facilities supplement those with spiritual counseling and crisis incident response teams, a spokesperson said. 'YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT' About 5,000 U.S. physicians quit every two years due to burnout, said Dr. Christine Sinsky, an AMA vice president. The annual cost is about $4.6 billion - including lost revenue from vacancies and recruitment expenses, she said. Hospital survey results in March led the Department of Health and Human Services to warn ""staffing shortages have affected patient care, and that exhaustion and trauma have taken a toll on staff's mental health."" Trauma surgeon Dr. Kari Jerge volunteered to work in a Phoenix COVID-19 ward during last winter's surge. She turned down substantially more pay to return to the ICU after the Delta variant surge. Jerge encourages others to prioritize ""self-preservation,"" but worries about the loss of expertise. ""There is infinite value in a nurse who's been working in the ICU for 20 years and just has a gut feeling when something's going wrong with a patient,"" she said. Nurse Pascaline Muhindura, 40, who cares for COVID-19 patients in Kansas City, Missouri, has advocated for health worker safety since losing a co-worker to the disease early in the pandemic. ""It keeps getting worse and worse. We are heading back to that place - that woke up those emotions again,"" said Muhindura, who added that many employers do not offer adequate insurance coverage for therapy. An ICU fosters the kind of camaraderie forged in battle. A group of Southern California COVID-19 nurses got matching tattoos. Health workers commiserate over crying their way home after tough shifts, support each other on social media, and push colleagues to seek help. ""There is nothing wrong with feeling this way,"" said VA nurse Prott. ""You have to deal with it though."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel to present COVID-19 booster shot data to FDA experts,1619,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Israel this month will present data from an extensive rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is weighing White House plans to begin a booster drive in the United States. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said the ministry had been asked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to brief its advisors at a Sept. 17 meeting. The virtual session will consider a third booster shot of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) vaccine, and may discuss others. read more ""We have been asked to come and present Israel's experience and our data so that we can truly help the whole world to learn,"" Alroy-Preis told Israeli Channel 12 TV news. A week ago Israel began offering a Pfizer COVID-19 booster to people as young as 12 in a campaign that began in July among seniors. Israeli health officials said the drive has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant. Officials have said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine waned five months after administration, making a booster necessary. A third dose, they said, restored the level of protection of the second shot. So far 2.6 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden had been expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorisation for an additional dose. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Column: Crafty lawyering on Texas abortion bill withstood SCOTUS challenge: Greene,5807,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sept 4 (Reuters) - Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, abortion opponents have been trying to scale back or undo it. Texas state senator Bryan Hughes, a former personal injury lawyer and author of the “Heartbeat Act,” led a team in succeeding, at least for now, where so many others have failed. As a social policy, the law, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in Texas but leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, is deeply controversial. House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said it “delivers catastrophe to women in Texas.” Still, some supporters stress that Hughes and the co-architects of the law, which included former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, deserve credit for what amounts to creative lawyering in drafting the measure, known as SB 8. These lawyers figured out how to apply qui tam statutes, which allow private citizens to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of the government, to receive an award in the abortion law context. Hughes, 52, in an interview said the new law “is a very elegant use of the judicial system.” The impetus for creating the unique state-wide legislation came after district attorneys around the country, including some in Texas, publicly stated they would not enforce laws that criminalized early abortions, said Hughes, a Republican from Mineola, Texas. His conclusion? “We had to find another way.” As a lawyer and legislator, he was familiar with qui tam statutes such as the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, which allows private citizens to bring a fraud case and collect a bounty. “The concept was there,” Hughes said. SB 8’s enforcement mechanism also was modeled after an anti-abortion ordinance enacted by the town of Waskom, Texas, in 2019, Hughes said. The ordinance also delegates enforcement to private citizens bringing lawsuits. Mitchell, a former law clerk to the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, provided legal advice to anti-abortion advocates in drafting the ordinance, which was copied by about 30 other cities across the state. He declined to comment. “We continued to refine it,” Hughes said of the Waskom law. ""Lots of lawyers and law professors helped us out,” including Mitchell, whom he describes as a longtime friend and a “very sharp guy.” To John Seago, legislative director of anti-abortion advocacy group Texas Right to Life, the novelty of SB 8 “was that it expands who has standing and takes out the other (criminal) penalties and prohibits state action.” Under the statute, Texas officials have no authority to enforce the new law, which bars abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Private citizens alone are empowered to sue women and anyone who assists them for violating the ban. That private citizen component of the law was key in thwarting the abortion-provider plaintiffs, on procedural grounds, from winning an injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court. The defendants whom the abortion providers had named in the injunction action included a state court judge and a private citizen who allegedly threatened to sue women for seeking abortions. But as the high court majority noted, it's not clear that any of them ""can or will seek to enforce the Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might permit our intervention."" The private citizen, Mark Lee Dickson, said in an affidavit that he has no present intention to try to enforce the law, and no cases are before the judge. So who could the court seek to stop? According to both Hughes and Seago, no one has attempted to sue anyone for performing or assisting in a post-heartbeat abortion since the law went into effect on Sept. 1. Until someone does, SB 8 seems likely to stay on the books, shielded from judicial review. A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred Texas Right to Life from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce the new law. Still, SB 8 won’t get a free pass forever. The five-justice majority wrote that their decision “in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.” It just might take awhile. In crafting the legislation, Hughes, who was elected to the state senate in 2016 and served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years prior, said he drew on his legal background. “Usually in politics, being a lawyer is a negative, but it does come in handy sometimes,"" he said. From 2003 to 2008, Hughes was a litigator at The Lanier Law Firm, which has scored billions of dollars in verdicts for plaintiffs in cases involving hip implants, diabetes medication and talcum powder.

Spanish village hosts first bull running fiesta since pandemic,1615,"VILLASECA DE LA SAGRA, SPAIN, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Ten bulls charged through the streets of Villaseca de la Sagra on Sunday in pursuit of hundreds of runners as the first bull running fiesta was held in Spain since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Villages and towns across Spain hold the fiestas but they were prohibited last year as the country brought in tough health restrictions. Opposition to them has increased in recent years as Spanish society remains divided over the controversial issue of using bulls for sport. No-one was injured during the country's first run, in this village of 1,700 inhabitants which is 65 km (41 miles) south of Madrid. A reveller wearing a protective mask calls a steer during the first running-of-the-bull festival since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic began in Villaseca de la Sagra, central Spain, September 5, 2021. REUTERS/Sergio Perez In order to comply with health restrictions, up to 900 runners were allowed to run ahead of the bulls each day during the festival between Sept 5-12, the council said, while the crowd was limited to 1,300 people per run. ""We were very excited. There were plenty of controls. If people respect restrictions, we can do this all over Spain,"" said Fernando Dominguez, 45, a market worker from Madrid. A 2020 poll, published by the survey company Electomania, found that 47% Spaniards backed banning bullfighting while 18.6% opposed prohibition and 37% opposed bullfighting but did not want it to be banned.

Vietnam sets deadline to vaccinate biggest cities' adults,1709,"HANOI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre, Ho Chi Minh City, and capital Hanoi must vaccinate all of their adult residents with at least one shot by Sept. 15, the ministry of health said on Sunday. Vietnam has one of the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates in the region, with only 3.3% of the country's 98 million people fully vaccinated with two shots, and 15.4% with one shot. The country is battling a worsening COVID-19 outbreak that has infected more than 520,000 people and killed 13,000, the vast majority in the past few months. Ho Chi Minh City, the country's business hub, accounts for half of the infections and 80% of the fatalities. The cities must ""mobilise all capable forces including private medical facilities, to vaccinate people at full capacity"", the ministry said in an emergency dispatch. Government data showed 88% of Ho Chi Minh City's adult population of 6.97 million have been inoculated with at least one shot. The rate is 53% for Hanoi's adult population of 5.75 million. The ministry also set the Sept. 15 deadline for the southern industrial provinces of Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long An to vaccinate all of their adult populations. It said Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong and Long An have been allocated enough vaccine doses for the vaccination drive. Vietnam has so far received 33 million coronavirus vaccine doses, and it expects to receive 17 million more by the end of this month, the government said late on Sunday. Vietnam could be facing a lengthy battle against the coronavirus and cannot rely on lockdown and quarantine measures indefinitely, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said last week. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
All six Israel MPC members voted to keep rates unchanged-minutes,2367,"JERUSALEM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - All six rate setters at the Bank of Israel voted to keep the benchmark interest rate (ILINR=ECI) at 0.1% on Aug. 23, though one member believed it may be time to start tightening policy, minutes of the discussions showed on Sunday. For the second straight meeting, the monetary policy committee voted 6-0 to leave rates unchanged. The economy rebounded in the second quarter after most COVID-related restrictions were lifted, while inflation moved near a 2% rate. One member, the minutes said, was of the opinion that the strong economic data and the increase in the inflation environment ""could have made it possible to begin gradually reducing the extent of monetary policy accommodation"". ""However in view of the renewed increase in morbidity it is best to be very cautious and at this time to retain the current policy,"" the minutes said, citing the view of the policymaker. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualised 15.4% in the April-June period from the prior three months, while the inflation rate reached 1.9% in July from below zero earlier in 2021. Yet, COVID-19 infections from the Delta variant have spiked in recent weeks, despite a rapid vaccination rollout in which many adults have already received a third shot although with the number of serious cases fairly low, officials are reluctant to impose a fourth lockdown. ""The Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity, in view of the increased health risks in Israel and abroad,"" the minutes said. ""Therefore, the (MPC) will continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary."" Policymakers noted ""there are no signs of an outbreak of inflation"" even though prices of non-tradable items continue to rise, while the rate of increase in prices of tradable goods was stable. At the same time, MPC members noted that economic activity returned to its long term trend in most industries but tourism, hospitality and culture continued to struggle. ""The committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for the process of exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function,"" the minutes showed.

UK minister: no decision yet on COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children,2054,"LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday said a decision had not yet been taken on whether healthy children aged 12- to 15-years-old should be vaccinated against COVID-19, following reports that a rollout could begin in the coming days. Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday declined to recommend vaccinations for children in that group, taking a precautionary approach due to a rare risk of heart inflammation, but adding the issue was finely balanced. read more The government is consulting medical advisers to seek advice on wider considerations, such as the impact on schools, and may still give the go-ahead to broad vaccination of the age group. Some newspapers reported confidence among ministers that the chief medical officers would swiftly back shots for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, but Zahawi said the government would not prejudge the decision. ""No decision will be made until we hear back from the chief medical officers,"" Zahawi told the BBC. Children are being widely vaccinated already in the United States, Israel and many European countries. British officials have emphasised that 12- to 15-year-olds who are vulnerable to COVID-19 are already eligible for vaccination, as well as all people over 16. The four nations of the United Kingdom, which have recorded 133,000 COVID deaths, control their own health policy, although all have followed JCVI advice on vaccine rollout thus far. Zahawi confirmed that proof of vaccination would be required in England for some large events from the end of this month once all adults have been offered two shots. read more He also said that the government was still finalising plans for a vaccine booster programme following interim advice from the JCVI that one might be needed for the vulnerable and elderly. read more ""It is very likely that we will begin boosting those groups, as... I hope the interim then becomes final advice, by the middle of this month,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand tried to deport attacker for years after he arrived as refugee,3607,"WELLINGTON/COLOMBO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - New Zealand had tried for years to deport the knife-wielding militant who wounded seven people at a mall in Auckland last week, the government said after it released more details on the attacker following the lifting of a court suppression order. Court documents made public on Sunday identified the attacker as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, an ethnic Tamil Muslim from Sri Lanka. He had arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago on a student visa seeking refugee status, which was granted in 2013. Police in Sri Lanka were making background checks on Samsudeen and talking to his family and friends for more information, said spokesperson Nalin Thalduwa. ""As far as I am aware the New Zealand government has not made a formal request for Sri Lanka to commence an investigation so we are simply gathering information at the moment,"" Thalduwa said. New Zealand police were following Samsudeen and shot him dead about a minute after he launched his attack on Friday after picking up a knife from a supermarket display. He had been convicted and imprisoned for about three years before being released in July. Samsudeen's family issued a statement to the New Zealand media describing their shock at the ""terrible event"". After his arrest Samsudeen ""used to call me once every three months or so. We felt his change and everyone used to scold him, especially his two bothers,"" his mother, who lives in the Muslim-majority town of Kattankudy on Sri Lanka's eastern coast, told a local news channel. Samsudeen was inspired by the Islamic State militant group and was being monitored constantly but he could not be kept in prison by law any longer, the New Zealand government has said. He came to the attention of the police and security services in 2016 after he expressed sympathy on Facebook for militant attacks, violent war-related videos and comments advocating violent extremism. The authorities say they later discovered his refugee status was fraudulently obtained, so the government sought to cancel his visa and issued deportation notices. But Samsudeen appealed against the deportation, and since he was in prison, his appeal could not proceed until his criminal trial ended in May this year. The attack has led to questions about a loophole in New Zealand's counterterrorism laws that allowed Samsudeen to remain free despite authorities being aware of the threat he posed. The government has promised to tighten the law, in particular to criminalise planning a militant attack. ""We will continue to review our immigration laws alongside the terrorist suppression law, and I'm sure if there are ways we can improve it, we will,"" Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told a news conference. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on Saturday that unsuccessful attempts to deport Samsudeen were a ""frustrating process"" for the government. Of the seven people wounded in the attack three are in critical condition. One has been released from hospital. Samsudeen's family said in the statement they were heartbroken. ""We hope to find out with you all, what happened in Aathil's case and what we all could have done to prevent this,"" the family said in the statement, released by his brother Aroos. The family said Samsudeen was suffering from mental health problems and his condition got worse over the past 10 years as he spent more time in prison and dealing with court cases. ""He wanted to share the sufferings and injustices. He saw himself as someone fighting those injustices,"" the family said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Hurricane Ida death toll in Louisiana rises to 12,3239,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida's toll rose to 12 storm deaths in Louisiana on Saturday, still far outpaced by the dozens killed in flooded Northeast U.S. states where President Biden is heading next week to assess damage. New York and New Jersey were among the four northern states that started the Labor Day holiday weekend digging through debris left by the deadly deluge that killed more than 44 people and caused public transportation in New York City to grind to a halt. Transportation operators promised to restore some lines before the start of the workweek on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden will visit storm-ravaged New Jersey and New York on Tuesday, just days after he traveled to hard-hit Louisiana where the storm made landfall almost a week ago. His Northeast travels will include Manville, New Jersey, and the Queens borough of New York City, the White House said. read more The confirmed storm-related death toll in Louisiana rose to 12 on Saturday, Governor Bel Edwards told a news conference. He warned those numbers could increase because so many people are relying on power from generators, which were blamed for four carbon monoxide deaths among the 12 deaths, the governor said. More than 718,500 customers in Louisiana are still without power, down from the 1.1 million people that Hurricane Ida's devastation initially left in the dark, the governor said. After Biden mentioned the possibility of using a cruise ship to house workers trying to restore power, the Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line said it would deploy its Grand Classica flagship to New Orleans to house 1,500 front line workers under a charter agreement with Entergy Corp. “Hurricane relief and humanitarian charters are something we’ve done several times in the past, and we are proud to be able to move quickly to action now in this way, helping facilitate relief for the thousands of people who remain without power across the region,"" Kevin Sheehan, president of the cruise line, said in a statement.

AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. companies including Lyft Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and Silicon Laboratories Inc voiced their displeasure on Friday at new Texas laws on abortion, handguns, and voting limitations, a fresh sign of increased efforts by some firms to signal their commitment to social responsibility. Lyft (LYFT.O) and Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) said they will cover all legal fees for the ride-hail companies' drivers sued under a law that puts in place a near-total ban on abortion. Lyft will also donate $1 million to women's health provider Planned Parenthood, chief executive Logan Green said on Twitter. ""This is an attack on women's access to healthcare and on their right to choose,"" Green said of the new Texas law. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted in response to Green's announcement that his company would cover drivers' legal fees in the same way, thanking Green for taking the initiative. The ban, which took effect Wednesday, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. This potentially includes drivers who unknowingly take women to clinics for abortion procedures. The Lyft Driver Hub is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 20, 2019.

The reaction to the law change in Texas comes at a time when many companies are seeking to burnish their corporate and environmental governance credentials with consumers. Companies also reacted to the Texas legislature this week passing the final version of a bill that outlaws drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and gives poll watchers more power, widely seen as restricting voting access. ""We hoped for a different outcome for this legislation, and we're disappointed by this result,"" an American Airlines (AAL.O) spokesperson said in an email. A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N), based in Texas, said, ""As a global company of 60,000 team members, HPE encourages our team members to engage in the political process where they live and work and make their voices heard through advocacy and at the voting booth."" Meanwhile, a law allowing people to carry concealed handguns without any permit went into effect in Texas on Wednesday. ""Looking at the abortion law, or the gun law, or the voting law, it's a form of vigilante justice, where you're empowering individuals to enforce the law,"" said Tyson Tuttle, the CEO of Austin-based Silicon Laboratories (SLAB.O). ""It's been a rough week in Texas and a harbinger of what's to come across the country."""

"Osaka suffers shock loss in U.S. Open, plans to take break from the sport",3588,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Two-time champion Naomi Osaka's U.S. Open title defence ended in tears on Friday, as she suffered a stunning defeat in the third round to Canadian Leylah Fernandez 5-7 7-6(2) 6-4, and told reporters she planned to take a break from the sport. ""I feel like I'm kind of at this point where I'm trying to figure out what I want to do. Honestly I don't know when I'm going to play my next tennis match,"" she said, breaking down in tears at a post-match press conference and pulling the brim of her visor over her eyes. ""I think I'm going to take a break from playing for a while."" Playing in her first Grand Slam since pulling out of the French Open earlier this year and disclosing her battle with depression, Osaka's return to Flushing Meadows did not go to plan, as she wordlessly left the court after uncharacteristically losing her cool in the second set tiebreak. The third seed whacked her racquet and then flung it onto the court twice in frustration as Fernandez scored five straight points in the tiebreak, in a series of superb play. Osaka did not receive a warning or a code violation and left the court between sets, later telling reporters she struggled to contain her emotions. ""I'm really sorry about that,"" she said. ""I was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point. ""Like normally I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don't go my way, and I feel like you can feel that. I'm not really sure why it happens the way it happens now."" Her troubles continued as the 18-year-old Canadian broke her serve to kick off the third set, and Osaka hit a ball into the stands in the second game, prompting a warning from the chair umpire. In the ninth game Osaka rushed through her serves, not even waiting for the crowd to quiet down, as she was unable to create a single break point opportunity in the final set. A fan favourite, Osaka has struggled with uneven play since she withdrew from Roland Garros earlier this year amid a public row with tournament officials over required media appearances, which she said had a negative impact on her mental health. She told fans that she has struggled with depression for years, prompting new discussion around mental health in professional sport. ""How do I go around saying this? I feel like for me recently, like, when I win I don't feel happy. I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad, said Osaka. ""I don't think that's normal."" FERNANDEZ BREAKTHROUGH It was a breakthrough performance for Fernandez, who reached the fourth round of a major for the first time just a few days shy of her 19th birthday. She fired off 28 winners across the three sets, and said in a televised interview that she worked at ""just finding the solutions"" during the match. ""She's a great server, she's been hitting aces left, right and centre,"" Fernandez said of Osaka. She told reporters she was able to rely on in her own serve, as well, as she won more than three quarters of her first-serve points and fired off six aces. ""I've been serving really well the past few matches. Today I just went on court with a lot of confidence on my serve, trusting it, trusting that I'm going to hit my targets when I needed to, and I did,"" she said. It was the second shock upset of the evening at Flushing Meadows, after 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz knocked world number three Stefanos Tsitsipas out in a five-set thriller. read more Fernandez next faces 2016 champion Angelique Kerber of Germany.

Beef giant Brazil halts China exports after confirming two mad cow disease cases,1688,"SAO PAULO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, has suspended beef exports to its No. 1 customer China after confirming two cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease in two separate domestic meat plants, the agriculture ministry said on Saturday. The suspension, which is part of an animal health pact agreed between China and Brazil and is designed to allow Beijing time to take stock of the problem, begins immediately, the ministry said in a statement. China will decide when to begin importing again, it added. The suspension is a major blow for Brazilian farmers: China and Hong Kong buy more than half of Brazil's beef exports. The cases were identified in meat plants in the states of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais, the ministry said. It said they were the fourth and fifth cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease that have been detected in Brazil in 23 years. It said ""atypical"" mad cow disease develops spontaneously and is not related to eating contaminated foods. Brazil has never had a case of ""classic"" mad cow disease, it said. The two cases were confirmed on Friday after samples were sent to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lab in Alberta, Canada, the ministry said. The OIE had subsequently been informed of the two cases, in compliance with international norms, the ministry said. The ministry said there was no risk to animal or human health. Brazil's government will hope the suspension is lifted quickly. The country's powerful agribusiness sector is one of the main drivers of its long-lagging economy. China is Brazil's top trade partner, and buys vast quantities of its commodities. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thai PM survives no confidence vote as more anti-government protests planned,1824,"BANGKOK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and five cabinet ministers comfortably survived a vote of no confidence in parliament on Saturday as activists planned more protests against the government. Prayuth received 264 votes in favour and 208 against. Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and four other cabinet ministers also survived the censure motion in similar fashion. The opposition needed 242 of the 482 parliamentary votes to oust the prime minister. Prayuth said he remained confident after the vote. Lawmakers over four days accused his government of mishandling the pandemic and criticised him for the severe economic impact, taking aim at the government’s slow vaccine rollout as a result of not making advance vaccine orders and deciding not to join the international COVAX vaccine-supply scheme. Prayuth has stood by those decisions. This is the third censure motion the government has survived and comes as pro-democracy protesters plan more demonstrations on Saturday. Recent rallies have turned violent, with security forces using tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets against protesters who threw stones and firecrackers. Thailand has reported over 1.2 million infections and over 12,000 coronavirus-related deaths, most of them since April due to the Delta variant. Authorities reported the largest single-day increase in cases in mid-August with over 23,000 cases. The vaccine rollout began in June amid the country's most severe outbreak, with people unable to find medical treatment and some dying at home. About 13% of Thailand's more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated. The government cut its 2021 economic growth forecast for a third time, to 0.7%-1.2% from 1.5%-2.5%. The economy shrank 6.1% last year. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID in the rear-view mirror as Zandvoort fans cheer on Verstappen,2344,"ZANDVOORT, Sept 4 (Reuters) - As 70,000 Max Verstappen fans made their way to the Dutch Formula One Grand Prix at the small beach resort of Zandvoort this weekend, COVID-19 and social distancing seemed almost like a distant memory. Even though Alfa Romeo driver Kimi Raikkonen had to pull out of the race after a positive COVID-19 test , fans on Saturday said the virus was the last thing on their minds. ""Once you get past the entrance, you just forget about it,"" a young woman who travelled 240 kilometres (150 miles) from the southern town of Maastricht to see local hero Max Verstappen said. ""It's just so good to be among so many people again. Let's hope it can set the example for other events to be allowed as well."" The grand prix, the first in the Netherlands in 36 years, is the country's first mass event since the pandemic arrived, with music festivals and other cultural events still limited to tiny audiences to limit the spread of the disease. This apparently uneven treatment has already sparked criticism in recent weeks, and images of thousands of people thronging the pathways at the race circuit fuelled the discontent on Friday, as many artists took to social media to express their anger. But health minister Hugo de Jonge said no exceptions were made for the grand prix, as the event followed the rules for hosting a large crowd, meaning all spectators needed a negative COVID-19 test to get in and had to remain in their assigned seats as much as possible. ""But there is friction between the rules and the reality on the ground"", De Jonge said, commenting on the masses of people who were clearly not in their seats. ""We can't avoid crowded situations. But we will manage the flow better and are asking people to remain in their seats longer"", Dutch GP spokesman Simon Keijzer said on Saturday. This did not prevent big crowds forming again, however, as soon as the Formula One drivers left the track and fans went looking for food, drinks and toilets. The rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has kept infections in the Netherlands relatively high in recent weeks, forcing the government to reinforce several social distancing measures last month. It also limited the grand prix to two-thirds of its original capacity of 105,000 tickets for visitors per day. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. seen funding humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, but not its government",3131,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is likely to finance U.N. and other agencies providing humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan but there is virtually no chance it will directly fund a new Taliban-led government, congressional aides said on Friday. The United States has been a massive funder of Afghanistan since its 2001 invasion to topple the Taliban, setting aside roughly $130 billion for security, governance and development and humanitarian needs. Aides to the Democrats who control both houses of Congress and to Republicans said lawmakers were nearly certain to provide humanitarian aid for internally displaced Afghans and refugees but not to the government itself, at least for now. ""It would be difficult to convince members of Congress to do anything that would appear to be supporting the Taliban government,"" said a senior Senate Democratic aide, citing the absence of oversight and a reluctance ""to support a government that is anathema to us."" A senior Senate Republican aide concurred. ""Republicans would absolutely not support giving money to the Taliban,"" the Republican aide said, saying they do not want to provide any money until Americans and Afghans who worked with the United States can leave Afghanistan. While aides said there was an understanding that agencies such as the World Food Program and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would need funds, the Republican said lawmakers would want strict conditions on how it is spent. ""There needs to be a distinct look at what this is going to look like and how this is going to flow,"" he said. For fiscal 2022 starting Oct. 1, Congress set aside $136.45 million in the Economic Support Fund, which the Democratic aide said was the source for underwriting Afghan government salaries, and $52.03 million for Afghan humanitarian aid, according to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. The aides all but ruled out contributing to the salaries of Afghan civil servants who, working under a Taliban-led government, might oversee such basic services as running schools, health clinics and hospitals. ""I find it hard to imagine that happening, in part because how would we know that the funds weren't ending up in the wrong hands?"" said the senior Senate Democratic aide. The aide said Congress might appropriate as much as the $144 million to $279 million it has set aside annually in the last decade for Afghan humanitarian needs, depending on what U.N. agencies and others determine is required. The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether it would request additional funds for Afghanistan. Taliban sources said the group's co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would lead a new government set to be announced soon. Its first task may be to stave off the collapse of an economy grappling with drought and the ravages of a 20-year war. read more Taliban fighters entered Kabul on Aug. 15.

France could ease health pass restrictions in large shopping malls - minister,981,"PARIS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - France could ease health pass restrictions that are hurting the activity of large shopping malls if the COVID-19 epidemic situation keeps improving, Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Saturday. ""The health situation is improving. If this is confirmed, we will be able to ease the rules,"" Borne told France Inter radio, adding that this could be decided ""in the coming days"".

Two-time champion Osaka's title defence ended in tears as she suffered a stunning 5-7 7-6(2) 6-4 loss to Canadian Leylah Fernandez and the Japanese said she planned to take a break from the sport. ""I honestly don't know when I'm going to play my next tennis match,"" she said. ""I think I'm going to take a break from playing for a while."" Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, the heir apparent to Rafa Nadal, upset Tsitsipas 6-3 4-6 7-6 (2) 0-6 7-6 (5) to move into the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in his career.

Japan PM Suga to back vaccine minister Kono to succeed him,2516,"TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japan's outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will back the popular minister in charge of the nation's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, to succeed him, Nippon News Network reported on Saturday. Political manoeuvring was heating up among potential candidates and ruling party grandees on Saturday, a day after Suga's surprise announcement that he was stepping down, ending a one-year term as prime minister that has seen his support crumble as COVID-19 surged. Hours after Suga's announcement, broadcaster TBS reported, without citing sources, that Kono intended to run for head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Kono told reporters only that he wanted to consult party colleagues before deciding. Suga is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election scheduled for Sept. 29. The LDP leader will become prime minister given the party's majority in parliament. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular among young voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics, which is dominated by older men less adept with social media. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring, while several others have voiced interest. With no clear front-runner, the stance of Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe will be closely watched, given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, analysts say. Abe, who stepped down citing ill health last September after a record eight-year term, had publicly backed Suga's reelection. With Suga out, Abe now supports former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, who is close to the former premier, TBS said. Takaichi, who would be Japan's first female prime minister, had been seen as struggling to gain the backing of the 20 LDP lawmakers needed to run in the party race. Abe's support could boost her chances. Kishida said on Saturday he would leave the national sales tax at 10% if elected, reiterating that he would fund a new economic package worth tens of trillions of yen (hundreds of billions of dollars) by issuing more government bonds. ""I'm not thinking of touching the sales tax for the time being,"" Kishida told a Nippon News Network programme. ""We then must consider Japan's finances from the standpoint of how to make use of the fruit of economic growth."" Before Abe, Japan had six prime ministers in as many years.

"Australia reports record daily COVID-19 cases, braces for worse",2195,"MELBOURNE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australia, struggling to quell its worst wave of COVID-19, reported 1,756 infections on Saturday, another record high, and officials warned that worse is yet to come, urging people to get vaccinated. Most of the cases were again in New South Wales, which has been fighting an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant since mid-June. The state reported 1,533 new cases and four further deaths. Neighbouring Victoria reported 190 cases, the Australian Capital Territory 32 and Queensland one. Recent daily infections are running about double the levels of Australia's previous worst wave of the pandemic a year ago. Believing this outbreak cannot be eliminated - a successful strategy used by states and territories in earlier waves - New South Wales and Victoria authorities have focussed on speeding inoculations to make the cases less virulent. Although infections in Victoria, in its sixth lockdown, dropped slightly from Friday's 208, health authorities said the outbreak has not peaked. ""The overall trend is a slow and steady increase. That's why vaccination is so critical, as is following the rules,"" Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told a press conference. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, expects more than 1,000 new cases a day for at least two more weeks, with hospital admissions likely to peak in October. On Saturday, health officials said 137 of the 173 people in intensive care in hospitals were not vaccinated. Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, together home to nearly 60% of Australia's 25 million people, have been under strict lockdown for weeks. That is expected to continue until 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. At the current pace, Australia may reach that threshold in late October or early November. Only about a third of those aged 16 and over have been vaccinated, although the pace has picked up considerably, with the federal government racing to secure more Pfizer shots. Australia has recorded just under 60,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,036 deaths, far fewer than many comparable countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Fertility app maker Flo Health faces consolidated privacy lawsuit,3793,"(Reuters) - Flo Health Inc is facing a consolidated class action complaint accusing the period and fertility-tracking app developer of sharing users' sensitive health information with third parties without app users' knowledge. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in California federal court, also named the alleged third parties - Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, and data analytics companies Flurry Inc and AppsFlyer Inc - as defendants. Flo Health, through its counsel from Dechert, declined on Friday to comment on the pending litigation. Lawyers for Facebook, Google, Flurry and AppsFlyer, of the law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, Hunton Andrews Kurth and Latham & Watkins, respectively, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The newly filed action brings together plaintiffs from seven proposed class actions filed against Flo Health earlier this year. The first complaint stemming from the alleged unlawful data disclosure came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Flo Health in January. Users of the women's health app hand over personal information to Flo Health, including ""intimate details"" about sexual health and menstrual cycles, among other things, to use the app, the complaint said. Flo Health allegedly violated users' privacy by disclosing that information to third parties through software development kits (SDKs) incorporated into its app, despite the company's privacy policies and ""public assurances"" that it would not share data, the complaint said. In using the third parties' SDKs, Flo Health transmitted the personal information back to other defendants, which allegedly ""knew that the data collected and received from Flo Health included intimate health data"" but didn't stop that because the data is ""vital to their business,"" such as for marketing and data analytics purposes, according to the complaint. The lawsuit asserts several claims against Flo Health, including invasion of privacy, breach of contract, and violation of the federal Stored Communications Act. The plaintiffs accuse the other companies of ""aiding and abetting"" Flo Health's alleged practices, among other claims, including a Federal Wiretap Act claim against Facebook, Google and Flurry. Plaintiffs' counsel filed a separate motion Thursday seeking the appointment of lawyers from three firms as interim co-lead counsel. The filing touts the data privacy, consumer protection and complex class action experience of the proposed leaders, and highlights the proposed structure as reflecting a ""diverse slate of attorneys."" Carol Villegas of Labaton Sucharow, Diana Zinser of Spector Roseman & Kodroff and Christian Levis of Lowey Dannenberg are seeking the leadership roles. The proposed leaders ""embody the diversity necessary to vindicate claims for women whose private intimate health data was disclosed without authorization,"" the lawyers wrote.

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2810,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE), a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout. ""It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know,"" Fauci said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers. FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court's rightward lurch put Roe v. Wade on the brink,4992,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump made a statement that seemed brash at the time: If he were elected and got the chance to nominate justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion would be overturned. By this time next year, with the court having tilted further to the right thanks to Trump's three appointments to the nation's highest court, his prediction could come true. The court's decision on Wednesday night to allow Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect in apparent contravention of the 1973 Roe decision suggests the court is closer than ever to overturning a ruling U.S. conservatives have long reviled. ""We don't know how quickly or openly the court will reverse Roe, but this decision suggests that it's only a matter of time,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion history at Florida State University College of Law. Two generations of American women have grown up with access to abortion, although its use has declined over the past decade. But while Roe handed liberals a victory on a crucial issue of the times, it also helped to power the religious right into a galvanizing force as it worked to get the decision overturned. Since Congress never acted to formalize abortion rights - which shows what a hot button issue it is politically - the same court that once legalized abortion has the power to allow states to ban it. In the coming months, the court will weigh whether to throw Roe out altogether as the justices consider whether to uphold a 15-week abortion ban in the state of Mississippi. Unlike the Texas dispute, in which the justices did not directly address whether Roe should be reversed, they will in the Mississippi case. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022, just months before an election that will determine whether the Democrats retain their narrow majority in both houses of Congress. The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe, in 1992, opponents were bitterly disappointed when the court's moderates banded together and upheld abortion rights. Although the Supreme Court had a conservative majority, it was not deemed conservative enough. Storm clouds roll in over the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., September 1, 2021. REUTERS/Tom Brenner MCCONNELL'S ROLE The reason why the outcome could be different now is in part thanks to the decades-long efforts of conservative legal activists to re-shape the court, which bore fruit during Trump's presidency. Trump was aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as the death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which gave him a third vacancy to fill just before he lost the November 2020 election. All three Trump nominees were pre-vetted by conservative lawyers associated with the Federalist Society legal group. All three -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were in the majority as the court allowed the Texas abortion law to go into effect. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority, which means that even if one peels away - as Chief Justice John Roberts did on Wednesday and in another abortion case in 2020 - the conservative bloc still retains the upper hand. Conservative Republican McConnell played a key role in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees to the bench. Democrats' hopes were raised early in 2016, when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died, that what had been a 5-4 conservative majority on the high court could switch to a 5-4 liberal majority for the first time in decades. McConnell crushed those dreams, refusing to move forward with then-Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, when Trump came into office in early 2017 he was able to immediately nominate Gorsuch, who was duly confirmed by McConnell's Republican-led Senate. Trump and McConnell then pushed through the nomination of Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 despite allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee, which he denied. Kennedy was a conservative but had voted to uphold abortion rights in key cases, including in 1992. Finally, in September 2020, Ginsburg died. In an unprecedented move, Trump and McConnell installed Barrett just days before Election Day on Nov. 7, leading to widespread accusations of hypocrisy but cementing the conservative majority. Despite the favorable winds, some anti-abortion advocates are playing down the importance of the Supreme Court's Texas ruling, and say the fate of Roe v Wade is still up in the air. ""I've long thought the court should overturn Roe because it is not based on what the Constitution actually says,"" said John Bursch, a lawyer at conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, before adding: ""This order doesn’t give a signal either way about what the majority will do in the Mississippi case.""

Latham requires vaccinations following FDA approval,3399,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Latham & Watkins, one of the highest-grossing and largest law firms in the U.S., will require all of its employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-October. Latham may be the first major U.S. law firm to implement a vaccination mandate following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's full approval of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine last month. About half of the 200 highest-grossing U.S. law firms are now requiring vaccinations, and in many firms, the percentage of employees who are vaccinated is between 90% to 95%, according to Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann. The first law firm to announce a vaccination mandate was Davis Wright Tremaine in January. Since then many more firms have issued mandates, particularly as U.S. coronavirus cases began spiking again due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Other law firms, including Baker McKenzie, Dechert, Dentons and Morrison & Foerster announced their vaccination mandates last week. But representatives at those firms confirmed those mandates were announced internally prior to the FDA approval. Latham's executive committee, in a memo sent to all U.S. employees on Wednesday, said more than 95% of its U.S. personnel and ""virtually 100%"" of its U.S. partners have been vaccinated. The memo was first published on the legal blog Above The Law on Friday; a representative for Latham confirmed the memo's authenticity and declined to comment further. The memo specifically cites FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine as one of the reasons why the firm is mandating vaccinations. Industry consultants said they expect the FDA approval will push more law firms and companies into adopting vaccination mandates. FDA approval gives law firms more legal coverage to mandate vaccinations, said Marcie Borgal Shunk, president of law firm consultancy The Tilt Institute. She said some people questioned whether a COVID-19 vaccine could be mandated when the FDA hasn't given full approval. ""With this step, law firms will gain confidence in their legal footing,"" Borgal Shunk added. Employers in many other industries are requiring their workforce to be vaccinated as well. One national survey of nearly 1,000 employers said more than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment. Google's parent Alphabet Inc, Walmart Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine.

"Porsche, Puma to join Germany's DAX as index expands",2285,"FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - German carmaker Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) and sportswear maker Puma (PUMG.DE) will join the nation's premier DAX stock index, as it expands to 40 from 30 companies in the biggest overhaul of its 33-year history, the exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) said on Friday. The expansion, contemplated for years, got a push in reaction to the collapse of German payments company Wirecard, which dramatically fell from grace in 2020, just two years after promotion to the benchmark index. A bigger index means greater diversification and potentially more stability for investors. The move promotes an array of companies to an index previously reserved for German corporate titans like Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Siemens (SIEM.NS). Other new entrants include the plane manufacturer Airbus (AIR.PA) and the online fashion retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE). The changes are effective on Monday, Sept. 20. Wirecard's demise embarrassed the German government and stained the nation's reputation as a safe haven investment, accelerating the reform imitative backed by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer. Deutsche Boerse announced the overhaul plans last November, saying the changes would improve quality of the DAX indexes and align them with international standards. . Over the past year, Deutsche Boerse has also imposed more stringent membership criteria in financial reporting and profitability. Manfred Schlumberger, portfolio manager at Starcapital, said he doubted the expansion would make the index more attractive. U.S. indexes are more attractive than their European counterparts because they have a high portion of future-oriented industries like technology and communication, he said. ""The DAX doesn't get that through the overhaul because those industries simply don't exist here,"" he said The remaining new entrants include: health technology company Siemens Healthineers (SHLG.DE), flavour and fragrance maker Symrise (SY1G.DE), lab equipment maker Sartorius (SATG.DE), chemicals distributor Brenntag (BNRGn.DE), meal-kit company Hellofresh (HFGG.DE), and genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE).

U.S. COVID-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer - source,2630,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House plan to offer COVID-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot. It is not clear whether the Food and Drug Administration will have enough time to review Moderna's submission before the meeting. Johnson & Johnson has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject. Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month. As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that COVID infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation’s top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."" Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said. U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier. The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the Food and Drug Administration determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers. FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Brazil's Bolsonaro signs law that could break COVID-19 vaccine patents,811,"BRASILIA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday signed off on a law allowing for vaccine and medication patents to be broken in a public emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. But the right-wing leader vetoed the provisions that patent holders would need to transfer the knowledge and supply the raw materials needed to duplicate the vaccines and medications. According to a statement from his office, those provisions were seen as being too difficult to implement and discouraging investment in researching new technologies. Bolsonaro had previously criticized the law as potentially harming Brazil's commercial relationships. Under the law, the president is the one who would determine when to break a patent in an emergency. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"As COVID surges, more Florida school districts revolt against governor's mask rules",5235,"TAVARES, Fla., Sept 3 (Reuters) - In a scene replayed across the United States, angry parents and activists streamed into a meeting of the Florida's Lake County school board on Thursday where it considered whether to mandate mask-wearing for students and staff due to COVID. Some opponents of the mask proposal brandished signs that read “Let Our Children Breathe.” Even with Florida seeing a record number of coronavirus cases, one attendee called the pandemic ""overblown."" Another was escorted out by deputies after yelling at board members. The proposal would require staff and students to wear masks for 14 days at schools with COVID positivity rates at or above 5%. But Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, effectively banned similar mandates in July. Since DeSantis' order, more than a dozen Florida counties have rebelled and voted to require masks to protect students and teachers as the Delta variant sweeps across the state. This week, the state's Department of Education sanctioned two counties that passed school mask requirements. The battle between DeSantis and the state's school systems echoes larger fights across the country. Other Republican-run states such as Arizona and Texas have also banned mask mandates in schools even as COVID cases have soared in their states, as parents and voters are sharply divided over safety measures and personal freedoms. The pushback in Florida against the Republican governor initially was led by large urban school districts run by Democrats. But this week saw more conservative counties that backed Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election also defying DeSantis and instituting their own mandates. Earlier this week, populous Brevard County along Florida’s east coast, which went for Trump over President Joe Biden by more than 16 percentage points in November, narrowly voted to approve a 30-day school mask mandate. A day later, Hernando County, which supported Trump over Biden by almost 30 points, also passed a mandate, but one that allows parents to opt out. In Lake County near Orlando, which also strongly backed Trump, a school official said on Thursday that more than 1,000 students of the 36,000 in the district had tested positive for the virus. The board listened to more than three hours of public comment on the mask proposal then postponed a decision. Some 280 people spoke or sent emails on the issue, and two-thirds of them supported the idea, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Still, proponents of a mask mandate were booed and heckled by the crowd in attendance. “This topic has completely polarized communities,” said Andrea Messina, president of the Florida School Boards Association. Residents demonstrate before the Lake County School Board started an emergency meeting to discuss mask mandates to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tavares, Florida, U.S., September 2, 2021. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo 'ABSOLUTE CRISIS' While the conflict centers on whether state or local governments are best equipped to make decisions on health and safety, it also has become a political challenge for DeSantis, whose state has once again become a COVID-19 hotbed. After being widely praised last year when cases declined and the state’s economy seemed revived, DeSantis has faced renewed criticism for his opposition to masks and employer vaccine mandates. Florida on Aug. 26 saw a single-day record number of new cases of the virus – almost 28,000 – since the pandemic began. A spokesperson for DeSantis, Christina Pushaw, defended the ban on school mandates, saying the governor is ""protecting the rights of families and children from all levels of government overreach."" At the Brevard County meeting on Monday, Misty Belford, the chair of the school board who a month earlier had opposed a mask mandate, switched her vote and gave proponents a 3-2 majority. Belford changed her mind, she told Reuters, after watching the district’s caseload spike, including a 49% increase in student cases from one week to the next. One school was closed for two days after most of its students were quarantined. “We are at an absolute crisis point,"" Belford said. But board member Katye Campbell, who voted against the mandate, said she worries about negative effects on students from requiring masks, such as asthma flare-ups, suicidal ideation and panic attacks. “There is nothing easy about this decision because our community is so divided,” Campbell said. Belford said she was relying on a decision from a Florida court last week that declared the DeSantis rule illegal. DeSantis on Thursday appealed the ruling. Earlier this week, the Florida Board of Education said it would penalize two counties that voted for mask mandates without providing a parental opt-out, Alachua and Broward, by withholding funds from the districts for the board members’ salaries. Leanetta McNealy, chair of the Alachua County school board, said her board voted for the mask mandate last month based on scientific evidence that it would help mitigate the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. “I’d rather have a decrease in my compensation than have a death under my watch,” she said.

Psilocybin lawyer asks 9th Circ to weigh workaround to fed drug law,3389,"(Reuters) - A Seattle, Washington, clinic on Thursday urged the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to order the federal Drug Enforcement Authority to offer a way for terminally ill patients to try psilocybin, the active chemical in hallucinogenic mushrooms, to treat their anxiety and depression. Much of the argument, before Circuit Judges Mark Bennett, Sandra Ikuta and Ryan Nelson, focused on whether the DEA's conclusion that it could not waive any part of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which bans psilocybin except for limited research purposes, could even be appealed. The clinic, the Advanced Integrative Medical Science (AIMS) Institute, asked the agency for permission to use psilocybin under Washington and federal ""right to try"" laws, which allow terminally ill patients to try drugs that are still under investigation. Forty-one states have passed such laws. Psilocybin has been the subject of clinical trials to treat terminal patients' anxiety and depression, but remains a so-called Schedule I substance under the CSA, meaning doctors cannot prescribe it. According to AIMS' petition for review, the DEA responded that there was no way for it to grant a waiver for the use of a Schedule I drug under right-to-try laws. At the outset of Thursday's argument, Nelson pressed AIMS' attorney, Matt Zorn of Yetter Coleman, to explain what exactly the clinic was appealing. ""How can a response to a request for instructions ever be a final order?"" he asked. ""It's because of the specific response in this case, and that response was, there is no process,"" Zorn said. ""Because the agency said there is nothing for you to use, we have nowhere to go."" The state of Washington, represented by Deputy Solicitor General Peter Gonick, weighed in to support the clinic. Gonick said the case raised the ""federalism concern that, where possible, statutes should be construed to avoid federal interference with areas traditionally left to states, such as regulation of the medical profession here."" He said that Congress and state legislatures had passed right-to-try laws because they recognized that the federal drug approval process was ""just too long"" for some terminally ill patients. Thomas Pulham of the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing for the DEA, said the agency's determination that the CSA did not allow it to grant waivers under right-to-try laws was not subject to review. ""It was an informal response to a request for assistance from a member of a regulated community that did nothing more than provide the agency's view on existing law,"" he said. When Nelson asked how the clinic could get the issue before a court, Pulham responded that if it administered psilocybin, and the DEA brought an enforcement action, it could challenge that action as unlawful. The answer did not fully satisfy the judge. ""Usually we don't require a party to go and subject themselves to liability in order to appeal,"" he said. The court did not clearly indicate how or when it would rule. The case is AIMS v. USDEA, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-70544.

Impel NeuroPharma enters migraine market with FDA nod for nasal spray,1875,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Impel NeuroPharma Inc's (IMPL.O) nasal spray to treat migraine got approval from the U.S. health regulator on Friday, marking the company's entry into a crowded market of medicines for a disease that affects about 39 million Americans. The drug, Trudhesa, can be self-administered to the bloodstream by being sprayed in the upper part of the nasal canal and is formulated using dihydroergotamine (DHE), an agent that works on the serotonin receptors linked to migraine. Impel will price the treatment between $600 and $850 for a pack containing four doses and is aiming for more than $500 million in peak sales, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Adams told Reuters. The Seattle-based company, which went public in April, plans to commercially launch Trudhesa in early October. Its rivals include Biohaven Pharmaceutical's (BHVN.N) Nurtec ODT and AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) Ubrelvy, both of which are orally administered. The market also has another intranasal DHE product, Migranal, whose commercial success has been held back by its less effective method of administration in the lower nasal cavity. Cowen & Co analysts said the Trudhesa's differentiated nasal delivery method should help it find a solid role in the treatment paradigm. Around 1 billion people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. ""We are taking this product to a population that wants DHE ... to be available in a consistent, predictable and trustworthy way,"" Impel's Adams said. The approval comes with a strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning that the treatment carries risks of potential impaired blood supply to the tissues when used together with certain enzyme inhibitors found in steroids.

Canada sees urgent need to get more young people vaccinated,1660,"OTTAWA/CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New modeling shows an ""urgent need"" to get more young adults in Canada vaccinated as the country fights a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant, the public health agency said on Friday. At the current rate of vaccination, new COVID-19 cases could surge past the peak of Canada's third wave and could exceed hospital capacity within months, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said. The modeling showed a need to speed up the overall rate of vaccinations, particularly for the 18-39 age group, to reduce the impact of the Delta resurgence, PHAC said in a presentation. ""The bottom line is that millions of people across Canada remain unvaccinated and at high risk of COVID-19 infections and severe illness outcomes,"" said Canada's chief public health officer Theresa Tam. The western province of Alberta said it will hand out C$100 ($79.96) gift cards as an incentive to encourage unvaccinated Albertans to get jabs. It is the first province in Canada to offer cash to boost vaccination uptake. Alberta has the lowest vaccination rate in Canada and leading the country in new COVID-19 cases, recording 1,339 new cases on Thursday. ""This is a crisis of the unvaccinated,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told a news conference on Friday. ""You are putting yourselves and our healthcare system at risk.""

"Early Canada election call backfires on Trudeau, who now trails in polls",3283,"MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself behind in polls ahead of a snap election he called hoping his management of the COVID-19 crisis would propel him to victory. Trudeau called the Sept. 20 election last month, two years ahead of schedule. At the time, his Liberals were well ahead and looked likely to regain the majority in parliament they lost in 2019. His main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, has repeatedly attacked him for calling a vote during the pandemic. The latest polls by Nanos, Ekos and others show Liberal fortunes have faded as voters have grown fatigued with Trudeau, 49, who has been in power since 2015. One Liberal strategist said on Friday the early-vote call had backfired as it was seen as ""wrong"" and ""greedy"" by electors. Also on Friday, Canadian health officials released modeling showing new COVID-19 cases could surpass the peak of the third wave within the month, and warned that if vaccinations among young adults do not ramp up, the country's hospital capacity may be exceeded. read more The Nanos Research survey for CTV put the Conservatives on 35.7% public support, with the Liberals on 30.7% and the smaller left-leaning New Democrats on 18.3%. An Ekos poll published late Thursday puts the Conservatives at 35.5% versus 30.7% for the Liberals.(See more polls: ) If these numbers hold up on election day, O'Toole would most likely win a minority administration. (See profiles of party leaders: read more ) On Thursday, the Conservative leader came out of a French-language leaders' debate without suffering much damage. During the exchanges, Trudeau said that if there were to be another minority government, there would most likely be another election in 18 months. read more ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interests,"" O'Toole told reporters on Friday. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that,"" he said after a campaign announcement in Montreal. On Friday, Trudeau said his debate comments referred to the average duration of minority governments. He then attacked O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates for domestic travel, saying the Conservative policy would put people in danger. ""Without strong leadership on vaccines, our kids won't be safe in the classroom, our businesses won't grow and thrive, and all Canadians will be at risk,"" Trudeau said. On Friday, Canadian health officials said there is an ""urgent need"" to ramp up vaccinations for 18- to 39-year-olds, who lag the rest of the population. They also said masking and social distancing must continue into the winter to prevent further spread. Some 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. Liberal strategists expressed hope their fortunes will improve if Canadians start paying more attention next week after Monday's Labor Day holiday and two more debates. During the last two election campaigns, Trudeau won crucial support late by telling Canadians a vote for the New Democrats - who compete for the same left-leaning segment of the electorate - would split progressives resulting in a Conservative government.

Payrolls and the stock market: Wall Street usually shrugs off jobs report,2559,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Markets always look to the Labor Department's monthly employment report with great anticipation. But whether the data disappoints or surprises to the upside often has only a modest effect on overall stock index moves. Friday's report missed consensus by a mile, for example, showing the economy added a paltry 235,000 jobs instead of the 728,000 expected by economists. But Wall Street seemed to largely shrug off the disappointment. The S&P 500 was essentially flat. ""Today it’s as simple as ‘bad news is good news’ because the weak number gives the Fed cover to maintain its dovish outlook and likely push back tapering,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. Detrick also pointed to strengthening yields as a reason the stock market is not terribly worried. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose about 4 basis points to 1.3257% Friday afternoon on data in the jobs report showing wages heating up even more than feared. Even so benchmark Treasury yields are well below the highs earlier this year when traders were most worried about the U.S. recovery kindling durable inflation. ""This was on the disappointing side of things, but the bond market isn’t overly concerned,"" Detrick added. ""If the bond market was worried about the economy, yields would be lower and that’s not the case."" The term ""Goldilocks"" is often used to describe data that hits the sweet spot; not so dire as to herald economic deterioration or so robust as to cause the Federal Reserve to tighten its dovish monetary policies. And as markets tend to prefer not to be surprised, it might stand to reason that stocks would perform well when the actual number comes in close to estimates. But neither appears to have been the case over the last year. The graphic below shows the monthly payrolls surprise against the movement of the S&P 500 (.SPX) on the day of the report's release: On a more granular level, a clearer picture emerges. This graphic charts payrolls surprise against the tech sector (.SPLRCT) which tends to respond well to disappointing economic data as it tends to ensure the Fed will keep key interest rates low, and Dow transports (.DJT) that is seen by many as a barometer of economic health: Finally, this graphic pits payrolls surprise against the rise and fall of benchmark Treasury yields, in basis points, during the session of the report.

Biden warns of 'unconstitutional chaos' due to Texas abortion ban,6134,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause ""unconstitutional chaos"" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday. The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because of an unusual feature that leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, who could collect cash bounties of at least $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against women who seek abortion after their sixth week of pregnancy or those who help them. Civil rights advocates warned that concept could cause havoc if it is adopted by other states or applied to other contentious rights, such as gun ownership. ""It unleashes unconstitutional chaos and empowers self-anointed enforcers to have devastating impacts,"" Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement directing federal agencies to act to protect the right to abortion enshrined in the high court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women."" By a 5-4 vote, the justices late on Wednesday denied an emergency request by abortion and women's health providers for an injunction on enforcement of the ban while litigation continues. The ban took effect early on Wednesday and prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. The law could still be blocked at some other stage. The law would amount to a near-total ban on the procedure in Texas - the second-most-populous U.S. state - as 85% to 90% of abortions are obtained after six weeks of pregnancy, and would probably force many clinics to close, abortion rights groups said. 'STUNNING' One of the court's six conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, joined its three liberals in dissent. ""The court's order is stunning,"" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. ""Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand."" In an unsigned explanation, the court's majority said the Texas law's unusual construction - leaving enforcement to individuals bringing lawsuits - limited its ability to act and that its decision was not a reflection of the ultimate constitutionality of the law. ""Federal courts enjoy the power to enjoin individuals tasked with enforcing laws, not the laws themselves,"" the court said. ""This order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts."" Pro-life supporter Josh Alcorn demonstrates in front of the Supreme Court after the Court upheld the first nationwide ban on a specific abortion procedure, in Washington, April 18, 2007. REUTERS/Jim Young (UNITED STATES) A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In a June survey, some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The Republican president of Florida's state Senate, Wilton Simpson, told local station WFLY-TV on Thursday that he planned to follow Texas' lead and bring up a similar abortion ban in the chamber's next session. ""This law will begin saving the lives of tens of thousands of Texas babies and we look forward to the day that babies’ lives will be spared across America,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee. Biden, a Roman Catholic who has shifted to the left on abortion in recent years, said the White House would look at what steps the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can take to respond to the Texas law. The Office of the White House Counsel and Biden's Gender Policy Council will also review the matter. POLARIZING ISSUE Abortion remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and most Republicans opposing them. The number of abortions reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped in recent decades, to roughly 620,000 in 2018, the most recent figures, down from 790,000 in 2009. Congress has the power to legalize abortion nationwide, and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the Texas law and vowed to take up a bill to do so when Congress returns later this month. ""Its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade, and even refuses to make exceptions for cases of rape and incest,"" Pelosi said. ""This ban necessitates codifying Roe v. Wade."" Democrats hold narrow majorities in Congress, but passage in the House would not guarantee success in the Senate, which requires 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. Democrats hold 50 seats in that chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote. The court decision illustrates the impact of Republican former President Donald Trump's three conservative appointees to the nation's highest court, who have tilted it further to the right. All were in the majority. A ban like Texas' has never been permitted in any state since the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states to ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, often at six weeks. Courts had previously blocked such bans, citing Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the coming months in a case centering on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, in which the state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK panel does not recommend COVID vaccines for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds,2799,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain's vaccine advisers said they were not recommending the vaccination of all 12- to 15-year-olds against COVID-19, preferring a precautionary approach in healthy children due to a rare side effect of heart inflammation. The advice could see Britain pursue a different approach to the United States, Israel and some European countries, which have rolled out vaccinations to children more broadly. However a final decision has not been taken, as the British government said it would consult medical advisers to look at other factors, such as disruption to schools. Many politicians and some scientists have spoken out in favour of vaccinating more children amid concern that COVID-19 could spread in schools that are re-opening after summer holidays, further disrupting education. Britain has reported more than 133,000 deaths from COVID-19 and nearly 7 million cases, and while transmission among children can be high, they are rarely severely ill from the disease. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday said children with underlying conditions that made them more at risk from COVID-19 should get vaccinated. For healthy children, there was still a small benefit from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and advisers said the risk-benefit was ""finely balanced"". However, the JCVI said it wanted more information on the long-term effects of rare reports of heart inflammation, known as myocarditis, in young people following vaccination with Pfizer's shot. Myocarditis is rare and normally mild, with patients usually recovering in a few days. read more ""Of course these vaccines do work and would be beneficial to children in terms of preventing infection and disease, but the number of serious cases that we see of COVID in children this age are really very small,"" JCVI member Adam Finn told Reuters. ""There are uncertainties about the long-term implications of (myocarditis), and that makes the risk-benefit balance for these children really quite tight and much tighter than we would be comfortable to make the recommendation."" UK health minister Sajid Javid, who sets policy for England, and his counterparts from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, wrote to the chief medical officers (CMOs) of the four nations, asking for further advice, ""including on educational impacts"". ""Given the importance of this issue, we would be grateful if you could provide your advice as soon as possible,"" the four health ministers said in a letter to the CMOs. The JCVI is also expected to advise on a potential booster vaccine programme for the elderly and vulnerable which could start this month. read more JCVI member Finn said there would be an update on boosters ""within the next few days.""

India restores mobile services in Kashmir two days after death of separatist leader,2057,"SRINAGAR, India, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mobile services in Indian Kashmir were restored late on Friday, two days after they were suspended following the death of a veteran secessionist leader in the disputed Himalayan region, a police official told Reuters. However, curbs on mobile internet and restrictions on the movement of people in the Kashmir valley would continue, police chief Vijay Kumar said. India tightened curbs on movement of people in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar and elsewhere, with scores of armed soldiers fanning out ahead of prayers on Friday, a day after Syed Ali Shah Geelani was laid to rest. Geelani, 91, died on Wednesday and was buried near his home in the city, where soldiers patrolled the streets to forestall any large-scale protests and gatherings at mosques. ""More troops have been deployed in sensitive areas and more roads have been barricaded,"" a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Despite the curfew there was violence in at least a dozen of places in Kashmir in which one paramilitary trooper was injured, the official said, adding that police had to use tear gas to disperse crowds. For years, Geelani, one of Kashmir's most senior political leaders, had led a hardline faction of separatist groups that sought to secede from India following an armed revolt against New Delhi. Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and arch rival Pakistan, which claim the region in full but rule only parts. Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was renewed in August 2019, when New Delhi scrapped the autonomy of its state of Jammu and Kashmir, splitting it into two federally administered territories.

"Japan's struggling PM Suga steps down, sets stage for new leader",5691,"TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in a surprise move on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for a new premier after a one-year tenure marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and sinking public support. Suga, who took over after Shinzo Abe resigned last September citing ill health, has seen his approval ratings drop below 30% as the nation struggles with its worst wave of COVID-19 infections ahead of a general election this year. Suga did not capitalise on his last major achievement - hosting the Olympics, which were postponed months before he took office as coronavirus cases surged. His decision not to seek reelection as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president this month means the party will choose a new leader, who will become prime minister. There is no clear frontrunner, but the popular minister in charge of Japan's vaccination rollout, Taro Kono, intends to run, broadcaster TBS said on Friday without citing sources. Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida has already thrown his hat in the ring. Before Abe's record eight-year tenure, Japan had gone through six prime ministers in as many years, including Abe's own troubled first one-year term. Tokyo stocks jumped on news of Suga's decision, with the benchmark Nikkei (.N225) rising 2% and the broader Topix (.TOPX) hitting its highest levels since 1991. ""I want to focus on coronavirus response, so I told the LDP executive meeting that I've decided not to run in the party leadership race,"" Suga told reporters. ""I judged that I cannot juggle both and I should concentrate on either of them."" He said he would hold a news conference as early as next week. Suga's abrupt resignation ended a rollercoaster week in which he pulled out all the stops to save his job, including suggestions he would sack his long-term party ally, as well as plans to dissolve parliament and reshuffle party executive and his cabinet. He is expected to stay on until his successor is chosen in the party election slated for Sept. 29. The winner, assured of being premier due to the LDP's majority in the lower house of parliament, must call the general election by Nov. 28. Suga has been an important ally for U.S. President Joe Biden in pushing back against China's increasingly assertive behavior and he was the first foreign leader Biden welcomed in person at the White House in April. read more A State Department spokesperson said Biden was grateful for Suga’s leadership and partnership on shared challenges, including COVID-19, climate change, North Korea, China, and preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ""The U.S.-Japan alliance is and will remain ironclad, not just between our governments, but our people,"" the spokesperson said. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to media after he annouced to pull out of a party leadership race at his official residence in Tokyo, Japan, September 3, 2021. Kyodo/via REUTERS Suga's departure will raise questions about the timing of an in-person summit of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia seen as a means to counter China that Washington has been looking to host this fall. read more RACE FOR LEADER Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said Kishida was the front runner for the moment, ""but that doesn't mean his victory is assured."" Nakano said Kono, Suga's administrative reform minister, could run if he gets the backing of his faction leader in the party, Finance Minister Taro Aso. Declaring himself a contender, Kishida, a soft-spoken Hiroshima lawmaker, on Thursday criticised Suga's coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic. Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba said he was ready to run if the conditions and environment are right. He was a rare LDP critic of Abe during his time as prime minister. Kono has led Japan's rocky inoculation drive, but remains high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga. Kono has stopped short of declaring his candidacy, telling reporters he wanted to carefully consult with party colleagues first. A former foreign and defence minister, Kono, 58, is popular with younger voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers - a rarity in Japanese politics dominated by older men who are less social media-savvy. Abe's stance will be closely watched given his influence inside the two largest factions of the LDP and among conservative MPs, experts say. The LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its lower house majority, but forecasts suggest the LDP could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever leads the party next. ""Stock prices are rising based on a view that the chance of LDP's defeat in the general election has diminished because anyone other than Suga will be able to regain popularity,"" said Toru Suehiro, a senior economist at Daiwa Securities. Suga's image as a shrewd political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74% when he took office. He initially won applause for populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments. But removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism. His delay in halting a domestic travel programme - which experts say may have helped spread coronavirus around Japan - hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses.

"Tyson Foods, unions strike deal over COVID-19 vaccine mandate",2573,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said on Friday that labor unions have agreed to support its requirement for U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by November, and the company will offer new benefits to workers including paid sick leave. Companies have been working to incentivize employees to get vaccinated through bonuses and other benefits as the highly contagious Delta variant drives an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. In some instances, employees who do not get shots face penalties like higher insurance costs. read more Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said on Aug. 3 that U.S. employees must get vaccinated, though the requirement for unionized plant workers was subject to negotiations. read more The company has now won support from the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represent more than 80% of Tyson's 31,000 unionized workers in the United States, it said in a statement. Tyson runs slaughterhouses in rural areas where some residents have been reluctant to get vaccinated. In Iowa, where Tyson operates pork plants, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to state data. Nationwide, 53% of the total population and 62% of people eligible for vaccines have been fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The UFCW, America's largest meatpacking union, said it secured 20 hours of paid sick leave per year for Tyson employees as part of negotiations over the mandate. It is the first national U.S. agreement to provide paid sick leave to meatpacking workers, the union said. All Tyson employees can begin earning the 20 hours starting on Jan. 1, the company said. The UFCW initially expressed concerns over the mandate because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not fully approved vaccines, instead granting approval for emergency use. Last week, the FDA granted full approval to Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE's shot. read more Tyson said more than 90,000 employees, or 75% of its U.S. workforce of 120,000, have received at least one dose of a vaccine, up from about 56,000 before the mandate. Some workers can be exempt from the mandate for religious or medical reasons, according to the UFCW."
"'They told us they hate Africans': Hundreds detained, deported from Abu Dhabi",5877,"BEIRUT, Sept 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kabirat Olokunde, a Nigerian migrant worker, planned to spend her birthday with friends in the city of Abu Dhabi. Instead, she turned 28 in a frigid prison cell, one of about 700 Africans imprisoned by Emirati authorities. In unparalleled mass arrests, the workers were jailed with ""no legal justification"" on the night of June 24-25, and later started being deported, said ImpACT International for Human Rights Policies and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor. ""I celebrated my birthday in chains, with no mattress,"" Olokunde said by phone from the Nigerian city of Lagos, where she was deported on Aug. 3 without access to her belongings. ""I still have the trauma in me,"" added the single mother, who is now jobless after working as a bus attendant and caretaker in Abu Dhabi, a regional trade and tourism hub that is part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In an Interior Ministry statement on Friday, the UAE said it had detained 376 men and women for offences related to human trafficking, ""extortion, assault, and acts contrary to public morality"". It said most of them were deported, but another 50 remained in prison due to a lack of travel documents. The Abu Dhabi government communications office and the Nigerian embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to requests for comment on the rights groups' report. Human rights groups have previously documented the imprisonment of hundreds of activists, academics and lawyers in the UAE, often following unfair trials on vague charges. The UAE has dismissed those accusations as false and unsubstantiated. RACIALLY MOTIVATED The UAE is home to nearly 10 million people, more than 80% of whom are expatriates who send remittances home to their families, according to the United Nations. Workers from developing countries often live in shared residencies in Abu Dhabi with separate wings for different nationalities, like La Gym, where Olokunde was arrested. African and Asian workers have highlighted stigmatisation and racism in the past, but the two rights groups said the June raid was a marked escalation. ""The scale of this racially motivated deportation is completely unprecedented,"" said Michela Pugliese, a migration researcher at Euro-Med Monitor. ""The victims and other migrants who aspire to work safely in the UAE have had this right unjustly revoked. Its consequences will be felt for years to come."" The investigation, based on interviews with more than 100 migrant workers, found that Abu Dhabi's Rapid Intervention Forces (SWAT), Criminal Investigation Department and police carried out mass arrests in at least four apartment buildings. The subsequent forced deportations were illegal, Pugliese said, as many of the workers had valid residency permits and work visas and were denied due process or access to their personal property. Friday's interior ministry statement said the deportations were conducted ""in accordance with legal procedures"" and with the knowledge of the workers' home countries. STUN GUNS Migrant workers told researchers that the arresting units used excessive force against them, including stun guns, and touched women's bodies inappropriately. Olokunde said she was arrested in shorts and a bra, and was not allowed to dress before being transported to the jail. When she and other women went on a hunger strike to demand justification for their arrest, they were chained for seven days, including her birthday, Olokunde said. Two workers who spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation said they slept on the floor in large, group cells, but were not given masks to protect against COVID-19 infection. In jail, the report said, detainees were denied access to health care and sanitary pads while women had their periods. The rights groups said detainees were not granted access to lawyers or told why they had been arrested - but some were indirectly accused of prostitution, which is a crime in the UAE. During her single, brief interrogation, Olokunde said she was asked, ""How much do you charge for a massage?"" SECRET CAMPAIGN According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), migrants are entitled to challenge their arrest in their country of residence. ""The abuses outlined demonstrate that migrants have had their rights to due process violated, and their detention conditions could amount to ill-treatment,"" said Rothna Begum, HRW's women's rights researcher in the Middle East. ""It is horrific that the UAE authorities appear to be conducting a secret campaign of mass arrests of African migrants, without any clear legal basis for such arrests or detention,"" she added. Kenneth Rubangakene, a 31-year-old Ugandan clerk who had lived in Abu Dhabi since 2017, also said he was taken from his La Gym apartment to prison. He said guards scanned his fingerprints and retinas without explanation, chained his hands and feet for three days, and imitated the sound of a couple having sex, asking if he had ever heard that noise at La Gym. ""They told us Africans are spoiling their country, they want to get rid of Africans from the street, we Africans are stupid,"" he said. He was deported from Dubai International Airport on July 29, according to a printed booking confirmation that Rubangakene shared with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which he said was given to him by prison guards. ""It was so shameful at the airport. You are arriving in a prison uniform, in prison sandals,"" he said. The Ugandan embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rubangakene said he has about 6,000 dirham ($1,634) stuck in a bank account in the UAE that he cannot access, as his bankcard - along with teaching certifications he would need to apply for new jobs - all remained in his room. ""I came back with nothing. I'm starting from zero,"" he said. ($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The city of 9 million people is targeting a phased reopening and the full vaccination of its citizens by the end of this year, according to the draft seen by Reuters, which has yet to be endorsed.

Ho Chi Minh City alone has recorded 241,110 coronavirus infections and 9,974 deaths, representing half of the country's cases and 80% of its fatalities. The vast majority of those have come in recent months, ending hopes that Vietnam could continue to achieve success it showed in 2020, when aggressive contact tracing and quaratining led to one of the world's best COVID-19 containment records. The ministry of health on Friday reported 14,922 coronavirus infections, a record daily increase, raising its caseload to 501,649 with 12,476 deaths.

The percentage of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 health concerns also remained largely unchanged during a period when coronavirus cases caused by the Delta variant shot up across the United States. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics figures were part of an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic.

PNC owes $107 mln for Allegiant’s ‘egregious’ breach of trust – 8th Circ,3753,"(Reuters) - A predecessor’s failure to safeguard trust assets against a massive fraud scheme involving pre-need funeral contracts will cost PNC Bank $107 million, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Monday. PNC, represented by Dowd Bennett, argued that the $100 million judgment should be reduced to $46 million and that all of the $7 million fee award should be erased because its predecessor, Allegiant Bank, also was an unwitting victim of the scam perpetrated between 1998 and 2004 by National Prearranged Services Inc (NPS) and two related insurance companies. Although Allegiant had not participated in the scheme, its failure to detect it was “an egregious breach of trust” that justified the 2019 award of compensatory and punitive damages to the receiver for NPS and several state life insurance guaranty associations, Circuit Judge Steven Colloton wrote for the panel. He was joined by Circuit Judges Roger Wollman and Bobby Shepherd. Daniel Reilly of Fennemore argued the appeal for the receiver, the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, and the state guaranty associations of Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Arkansas. He was unable to comment on the opinion late Monday. PNC’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pittsburgh-based bank acquired liability for Allegiant’s former trust services as part of its 2008 acquisition of National City Bank. A year earlier, Texas insurance regulators had appointed a receiver to liquidate NPS and two Texas-based insurers, Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance and Memorial Service Life Insurance Company. Like NPS, both insurers were owned by James “Doug” Cassity or his family. NPS had ostensibly complied with Missouri law by purchasing life insurance policies to cover its obligations to the pre-need contract holders and placing them in seven trusts at Allegiant Bank. However, NPS would frequently “mismatch” policies, creating a Ponzi-like scheme in which new contracts were used to pay for services under older ones. The insurers also allowed NPS to borrow against the value of the policies, depleting their value. The policy loans required a sign-off by Allegiant, but the companies never requested Allegiant’s approval, and Allegiant never caught the omission. The receiver and the guaranty associations filed suit in U.S. District Court in St. Louis in 2009, while federal prosecutors brought criminal fraud charges against Cassity and other individuals in 2010. The prosecution ended with several guilty pleas and one conviction in 2013. The civil suit went to a jury trial in 2015. The 8th Circuit tossed the $391 million verdict in 2017, saying the case should have been tried to a judge. On remand, Senior U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber awarded $72 million in compensatory damages, $15 million in punitive damages and $12 million in prejudgment interest, plus attorneys’ fees. PNC argued that the award should have been limited to compensatory damages only, and that Webber had miscalculated the amount. Among other things, it said, Allegiant was not responsible for $13 million in policy-loan losses, and any losses in some trust accounts should have been reduced by $11 million in gains in other accounts. “We conclude that none of PNC’s arguments establishes reversible error, and therefore affirm the judgment,” the 8th Circuit held. The case is Jo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., Special Deputy Receiver, et al. v. National City Bank and PNC Bank, N.A., 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 19-2554.

The settlement, announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice, resolves a 2015 whistleblower lawsuit brought under the federal False Claims Act by Kathy Ormsby, a former employee of Sutter affiliate Palo Alto Medical Foundation, in San Francisco federal court. According to Ormsby's attorneys, it is the largest settlement of an FCA case against a hospital system over alleged Medicare Advantage fraud, and the second-largest Medicare Advantage fraud settlement ever reported overall. ""This case is an important example of whistleblowers and their lawyers partnering with the government to bring extra expertise and legal firepower to the fight against fraud,"" Mark Kleiman of Kleiman Rajaram, one of the lawyers, said in a statement. ""Today's result sends a clear message that we will hold healthcare providers responsible if they knowingly provide or fail to correct information that is untruthful,"" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. Sutter, which is represented by Katherine Lauer and Amy Hargreaves of Latham & Watkins, said the deal brings ""closure to a long-running dispute, allowing Sutter to avoid the uncertainty and further expense of protracted litigation."" Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is a program under which patients enroll in privately run managed-care plans to receive benefits. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays those plans a fixed amount per patient adjusted for the patients' individual risk factors, which is determined based on diagnosis codes submitted by providers. For example, diagnoses of diabetes or congestive heart failure would result in higher payments. Ormsby and the government alleged that, beginning around 2010, Sutter knowingly submitted unsupported diagnosis codes for some patients, leading to inflated payments, and did not take sufficient corrective action after becoming aware of the unsupported codes. In addition to the payment, the settlement includes a five-year corporate integrity agreement under which Sutter must institute a centralized risk assessment program and hire an outside organization to review a sample of its patient diagnostic data each year. Ormsby is expected to get 15% to 30% of the settlement under the FCA, though the exact share has not yet been determined.

U.S. economy's hot vax summer ends in cool COVID fall as Delta rises,6634,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The promise of a ""normal"" U.S. economy this summer, which kicked off with the June revival of restaurants, air travel and baseball games, is transforming into an uncertain fall of rising health and economic risks. Labor Day weekend, the traditional end of the U.S. summer season, was pegged as the moment when the economy would finally transition out of the pandemic slump, with private sector jobs and wages replacing unemployment benefits. Instead, the summer is closing with rising COVID-19 case counts, hospitals bulging with patients, a sharp slowdown in jobs and dark predictions. Most startling - the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that between now and Dec. 1 there will be 100,000 COVID deaths, more than in the same period last year, when a wave of winter infections took hold and vaccines were not yet available. ""I don't think fall 2021 is going to give us the catharsis we were waiting for,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for hiring site Indeed, or provide a clear view of how fast U.S. job markets can recover the 5.3 million jobs missing from before the pandemic. ""The transition is going to be longer than expected. The issue is, is it a stumble or does the baton get dropped?"" Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 jobs last month after surging 1.053 million in July, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists had expected 728,000 new jobs. read more Special $300-per-week unemployment benefits end on Saturday. While employers hope that will usher new job applicants into a labor-starved market, there are signs the pandemic may have begun to curb their hiring plans instead. read more The reopening of schools, far from smoothing the way for parents to return to full-time jobs, has been marked by erratic outbreaks, quarantines and closures, as school boards battle over masking students. The manager at The Irish Whisper, a pub near the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Maryland, said that business has fallen off since an initial summertime rush. ""It's not as great as pre-COVID, but it's better than not having anything,"" said the manager, who only gave his first name Andrew. ""I thought we were in the clear and then this variant emerged."" After a strong start early this summer, attendance is dropping in baseball stadiums. BIDEN'S VIRUS OVERSHADOWED It is a particularly sensitive moment for U.S. President Joe Biden. The Democratic president has taken a hit in the polls from the resurgent virus, faces criticism over the Afghanistan withdrawal and must deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida and a gauntlet of deadlines in Congress in coming weeks to keep the government funded and his economic agenda on track. ""There's a lot more work to do,"" to fix the U.S economy, Biden said Friday, addressing the weak jobs numbers. """"We need to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant,"" he said, repeating that it was a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Biden's strategy of wiping out COVID by getting all of the United States vaccinated was hindered by a politically charged anti-vaccination movement this summer, and the pace of vaccinations has slowed since peaking in April. A run of higher-than-expected inflation due to supply chain woes and labor shortages consumed what would otherwise have been healthy wage gains. A closely watched index of consumer confidence, which can influence spending, tumbled in August to a six-month low. Progress on the virus ""is (Biden's) No. 1 advantage, but people are discouraged and frustrated and it's also interacting with the economy,"" said one Biden adviser not authorized to speak on the record. Administration officials believe the recovery largely remains on track, and infrastructure and spending plans may partly make up for the lapsed weekly unemployment insurance payments. Democrats are hoping to finalize a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill as soon as this month while also working on a $3.5 trillion bill that could only secure party-line support. ""This bill is going to end years of gridlock,"" Biden said of the smaller infrastructure bill. ""Both literally and figuratively it's going to change things,"" he said. Republicans are fighting the administration's most ambitious spending plans. Goldman Sachs economists now estimate the ""fiscal cliff,"" as spending rotates away from the record government transfers of the past 18 months, will be a noticeable drag on growth by late 2022. Oxford Economics economists expect to trim their outlook for 2021 gross domestic product growth to 5.5%, down from 7% in early August. The reduction reflects ""the deteriorating health situation weighing on optimism and spending, lingering capital and labor supply constraints and a slower inventory rebuild,"" Oxford chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco said in an email. DELTA WEIGHS ON HIRING The August jobs data released Friday showed the current surge of infections, which drove the number of new cases from around 11,000 a day in mid-June to almost 150,000 daily this week, slowed hiring and the broader recovery. ""Today’s report has the Delta variant written all over it,"" Indeed's Bunker said. ""It is clear that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases is a strong headwind to the labor market."" Economists are not expecting the sort of collapse in demand for restaurants, travel and other services seen in earlier virus waves. Many Federal Reserve officials feel businesses and families have learned to navigate the situation, either finding ways to lower the risk of infection as they resume work and business, or worrying less about infection because they're vaccinated. The disappointing 235,000 in new jobs comes as the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July. It has, however, been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Some employers argue that job growth figures could be much higher, given the record number of openings, if they had not had to compete with unemployment benefits. That hasn't been borne out in states that ended the federal benefits early over the summer, where there's little evidence more people went back to work. Instead, employers seem to be pulling back on hiring themselves. Hiring at around 50,000 small businesses has fallen since midsummer, data from time manager Homebase shows, while a workforce recovery index from time management firm UKG, which analyzes time card punches, fell 2.4% from July to August. It was sharpest in the southeast, where the spread of the virus was most intense. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Tunisia's powerful union calls to change political system,1632,"TUNIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tunisia's powerful labour union on Friday called on the president to propose changes to the political system and put them to a referendum after his seizure of governing powers in July in a move critics called a coup. The UGTT union, which has so far backed President Kais Saied since he sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and said he was taking over executive authority, has for weeks urged him to name a government and announce a roadmap for the crisis. On Friday, its leader Noureddine Taboubi, also indicated it would back changes to the constitution and political system, blaming them for the gridlock that preceded Saied's intervention on July 25. ""The main problem in Tunisia is the political and constitutional system that has crippled everything and left no way for progress,"" he told reporters, adding that any changes must be put to a referendum. The president's actions appear to have widespread support after years of economic stagnation and political paralysis. However, Saied's delay in appointing a new government or announcing his longer-term plans has caused jitters among some Tunisians fearing a lack of direction in the face of major economic challenges or even a return to autocracy. The president has rejected that, saying his actions were lawful and that rights will be upheld, and dismissing concerns over the lack of clarity about his next steps. ""We demand the speedy formation of the government to resolve urgent files such as unemployment, education, health, and the economic and social situation,"" Taboubi said.

"U.S. accuses UPMC, leading surgeon of billing fraud",3738,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The federal government has accused the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the head of its cardiothoracic surgery department of fraudulently billing Medicare and Medicaid for complex surgeries. The complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, claims that UPMC has regularly allowed James Luketich to book as many as three complex surgeries at the same time, going back and forth between patients and not participating in key parts of the surgeries, while keeping patients under unnecessary anesthesia. The government alleges Luketich and UPMC violated laws and regulations that they say prevent physicians like Luketich, who perform teaching duties within a medical school or residency program, from billing federal health insurance programs for such surgeries. It also alleges that the practice harmed patients. ""The laws prohibiting 'concurrent surgeries' are in place for a reason: to protect patients and ensure they receive appropriate and focused medical care,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Kaufman of the Western District of Pennsylvania said in a statement. ""Our office will take decisive action against any medical providers who violate those laws, and risk harm to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries."" ""Dr. Luketich is confident that (the allegations) are wholly incorrect, and we will vigorously defend against them,"" Luketich's lawyer, Efrem Grail of The Grail Law Firm, said in an email. ""Dr. Luketich enjoys a stellar reputation as a surgeon, as a person of integrity and as a doctor who cares."" UPMC spokesperson Paul Wood said that the case was based in a ""misapplication or misinterpretation"" of federal guidance, and that performing and billing for overlapping surgeries is not fraudulent. The case began with a 2019 whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former UPMC doctor, Jonathan D'Cunha. The government exercised its power to intervene in the case under the False Claims Act. The government alleged that, in addition to resulting in hundreds of fraudulent bills to government health insurance programs, Luketich's practices have resulted in serious harm to patients by extending their surgeries and time under anesthesia, increasing the risk of complications. In January 2015, Jonas Johnson, the head of UPMC's Surgical Services Oversight Committee reprimanded Luketich following an incident in which he left a patient under anesthesia and could not be found for an hour, according to the complaint. Later that year, Johnson again warned Luketich that he could only provide services to one Medicare patient at a time, the complaint said. Nonetheless, according to the complaint, Luketich continued to schedule and perform concurrent surgeries. Luketich is one of UPMC's highest sources of revenue, the government said, bringing in tens of millions of dollars per year. It is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

Giant Eagle loses bid to escape Ohio opioid claims,4240,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Supermarket and pharmacy chain Giant Eagle has lost a bid to escape claims by two Ohio counties that it fueled opioid addiction by ignoring red flags that prescriptions were being used for illegal sales. The order Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, means Giant Eagle will face trial next month alongside Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc. Rite Aid Corp, which had also been a defendant in the case, recently settled. The trial will serve as a bellwether to test public nuisance claims against pharmacies in the sprawling multidistrict litigation over opioids. ""Giant Eagle is committed to responsible pharmacy operations and dedicated to serving our communities ... in each of the five states in which we operate,"" Dan Donovan, a spokesperson for Giant Eagle, which is represented by Robert Barnes of Marcus & Shapira. ""We look forward to detailing our record of compliance with state and federal laws and regulations at trial."" Frank Gallucci of Plevin & Gallucci, a lawyer for plaintiffs Lake and Trumbull Counties, declined to comment. The retailer had argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Ohio Board of Pharmacy had repeatedly inspected its facilities and found it in compliance with applicable laws, including the Controlled Substances Act. That law requires pharmacies to have procedures in place to prevent the diversion of prescription drugs, including opioids, into illegal channels, including a system for reporting suspicious orders. Polster, however, said the counties had presented ""extensive evidence"" of possible violations of anti-diversion laws that inspectors did not find, but that Giant Eagle knew about. That evidence included expert testimony that pharmacists repeatedly filled ""obvious 'red flag'"" prescriptions and documented instances of diversion in the two counties linked to Giant Eagles' prescriptions, he said. The judge also noted that the counties alleged that the inspections were ""limited in scope"" and could not necessarily uncover all violations. While Giant Eagle did not have to show perfect compliance with the law to avoid a public nuisance claim, the judge said, the extent to which it complied was ""best left to a jury."" More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by local governments around the country accusing drugmakers of falsely marketing opioids as safe and pharmacies and distributors of shirking their duty to monitor and report suspicious prescriptions and orders. The nation's three largest distributors and Johnson & Johnson have offered to pay up to $26 billion to settle cases against them, though it is not yet clear which states will opt into that deal. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP has won approval for a bankruptcy plan that will resolve claims against it. Major pharmacy chains, however, have yet to propose a nationwide settlement. The opioid crisis has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the last two decades. The cases are County of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45032, and County of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45079, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

Life insurers shift to pre-pandemic norms after COVID vaccine roll-outs,5108,"LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations is making life insurers more enthusiastic about offering cover to those with underlying health conditions - some without even knowing whether customers have been vaccinated. Life insurers were imposing waiting periods to buy cover in the early stages of the pandemic for certain age groups, as well as for those who had been infected, saying the long-term health consequences of coronavirus were not fully understood. read more But now that vaccines are prevalent in major economies such as Britain and the United States, life insurers see fewer risks. Helen Croft, head of underwriting strategy at AIG Life (AIG.N), said the insurer had previously been more cautious in offering cover as a result of the pandemic, but the efficacy and widespread use of the vaccine meant it could provide insurance for more customers. ""The vaccine take-up has been excellent,"" she said. AIG Life did not check if individual customers have been vaccinated, with Croft pointing out the insurer did not ask customers about other inoculations, such as for flu. ""I don't think it's necessary to be asking about the vaccine - the population level take-up gives us enough comfort,"" she said. Insurers such as LV=, Aviva (AV.L) and Zurich (ZURN.S) also said they did not ask vaccination questions, with Zurich highlighting the possible limitations of inoculation, such as long-term effectiveness or the impact of new variants. Regardless of vaccination status, customers with underlying health conditions may pay up to five times the standard rate for life insurance products, sources said. A reduction in the hospitalisation and death rate as a result of vaccination has meant that ""almost all"" insurers in Britain have reversed previous COVID-19 restrictions on life cover, said Phil Jeynes, director of corporate sales at insurance broker Reassured. Britain was one of the first countries to roll out a vaccination programme and almost 80% of all over-16s are fully vaccinated, according to UK government figures. Premiums have stayed much the same during the pandemic, Jeynes added. Rather than raising rates, insurers postponed providing cover for those above a certain age, with some underlying health conditions or who were recovering from COVID-19, industry sources said. Life insurance premium volumes dropped by 11% in Britain and by 0.1% in the United States in 2020, according to Swiss Re. Sharp falls in household incomes due to lockdowns and job losses hit demand for life insurance last year, the reinsurer said in a recent report. Swiss Re expects strong life insurance growth this year and next due to the economic recovery and increased consumer awareness of risk. In the United States, where more than half of the population is vaccinated, major life insurers Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Lincoln (LNC.N) told Reuters they did not ask about vaccines. The Insurance Compact, standards adopted by 47 U.S. states, said it did not currently allow insurers to ask vaccination questions as state insurance regulation has not yet set public policy around the vaccine and underwriting. ASKING QUESTIONS However, some insurers in Britain are asking customers whether they have been inoculated, particularly if their health condition makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19, and this could affect the cost or size of their cover. ""For those that have been fully vaccinated, our risk appetite will be higher,"" said Rose St Louis, protection director at Scottish Widows. ""We may be able to offer improved terms to those who have had both vaccines."" Legal & General (LGEN.L) typically imposes a 12-month waiting period on customers who are clinically vulnerable and where the impact of COVID-19 may be life-threatening. ""To avoid postponing applications for this 1% of new customers, we will now ask whether or not they have had their required vaccine doses...allowing us to give cover to customers when it would otherwise not be available,"" an L&G spokesperson said by email. Unvaccinated vulnerable customers would be declined cover for now, though allowances would be made for those who could not have the shot for medical reasons such as pregnancy, L&G said. Insurers need to get clearance from their reinsurers for any underwriting changes they make, as reinsurers may otherwise be unwilling to provide that cover. L&G said its reinsurers agreed with its approach, without naming them. One global reinsurer, who declined to be identified, said it was supporting the stance of ""several insurers"" in Britain who were insuring customers in higher risk medical groups for larger amounts of cover, if the customers provided evidence that they were fully vaccinated. Clive Allison, director, life and pensions at consultants EY, said the need for vaccine questions may be short-lived. ""There'll be a convergence where most adults will have been double-vaccinated,"" he said. ""The ones that haven't are most likely to be in the younger age bracket, and typically are not looking to take out insurance cover."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Britain distributing COVID-19 vaccines to climate talks delegates,1382,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain has started shipping COVID-19 vaccines to delegates attending global climate talks it is hosting next month who cannot access them at home, with the first shots to be delivered next week. The COP26 conference, postponed from last year, takes place from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow. Typically delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, but with many countries still grappling with the novel coronavirus, climate and health experts have said poorer nations struggling to access COVID-19 vaccines could find sending delegates difficult. ""Vaccines are shipping and vaccination will begin next week and through mid-September before second jabs in October well ahead of COP26,"" British COP26 envoy John Murton said on Twitter on Friday.

"Air quality improved slightly in 2020 during lockdowns, U.N. agency says",1984,"GENEVA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Key air pollutants temporarily plunged by unprecedented levels during coronavirus lockdowns last year, with fine particle pollution falling by more than a third across parts of Asia, a U.N. agency said on Friday. Particulate matter (PM 2.5) fell by up to 40% across Africa, South America and Southern Asia and by smaller amounts in parts of Europe and North America, the World Meteorological Organization said in its inaugural Air Quality and Climate Bulletin. It said COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions led to a ""dramatic short-lived fall in emissions"" of key air pollutants, especially in urban areas. ""During episodes when there were lockdown measures the air quality in many parts of the world has substantially improved and the improvement was largely on the side of particles,"" said Oksana Tarasova, head of the organization's atmospheric environment research division. The WMO bulletin, which compared 2020 air quality with 2015-2019 readings, showed that levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide emitted from the burning of fuel fell nearly everywhere and by as much as 70%. Air pollution is the single greatest environmental risk factor for premature deaths globally. It is likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40% of Indians by more than nine years, a report showed this week. read more The decline in pollutants last year was too short-lived to have an impact on health, Tarasova said. She cited events such as wildfires in Australia, smoke from biomass burning in Siberia and the United States, and the ""Godzilla effect"" of sand and dust drifting from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic to North America as adversely impacting air quality. The WMO bulletin also showed that ozone concentrations which can damage and inflame airways actually increased in some places last year. Tarasova said this was linked to lower nitrogen oxide levels which usually destroy the harmful gases. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The shipments include 250,320 doses of the Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine for the Democratic Republic of Congo, 657,080 Moderna doses for Uganda, 302,400 doses of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine for Guinea; and 35,100 doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE) for Seychelles. The doses are being delivered through COVAX, jointly run by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Africa has lagged sharply behind other regions in vaccinating its citizens, with most countries reporting single-digit vaccination rates, compared with much higher double-digit rates in advanced economies such as the United States.

South African health minister says C.1.2 variant not a threat for now,2268,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla said on Friday that scientists had told the government that at this stage the C.1.2 coronavirus variant detected locally was not a threat. The C.1.2 variant was first identified in May and has now been seen in all of the country's nine provinces. It contains some mutations associated in other variants with increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, leading researchers to flag its detection to the government and the World Health Organization (WHO). read more ""At this stage they (scientists) have assured us it's not really a threat, they are just watching it,"" Phaahla told a news conference, noting C.1.2 had only been detected in small numbers so far. He added that it was almost certain that the country would face a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections around the end of the year. The WHO this week designated the C.1.2 variant as one for further monitoring, a category that reflects that it may pose a future risk but that the evidence is currently unclear. It has not been designated as a ""variant of interest"" or ""variant of concern,"" categories considered more serious and notated by letters of the Greek alphabet. South African researchers are currently running laboratory tests on how C.1.2 responds to antibodies generated by vaccines or prior infection, but it could be weeks before those results are out. Genomic sequencing data from South Africa this week showed that C.1.2 accounted for 2.4% of genomes sequenced in August, versus 2.5% in July and 1.2% in June. The Delta variant accounted for roughly 95% of sequences in August. Delta is the fastest spreading variant the world has encountered so far, and it is upending assumptions about COVID-19 even as nations loosen restrictions and reopen their economies. read more South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, one of only four currently labelled a variant of concern by the WHO. Beta is believed to spread more easily than the original version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and there is evidence vaccines work less well against it, leading some countries to restrict travel to and from South Africa.

Review: Covid-19 and the crises yet to come,5297,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - What are the lessons of the coronavirus pandemic? It may seem far too early to be asking that question. After all, Covid-19 is far from over. Around 100,000 Americans are in hospital with the virus. Countries like Australia are still effectively cut off from the rest of the world. And large swathes of the globe have barely begun vaccinating their populations. Even so, the historian Adam Tooze makes a strong case for looking back, and beginning to draw some conclusions. In “Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World’s Economy”, the Columbia University professor recaps the timeline of 2020, surely one of the most seismic years in global history. His focus is the period that started with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s public acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak on Jan. 20, 2020, and ended with U.S. President Joe Biden’s inauguration exactly a year later. The scale and variety of what unfolded in the intervening days remains dizzying. Tooze lucidly organises these events in the book’s 300 pages, while maintaining the sweeping perspective that will be familiar to readers of “Crashed”, his magisterial history of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. The story throws up multiple paradoxes. Covid-19 was a massive failure of public policy which also prompted governments to prop up their economies with unprecedented speed and decisiveness. It was a public health catastrophe that spurred breakthroughs in life-saving vaccines. In the United States the pandemic exacerbated already deep political divisions, culminating in the contested presidential election, yet also produced the world’s largest fiscal stimulus. Confronting the crisis forced governments to discard old orthodoxies, many of which were already under attack. Politicians who had previously sought to rein in public spending deployed vast sums to support citizens stuck at home and businesses which had been forced to close. Central banks hoovered up government bonds and backstopped a range of financial markets. Commitments to free trade and private enterprise were discarded in the rush to secure face masks and vaccines, and support crisis-struck industries. These extraordinary actions were largely designed to preserve the status quo. “None of the politicians who voted for huge spending had started the year planning to change society,” Tooze writes. And in some cases the sums were far too small. Compare the developed world’s meagre contributions to vaccines for poorer countries with the much larger economic gains that would have flowed from ending the pandemic around the world. Nevertheless, it’s hard to see the political pendulum returning to overly disciplined public spending, or a hands-off approach to private enterprise. This opens up intriguing possibilities, like a large-scale and state-directed investment drive to reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels. Despite years of warnings and several near misses, the world failed to adequately prepare for a global pandemic. Perhaps it can now avoid making the same mistake when it comes to climate change? Yet Covid-19 has also exposed many shortcomings. The virus “delivered a staggering demonstration of the collective inability of the global elite to grasp what it would actually mean to govern the deeply globalized and interconnected world they have created,” Tooze writes. If anything, the deterioration of relations between China and the United States over the past year and a half makes joined-up decision-making even less likely in future. Tooze does identify some pockets of strength. The rapid development, testing and deployment of vaccines is a testament to what scientists and governments can do when confronted with an urgent crisis. Central banks, too, successfully cushioned the impact of a massive global supply shock. These technocratic interventions have the unfortunate side effect of adding to inequality inside and between countries. The challenge for politicians is to counter those effects. The history of the past decade is not encouraging in this regard. Yet the world is bound to face bigger and longer global emergencies. The unprecedented floods in Europe, China and the United States this summer are surely just a taster for a time when weather fluctuations become wilder and harder to predict. It’s less likely climate change will knock a tenth off global GDP in short order, as the pandemic did in the second quarter of last year. But future crises are on the way. The history of Covid-19 so far suggests we still have many lessons to learn.

AstraZeneca reaches settlement with EU on COVID-19 vaccine delivery,4246,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and the European Commission have reached a settlement on the delivery of 200 million pending COVID-19 vaccine doses by the drugmaker, ending a row about shortages that had weighed on the company and the region's vaccination campaign. The dispute plunged the European Union into crisis earlier this year as states, under pressure to speed up vaccinations, scrambled for shots. It also caused a public relations crisis for AstraZeneca, which is led by Frenchman Pascal Soriot. Having reduced its initial reliance on the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, Brussels said parts of the volumes committed under the deal would be transferred outside the EU to ease global vaccine inequality. The bloc's vaccine supplies now come mainly from Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE). As part of Friday's settlement, AstraZeneca has committed to deliver 60 million doses of its vaccine, Vaxzevria, by the end of the third quarter this year, 75 million by the end of the fourth quarter and 65 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. When including deliveries already made, that schedule maps out the honouring of a 300 million dose bulk purchasing contract struck about a year ago between the company and the EU, after months of conflict over delays. The European Commission launched legal action against AstraZeneca in April for not respecting that contract and for not having a ""reliable"" plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU's executive body said that under the new agreement, member states would be provided with regular delivery schedules and if there were any delayed doses, capped rebates would be applied. EU members with low inoculation rates would be prioritised, it added. VACCINATION RATES Vial labelled ""AstraZeneca coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine"" placed on displayed EU flag is seen in this illustration picture taken March 24, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration ""There are significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial,"" said EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. She also said some deliveries under the settlement would go to lower-income countries outside the EU. ""We will continue helping the rest of the world. Our aim is to share at least 200 million doses of vaccines through COVAX with low and middle-income countries until the end of this year,"" she said, referring to vaccine-sharing facility run by the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization. The European Commission has caught up with its campaign schedule, saying this week that 70% of the European Union's adult population had been fully vaccinated, hitting a target set at the beginning of the year. read more The settlement allows for distribution while the highly-contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is causing a spike in cases and vaccines are being studied for longevity of protection. The EU's vaccine needs have for the most part been served by Pfizer and BioNTech because the partners have managed to ramp up production for ample supplies. Concerns over very rare cases of serious blood clotting linked to the Astra shot, co-developed with Oxford University, have weighed on demand for it. Use of the Astra shot in the region fell further when Germany decided in July that recipients of an initial Astra shot would complete their two-shot regimen with a dose of Pfizer or Moderna. ""I'm very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding which allows us to move forward and work in collaboration with the European Commission to help overcome the pandemic,"" said AstraZeneca senior executive Ruud Dobber. About 92 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine have been distributed to EU member states so far, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. That is far below the 437 million doses delivered by Pfizer/BioNTech but ahead of the 77 million Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine doses delivered. Astra said it had released more than 140 million doses to date at no profit to the EU, including doses that have yet to be delivered to member states and EU consignments to COVAX or to other non-EU states.

Supply shortages sap strength of euro zone recovery,2822,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity remained strong last month, despite fears about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and widespread supply chain issues, according to a survey which suggested the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end. IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 59.0 last month from July's 15-year high of 60.2, still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction but below a 59.5 ""flash"" estimate. ""Growth momentum in the euro zone is fading according to recent surveys and nowcast indicators. The big question is whether the recovery can carry on at a decent pace and quickly close the gap with pre-pandemic GDP,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. The economy will grow 2.2% this quarter, a Reuters poll published earlier on Friday predicted and IHS Markit said the euro zone economy was on track to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, if not sooner. But ongoing supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant the cost of raw materials soared again this month. The input prices index was a near record 69.5 - although down from July's 69.9. Inflation surged to a ten-year high of 3.0% in August with further rises likely, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase. read more Still, with much of the service industry reopening after the lifting of many restrictions its PMI remained well above breakeven at 59.0, albeit below July's 59.8 which was the highest reading since June 2006. Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at a strong pace as businesses which had been hit by coronavirus lockdowns catered for pent-up demand, although staff shortages and costs pressures put a dent in France's growth. read more Italy's services industry recorded another month of steep growth, sustaining hopes of a strong economic rebound, and in Spain the sector expanded for the fifth month in a row as more COVID-19 travel restrictions were phased out. In Britain, outside the common currency union, the recovery lost more momentum than originally estimated as staff shortages and supply chain issues weighed on companies in the country's huge services sector. Meanwhile, euro zone retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, were much weaker than expected in July, pulled down mainly by a sharp fall in the number of goods bought online, official date showed. read more Fears lockdown measures could be re-imposed have also put a dent in optimism. The euro zone services business expectations index in the PMI survey dipped to a four-month low of 68.9 from 69.1. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"China faces difficulties in expanding COVID-19 vaccination drive, official says",1731,"BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China is facing growing difficulties in expanding its mass COVID-19 vaccination drive, but it will continue to inoculate more people and step up the programme of booster shots, a health official said on Friday. Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission, did not specify the obstacles but stressed that those who have not been vaccinated could not rely on being protected by those who have had the shots amid concerns over the highly transmissible Delta variant. ""Recently, as (pushing vaccination work) came to the later stage, it has become increasingly difficult,"" Zheng said at a health forum. He said China has given full doses to about 900 million people, or more than 60% of its 1.4 billion population, but cited some experts saying China may need a vaccination rate higher than 80%. China administered around 13 million doses per day on average in July and August, slower than June's daily average of 19 million. By the end of October, the country is expected to complete giving regular regimen doses to 1.1 billion people as well as giving booster shots to limited groups such as the elderly and high-risk employees, according to estimates in Zheng's presentation. Currently people are recommended to take booster doses of the same type of technology as their first vaccinations, but more options might be available once studies on using different shots as boosters yield results, Zheng said. China has supplied 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the rest of the world, Zheng said. President Xi Jinping said in August that China would strive to provide 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries in 2021. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Are COVID boosters needed? FDA vaccine advisers wrestle with a thorny issue,4100,"CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to discuss two key questions when they meet on Sept. 17 to consider a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign this fall: Is protection from the initial shots waning, and will boosters help? The debate will likely be heated following the Biden Administration's announcement last month - before the experts could weigh in - that the U.S. plans to start booster doses Sept. 20 if regulators approve them. The White House move usurped the normal process in which the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make these sort of science-based decisions, according to interviews with six current and former FDA scientists and CDC advisory panel members. On Wednesday, the FDA set the meeting date to consider a third booster shot of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE vaccine and may discuss others. Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) submitted data to the FDA for consideration of its booster and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) last week said it was in discussions with the agency about one. read more ""The recommendation shouldn't precede the data, which is what happened here. And that's why people are so upset,"" said a source close to the FDA advisory panel who was not authorized to speak on the record. These experts took the FDA's decision to hold an advisory panel meeting on boosters as a promising sign that their opinions will be heeded, but said a favorable outcome is not guaranteed. Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University in Washington and a former chief scientist at the FDA, said the agency will need to go through all the relevant data before Sept. 17 to be ready for the panel meeting. ""We need to see that there is a meaningful boost in antibody levels and there are no red flags,"" he said. That will be challenging given that scientists still do not agree on the level of antibodies in the blood that predict vaccine protection, said Norman Baylor, chief executive of Biologics Consulting and former director of FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review. Much of the drug company argument in favor of boosters hinges on data that show antibodies wane over time and that another shot increases them. ""One of the things that committee members have to struggle with is ... what does this mean?"" Baylor said. ""You see an increase, but is that increase sufficient? And for how long?"" 'SHOW THE DATA' A fierce debate is expected around whether most Americans should get another shot rather than just those at high risk of severe illness, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose. ""You've got to show the data - show me that you're solving an important public health problem,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, a former FDA vaccine advisory panel member and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. The issue, according to Poland and others, is that the current crop of vaccines were designed to prevent hospitalization and death, which the CDC says they continue to do. The Biden Administration has taken a cue from Israel, where early data shows that a booster campaign appears to be lowering transmission of the virulent Delta variant, which has begun to cause mostly asymptomatic and mild infections in fully vaccinated people. Boosters would increase antibody levels, which fight infections. But immune memory from other components of the immune system is what offers protection from severe disease and hospitalization, and that can last for years. ""No matter how many booster doses you give, you cannot convert a disease-blocking vaccine into an infection-blocking vaccine,"" Poland said. Whatever the United States decides will likely influence decisions about boosters in other parts of the world, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""I think you'll probably see a trend in high-income countries to boost if the FDA grants them,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Privacy alarm in Indonesia over president's leaked vaccine certificate,2347,"JAKARTA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A leak online of the president's COVID-19 vaccine certificate has heightened concern in Indonesia about information security, coming in the same week as a data breach affecting 1.3 million users of a government contact-tracing application President Joko Widodo's vaccine records were accessed using the app, PeduliLindungi (care protect), and shared widely on social media, raising questions among experts about the government's commitment to data security. Digital analyst Ismail Fahmi said the leak showed how easy it was to view or potentially use another individual's vaccination certificate, even that of a head of state. ""If there was protection, there would be an investigation into why this problem persists, why personal records can be easily mined,"" he said. ""But there is no such protection."" Health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin on Friday said officials' records could no longer be accessed. Some social media users expressed dismay over flaws in the application, which was last month made mandatory. ""I trust the government's apps less and less after this,"" said a Twitter user under the handle @delrellove. Another user, Denny Siregar, who has more than a million followers, said: ""Our data protection is very low. Even the president's got leaked."" The application includes private biodata and displays vaccination dates and types administered. Its use is required for air travel and entering malls. Fadjroel Rachman, a presidential spokesman, said his office regretted the breach. ""We hope that relevant authorities can conduct certain procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening, including the protection of the people's data,"" he said. A data protection bill was submitted to parliament last year but has yet to be passed. The government on Tuesday said it was investigating a problem in an earlier version of the app that exposed data of about 1.3 million people. L4N2Q219C It came a few months after an alleged breach of social security data by a state insurer. ""The problem is still the same, there is no grand strategy to protect citizen data,"" said Damar Juniarto of digital advocacy group SAFEnet.

Caribbean tourism recovery punctured by new coronavirus spike,3613,"KINGSTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Just as tourism was beginning to show signs of recovery, the Caribbean has been hit by a new wave of coronavirus infections that is causing lockdowns and flight cancellations and overwhelming hospitals. Countries including Jamaica, Martinique, The Bahamas, Barbados, St. Lucia, and Dominica have seen a rise in cases fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant and a relaxation of earlier restrictions. Misinformation spread on social media has also contributed to a low vaccine uptake. The Caribbean is one of the regions most dependent on tourism, with nine countries in the world's top 20, according to an index compiled by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Many experienced double-digit declines in gross domestic product (GDP) growth when COVID-19 struck, drying up tourism dollars, destroying jobs and hurting their balance of payments. Since the latest wave of COVID-19 hit Dominica and the government ordered a lockdown - now lifted - business has been slow for Nahgie Laflouf, operations manager for adventure company Extreme Dominica on the island of some 70,000 people. ""Things are gone back a bit quiet,"" said Laflouf, who takes tourists hiking and rafting among Dominica's lush forests and waterfalls. ""They had started to pick up before the spike."" In August, there were four or five tours, when they might have had three times that before the COVID jump, Laflouf said. The outbreak has prompted governments to impose restrictions including curfews and mandatory vaccinations as they deal with too few hospital beds, low levels of oxygen and exhausted healthcare workers. Some countries, like the Cayman Islands, shut their borders to tourists, but others like Jamaica continued to welcome them, allowing the country of 3 million people to salvage some earnings. ""We have to double up our efforts to manage,"" Jamaican Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett told Reuters. ""The region is now on alert to deal with visitor hesitancy."" Jamaica's foreign exchange earnings from tourism fell $2.5 billion last year, a 74% drop from 2019, the government says. The IDB said vaccines are crucial to getting tourism back to normal and forecast that recovery to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity could take up until 2024 in some countries. Vaccine rollout in the Caribbean has been slow due to vaccine skepticism, logistical hold-ups and inadequate supply. Jamaica has administered enough doses to give two shots to about 9% of the population, data compiled by Reuters show. Since the start of July, new COVID-19 cases more than tripled and now stand above 69,000, while hospitalizations have risen almost sevenfold. Total cases in The Bahamas have jumped by almost half since the beginning of July. Active cases in Dominica skyrocketed from five on July 7 to 638 on Aug. 27. In Martinique, the French government announced a three-week lockdown on Aug. 10 and asked tourists to leave the country. ""Most of the shops are closed down, most of them have to put people on layoff,"" 41-year-old Cristal Joseph said by phone from the town of Le Lamentin, Martinique. In St. Lucia, infections are up eighteen-fold to over 1,900 since July 9, the Pan-American Health Organization said. Concerns that St. Lucia could end up on Britain's COVID-19 'red list' - which imposes an expensive quarantine on Britons returning from such nations - are hurting tourism, said Norbert Williams, a spokesman for the opposition United Workers Party.

Australian PM seeks quicker reopening after COVID-19 vaccine swap with Britain,2922,"SYDNEY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Australia will receive an additional 4 million doses of Pfizer's (PFE.N) COVID-19 vaccine this month after agreeing a swap deal with Britain, to help accelerate its vaccination programme amid a record surge in infections. The deal, announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday, will double the availability of Pfizer vaccines this month, with the first shipment of vaccines from Britain expected to arrive over the weekend. Australia on Friday recorded its biggest one-day rise in COVID-19 infections, with 1,657 new cases and 13 deaths reported in the past 24 hours. ""On a difficult day like this, it’s important to bring hope. And, I can assure you, there is hope,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""This will enable us to bring forward significantly the opportunity for Australia to open up again."" Australia agreed a similar swap arrangement with Singapore earlier this week. Both deals will see Australia return Pfizer vaccines later in the year when the bulk of Canberra's order is delivered. ""Our agreement with Australia will share doses at the optimum time to bolster both our countries’ vaccination programmes,"" Sajid Javid, Britain's Health Secretary, said in an emailed statement.

REUTERS/Sandra Sanders LIVE WITH COVID The surge in infections could make it more difficult for Morrison to persuade state and territories to remove lockdowns and restrictions on travel across state boundaries once 80% of their population over 16 years old are fully vaccinated. Most of the new cases were again in Sydney, and New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned residents to brace for a spike in numbers as the next two weeks. New South Wales and Victoria have warned people that they will now have to learn to live with COVID-19, though several other states have walked back on their commitment to the national plan. These states, which are free of COVID-19, argue that the current third wave of infections makes it too risky to go along with the national plan to re-open borders. The ongoing restrictions are threatening to drive Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy into its second recession in as many years, and the discord over how to move forward will be a challenge for Morrison, who must call an election before May 2022. A total of nearly 58,200 cases and 1,032 deaths have been recorded in Australia since the pandemic began, far lower than many comparable countries, but the Delta outbreak has cast doubt on whether it is wise to pursue elimination strategies.

Britain set to raise taxes to pay for social care - reports,2795,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The British government is planning a tax hike for around 25 million people to help fund adult social care and the National Health Service, newspapers reported on Friday. The state-run National Health Service (NHS), which has provided healthcare that's free at the point of use for more than 70 years, is a hugely emotive issue and successive governments have avoided tackling the challenge of how to meet the growing costs of funding adult social care. The Telegraph and The Times said the government was looking at hiking National Insurance social security contribution rates by between 1 and 2 percentage points in return for capping the amount an individual would have to spend on social care costs in their lifetime. ""Work is going on and I'm sure we will hear the outcomes very soon,"" justice minister Robert Buckland told Sky News when asked about the reports. ""No final decisions have been made."" The move would break a 2019 election promise by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives not to raise the rate of income tax, the VAT sales tax or National Insurance. ""The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have got to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,"" Buckland told BBC News. After winning the 2019 election with a big parliamentary majority, Johnson said he had a ""clear plan"" to fix the crisis in social care. But his agenda was soon eclipsed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports said an announcement could come next week. Before an election in 2017, Johnson's predecessor Theresa May saw her party's large lead in opinion polls dwindle after she proposed that people should pay more of the costs of social care which opponents dubbed a ""dementia tax"". Johnson's office favours a 1% rise in the tax, while the finance ministry is possibly looking at a higher rate of up to 1.25%, the Telegraph reported. The Times said health minister Sajid Javid had pushed for as much as a 2% rise. The opposition Labour Party said the move would hit low earners, young people and business. The Telegraph said that in return for the higher contributions, the government would cap the amount a person spends on social care costs during their lifetime, possibly at between 60,000 pounds ($83,010) and 80,000 pounds. It would also raise the level of assets an individual could hold while also receiving government help to cover social care costs. Both measures were aimed at better protecting people from having to sell their home to pay for care, the Telegraph said. The package would also include extra funding for the NHS to help tackle waiting lists which have spiralled during the COVID-19 pandemic, the report added.

U.S. shipped more than 2 mln COVID-19 doses to Kenya and Ghana,1033,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday shipped more than 2 million doses of Moderna's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine to Kenya and Ghana on Thursday through the COVAX global distribution program, a White House official said.

Israeli troops shoot Palestinian dead in Gaza border clashes,2003,"GAZA/TEL AVIV, Sept 2 (Reuters) - (This Sept. 2 story corrects paragraph eight to add Hamas member) Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian along the Gaza border on Thursday as hundreds set fire to tyres and threw stones, Gaza's health ministry said. The Israeli military said that over 1,000 Palestinians had gathered along the fortified frontier, hurling explosives and setting tyres ablaze. ""IDF (Israeli military) troops deployed in the area are using riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire and .22 Caliber rounds,"" the military said in a statement. Gaza's health ministry said the man killed had been shot in the abdomen. Five others were wounded by Israeli fire, including a child who is in critical condition, it said. Sanctioned by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas, Palestinians have staged nightly protests along the border this week to voice anger at an Israeli-led blockade of the territory. Israel cites threats from Hamas for the restrictions. The protests add to a recent rise in cross-border violence that has tested a fragile truce that ended 11 days of deadly Israel-Hamas fighting in May. Since the Egyptian-mediated ceasefire, Palestinians have sporadically sent balloons carrying incendiary material into Israel, igniting brush fires and drawing Israeli air strikes on Hamas facilities in Gaza.

EXCLUSIVE U.S. funding tapped for Pacific undersea cable after China rebuffed,4160,"SYDNEY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The Federated States of Micronesia will tap a U.S. funding facility to construct a Pacific undersea communications cable, two sources told Reuters, after rejecting a Chinese company-led proposal that was deemed a security threat by U.S. officials. The United States has taken great interest in several plans in recent years to lay optic fibre cables across the Pacific, projects that would bring vastly improved communications to island nations. The undersea cables have far greater data capacity than satellites, leading Washington to raise concerns that the involvement of Chinese firms would compromise regional security. Beijing has consistently denied any intent to use cable infrastructure for spying. Two sources with knowledge of the plans said FSM would use U.S. funds to construct a line between two of its four states, Kosrae to Pohnpei, replicating part of a route proposed under a previous $72.6 million project backed by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Reuters reported in June that project, which also encompassed Nauru and Kiribati, was scuppered after Washington raised concerns the contract would be awarded to Huawei Marine, now called HMN Technologies and majority owned by Shanghai-listed Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd. read more . One source told Reuters that FSM would draw around $14 million from the American Rescue Plan, a U.S. facility created by President Joe Biden to distribute funds both at home and abroad to combat the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. FSM said it was committed to providing fibre connectivity to the State of Kosrae, and onward connectivity to Kiribati and Nauru. It did not respond directly to questions about U.S. funding. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. The United States and FSM have a long geopolitical relationship, enshrined in the Compact of Free Association, a decades-old agreement between the United States and its former Pacific trust territories. Under that agreement, Washington is responsible for the island nation's defence. The second source said the U.S. funded cable would likely connect to the HANTRU-1 undersea cable, a line primarily used by the U.S. government that connects to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The World Bank said in a statement it was working with FSM and Kiribati to map out their next steps after the original tender for the larger project concluded with no contract awarded. PACIFIC POLITICS Undersea cables represent one of the newest and most sensitive fronts in the rivalry between China and the U.S. in the strategic waters of the Pacific. While FSM has close ties to the United States, it also has long-standing diplomatic and trade relations with China. Prominent U.S. lawmakers have warned that Chinese companies could undermine competitive tenders by offering state-subsidised bids Reuters previously reported. read more The U.S. Commerce Department publicly lists Huawei Marine on its so-called ""Entity List"" - known as a blacklist - which restricts the sale of U.S. goods and technology to the company. The Department told Reuters that Huawei's new owner, HMN Tech, would also be captured under these restrictions. China has strongly refuted the allegations. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters that Chinese companies had a good record in cybersecurity. ""The so-called security threat [alleged] by the U.S. is totally groundless, and has ulterior motives,"" the statement said. ""Who the 'hacker empire' really is - engaging in spying and stealing secrets - is plain to the world."" Australia, a strong regional ally to the United States, has ramped up its presence in the Pacific through the creation of a A$2 billion ($1.48 billion) infrastructure financing facility that island nations can potentially access for cable projects. Nauru has been negotiating plans to tap into the Australian-backed Coral Sea Cable system, via Solomon Islands, sources told Reuters in June. read more ($1 = 1.3510 Australian dollars) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Fall of Japan PM Suga triggered by criticism over pandemic, failure to communicate",2615,"TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - When Yoshihide Suga took over as Japan's prime minister last year, hopes were high that skills honed over years as a keen backroom operator, and a common touch from his rural roots, would enable him to lead his nation through the pandemic. Instead, the virus surged back amid a rocky vaccination rollout and a series of ""states of emergency"" that did little to stop the spread of the more contagious Delta variant. Suga, 72, also insisted on holding the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, postponed from last year, despite widespread public opposition. But his support rates sank below 30% ahead of a ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership race and general election this year. On Friday, facing a revolt inside his own party, Suga said he would step down to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for his replacement as premier after just one year in office. Known for his steely gaze and sharp, sometimes irritable, replies during news conferences as chief cabinet secretary and right-hand man to predecessor Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Suga took over in September 2020 when Abe abruptly quit, citing health problems. His image as a savvy political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74 percent when he took office. Initially, populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments were applauded. He also set up a digital agency to unify central and local government technology systems, an area where Japan has lagged. But removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a his junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism. His delay in halting the ""Go To"" domestic travel programme - which experts say probably helped spread the coronavirus - hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses. Perceptions that he was more focused on hosting the Olympics than the pandemic also eroded support, although authorities have denied any link between the Games and the spike in infections. Critics blamed poor communications skills at news conferences in parliament for failing to unite the public behind largely voluntary pandemic restrictions. By August, when the Olympics closed, Suga's support had slid below 30%, alarming party leaders and junior lawmakers ahead of an election for the powerful lower house of parliament that must be held this year and leading to talk about unseating him.

S.Korea extends distancing curbs ahead of thanksgiving holiday,2054,"SEOUL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South Korea on Friday extended social distancing curbs for several weeks to rein in COVID-19 outbreaks nationwide as the country supercharges its vaccination campaign ahead of a thanksgiving holiday later this month. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said the toughest level 4 restrictions in greater Seoul and level 3 curbs in the rest of the country would run through to Oct. 3. However, he also announced that restaurants and cafes in the greater Seoul area would be allowed to close an hour later each evening and families would be allowed to gather in groups of up to eight people in the week of the Sept. 21 Chuseok holiday. Kim has been balancing providing incentives for people to get vaccinated with reining in an outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant that started in July. read more The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 1,709 new COVID-19 cases for Thursday, 1,675 of which were locally acquired. Korea has recorded a total of 257,110 infections since the pandemic started, with 2,308 deaths. The Health Ministry said the current outbreak is likely to intensify in early September, possibly peaking at 2,300 daily cases, before subsiding toward the end of the month. That would surpass the record2,223 cases reported on Aug 11. ""We fear a spike in outbreaks from increased movement around the Chuseok holiday,"" Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol told a briefing. The allowance for eight people to gather for Chuseok is dependent on at least four having completed their vaccination, and in greater Seoul will be restricted to house gatherings. Kwon said the government plans to deliver a first vaccine dose to 70% of the 52 million population by Chuseok, and complete inoculation for half the population by the end of September. Around 58% of the population has currently received one dose, with about 33% fully vaccinated. The inoculation programme has been credited with keeping the country's mortality rate at a relatively low 0.9%. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand sees success in curbing Delta outbreak as new cases plunge,1737,"WELLINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported 28 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, a big drop compared to the last few days, as authorities said the country was breaking the chain of transmission of the highly infectious Delta variant of coronavirus. Authorities said 27 new cases were in Auckland and one was in Wellington. Friday's numbers were lower than 49 new cases reported on Thursday and 75 the day before. ""While the fall is encouraging we are mindful these outbreaks can have a long tail...,"" Director of Public Health Dr Caroline McEnlay said in a news conference. ""We are being successful in breaking the chain of transmission,"" she said. Barring a few cases in February, New Zealand had been largely free of coronavirus until the Delta outbreak prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order the snap lockdown last month. About 1.7 million people in the largest city of Auckland still remain in strict level 4 lockdown. Curbs have been eased in the rest of the countries but schools and offices as well as cafe, restaurants and all public venues remain shut. Most New Zealanders have been asked to stay indoors. Ardern's lockdowns and international border closure since March 2020 have been credited with reining in COVID-19, largely freeing up day-to-day activities from curbs. But the government faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout that has left a majority of the population exposed to the latest outbreak. Just over a quarter of New Zealand's 5.1 million people have been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. New Zealand has reported 3,372 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began and 26 related deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
First Katrina and now Ida: Some residents think about giving up,3639,"GRAND ISLE, La., Sept 2 (Reuters) - Jim King, 75, surveyed the damage to his home on Grand Isle, Louisiana, on Thursday, a house he rebuilt himself after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago. Hurricane Ida wrought new havoc this week. King said he and his wife have just about had enough. He was stuck on the deck of his home after Hurricane Ida ripped off the stairs that gave him access to the road below. He flagged down a helicopter and asked for a ladder to descend to the road. ""These storms are only going to get more powerful,"" King said, marooned on his deck after the steps leading to the road below were obliterated by Ida. He said his wife wants to talk about ""whether we continue to live here. And I agree."" King spoke as shattered communities across southern Louisiana were still assessing storm damage from Ida on Thursday as floodwaters had yet to recede in many places four days after the hurricane knocked out power to a million homes and businesses. The Category 4 hurricane came ashore on the barrier islands and swampy lowlands known as the bayou, where many small towns are difficult to reach even without roads being clogged with fallen trees, power lines and debris hurled about by gusts of wind that reached 172 miles per hour (276 kph). Ida leveled Grand Isle, a town of 740 on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico, where officials said virtually every structure sustained damage and about 40% were destroyed. About three feet (one meter) of sand covered the island, rendering it uninhabitable. Around 600,000 people had no water and another 400,000 were advised to boil their tap water before drinking it, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said. At least nine deaths have been reported. On Grand Isle many had roofs blown off and some were reduced to rubble. Downed power lines lay tangled along the only road onto the island where Paul Delise, 52, owns a vacation home. ""The inside is all tore up. I don't know if it's restorable,"" he said. ""Nobody around here has seen anything like this. I lived through Katrina and as bad as it was it wasn't a wind event like this. This place is never going to be back how it was."" Kendall Simoneaux, 49, a maintenance worker at the Hurricane Hole Hotel on the island, said his team planned to bring in excavators and bulldozers. ""The debris is easy to pick up but it's the sand. It's heavy. It's almost like cement,"" he said. Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng told a news conference after flying over Grand Isle and the rest of Ida's path on Wednesday that the community was ""broken."" ""We don't have electricity. We don't have communication. We don't have gas or water, and sewer systems are very fragile,"" Lee Sheng said. Wrecked neighborhoods looked like ""a little pile of matchsticks,"" she added. President Joe Biden was scheduled to survey the destruction for himself on Friday, when Edwards said he would present a long lists of needs. Louisiana hospitals were already crowded with COVID-19 patients and short of nurses before Ida. Edwards said 2,447 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized on Wednesday, including 446 on ventilators. The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday that four nursing home residents who had been evacuated to a warehouse used as a shelter in Tangipahoa Parish recently died, with three of the deaths related to the hurricane, and one under investigation. The department said it was investigating seven nursing homes for sending over 800 residents to the warehouse, where conditions were so bad a rescue operation had to be launched to remove them from the facility.

South Carolina Supreme Court strikes down city's school mask mandate,2276,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Carolina's Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a school mask mandate in the state's capital city in the midst of its largest surge in COVID-19 cases since last winter. In the latest of several such legal cases across a nation where cultural and political clashes have erupted over the COVID-19 response, the court ruled 5-0 to issue a declaratory judgment for South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who brought the case against the city of Columbia. Wilson, a Republican, argued a state law that allows parents to decide whether their children wear masks in school trumps the city's mask mandate ordinance for private and public elementary and middle school students and staff. The emergency school mask ordinance, brought by Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin in response to the surge in infections, had been approved by the city council in Columbia two weeks ago. The ordinance, which also applied to daycare centers, was aimed at children too young to be vaccinated. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said in a tweet that the court had come to ""a sound conclusion"" based on the rule of law. ""A parent's right to decide what's best for their child is now definitively protected by state law,"" he said, while encouraging residents to get vaccinated. Benjamin, a Democrat, said in a statement that the city ""will always act to preserve and protect the lives, health and safety of our children. This is a sad day for children in South Carolina."" The justices wrote in their opinion that they ""fully recognize that strong and passionate opinions exist on both sides of this debate,"" but are constitutionally bound to only interpret and apply existing laws and not make policy. The South Carolina legislature in June passed a provision in the state budget prohibiting cities from enacting mask mandates. Two weeks ago, the Texas Supreme Court rejected Governor Greg Abbott's attempt to suspend a mask mandate. A state judge in Florida last week ruled that Governor Ron DeSantis' administration cannot ban public school districts from requiring face masks. Southern states, including South Carolina, have seen a recent spike in COVID-19 cases, partly due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Texas abortion ban injects new urgency into U.S. election campaigns,6910,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sept 2 (Reuters) - After the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to block a near-total ban on abortions by Texas, alarmed Democratic candidates and abortion rights advocates had a single, urgent message for voters on Thursday: Abortion rights are on the ballot. Within hours of the court's decision, Democrats running in gubernatorial elections in California and Virginia this year warned their Republican rivals would outlaw abortion if they won, while making impassioned fundraising appeals. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-controlled chamber will vote to protect abortion rights nationwide later this month, but that faces uncertain prospects in the Senate. For decades, Democrats have sounded the alarm about potential Republican attacks on abortion rights in the states and in the courts, often to their political benefit. But now, the threat is no longer ""hypothetical,"" said Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for the Democratic State Legislative Committee, which aims to elect Democrats to state legislatures. While fearful about the Supreme Court's willingness to consider challenges to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Democratic groups hope that the issue will galvanize moderate suburban voters and women to turn out in off-year elections, which will decide control of Congress and many state legislatures. Aside from Texas, four other Republican-led states have also passed laws that outlaw all or nearly all abortions, and the Republican president of the Florida state Senate said on Thursday he would try to pass a similar ban. ""This should be a warning to all states in America they could go the way of Texas,"" Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Republicans, by contrast, largely avoided commenting on the decision. Several Republican groups responsible for winning congressional and legislative elections likewise did not respond to a request for comment. About 52 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36 percent think it should be illegal, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support abortion rights, though support has risen somewhat among both groups in recent years. While Republicans have harnessed conservatives' anti-abortion views to their advantage in past elections, Democrats could benefit this time around if they see abortion rights directly under threat, political analysts said. On Thursday, the Democratic Governors Association asked for donations to help protect reproductive rights in this year's gubernatorial races in Virginia, New Jersey and California. ""The threat wasn't real enough until recently to trigger mobilization on the left,"" said University of Michigan political scientist Nicholas Valentino, who cautioned that the November 2022 elections were still far off. Between now and the end of 2022, voters will elect governors in 38 states, as well as 91 of the 99 legislative chambers. Control of both chambers of Congress will also be at stake. The first of those elections is in California on Sept. 14, where Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom faces a possible recall. Newsom's campaign plans to work with abortion rights advocates to ensure that Democratic voters don't stay home that day, spokesman Nathan Click said. ""Texas has effectively banned a woman's right to choose,"" Newsom said on Twitter. ""This could be the future of CA if we don't vote NO on the Republican Recall by 9/14."" In Virginia, which votes for governor and state assembly in November, McAuliffe's campaign has released two ads saying Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin wants to ban abortion and will continue hammering him on that point, his campaign said. Youngkin's campaign responded by calling McAuliffe a ""pro-abortion extremist"" on Twitter. Youngkin has said he opposes abortion but has not made it a major focus of his campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said he did not think the Texas law alone was enough to ignite widespread revolt against Republicans in suburbs around the state. ""There needs to be a Trump-esque type of threat to the Democrats, and that would have to be the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Stein said. DEMOCRATS STRUGGLE IN STATES The Supreme Court ruling highlights Democrats' struggles to make gains outside of Washington in an era of growing political polarization. Party officials privately acknowledge that they have not paid enough attention to state races over the past decade after Republicans have consolidated gains at that level. Democrats raised a record $51 million to devote to legislative races last year, but still failed to win control in their targeted states of Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Republicans control the governor's mansion and the legislature in 23 of the 50 states and are poised to use redistricting to lock in their advantage over the coming decade. Democrats control 15 states and partisan advantage is divided in the remainder. The divide on abortion is especially stark. State legislatures enacted a record 90 abortion restrictions in the first half of the year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Almost all of those laws, including several that ban abortions entirely, were passed in Republican-controlled states. Many Democratic-controlled states, meanwhile, have expanded abortion access. Texas represents a particular frustration for Democrats, who have seen a growing minority population as an opportunity to flip the most populous Republican-led state. But they have repeatedly come up short in state contests, and this week the Republican-led legislature passed new restrictions on voting and an expansion of gun rights. Republicans said opinion polls show that voters support what they have been doing. ""All indications are that Texas voters believe in protecting easy and fraud-resistant access to polls, they believe in the protection of life ... they believe in the right to self defense,"" said James Dickey, a former head of the Texas Republican Party. Democratic strategists say the Supreme Court decision could help their candidates in suburban areas that have trended away from the Republicans in recent years. ""Republicans for years have been competing against one another to be more and more extreme,"" said Mike Collier, a Democrat who is challenging incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick in Texas. ""They are creating tremendous, tremendous political liabilities."""

"Reed back in action, feared for his life during hospital stay",2064,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Former Masters champion Patrick Reed returned to action at the season-ending Tour Championship on Thursday in Atlanta after a recent hospital stay for bilateral pneumonia that he revealed left him fearing for his life. After playing his first competitive round in 25 days, Reed spent plenty of time during his post-round news conference at East Lake discussing an illness that resulted in a week-long stay at a Houston hospital. ""First couple days they were sitting there telling me that make sure you text your family quite a bit, talk to your family, because you just don't know. I mean, this is not good. We're not in a good spot right now,"" Reed told reporters. ""The only thing that was going through my mind is, I'm not going to be able to tell my kids goodbye. I'm not going to be able to tell them I love them. I'm not going to be able to tell my wife that I love her and give her a hug."" A nine-times winner of the PGA Tour, Reed said he was happy not to show any ill-effects after having missed the first two events of the FedExCup Playoffs. Reed, who only resumed practice on Monday and was the 30th and final man to make the field at the Tour Championship, shot a two-over-par 72 at East Lake but was well off the pace due in large part to a staggered scoring system for the finale. ""As a whole, I feel optimistic, obviously with the way I finished, getting through 18 and not feeling like my health is hindering me,"" Reed said. Reed added he probably would not be playing this week if it were not for his determination to earn a spot on the U.S. team to play Europe in the Sept. 24-26 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin. Having not secured an automatic spot on the team, Reed is hoping to convince U.S. captain Steve Stricker to make him one of the remaining six players selected. ""Honestly, the biggest thing is, talking with Stricks and stuff, is just making sure I'm healthy and I think the biggest thing for me this week is just to see kind of where I'm at,"" said Reed.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-controlled chamber will vote to protect abortion rights nationwide later this month, but that faces uncertain prospects in the Senate. For decades, Democrats have sounded the alarm about potential Republican attacks on abortion rights in the states and in the courts, often to their political benefit. But now, the threat is no longer ""hypothetical,"" said Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for the Democratic State Legislative Committee, which aims to elect Democrats to state legislatures. While fearful about the Supreme Court's willingness to consider challenges to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Democratic groups hope that the issue will galvanize moderate suburban voters and women to turn out in off-year elections, which will decide control of Congress and many state legislatures. Aside from Texas, four other Republican-led states have also passed laws that outlaw all or nearly all abortions, and the Republican president of the Florida state Senate said on Thursday he would try to pass a similar ban. ""This should be a warning to all states in America they could go the way of Texas,"" Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Republicans, by contrast, largely avoided commenting on the decision. Several Republican groups responsible for winning congressional and legislative elections likewise did not respond to a request for comment. About 52 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36 percent think it should be illegal, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support abortion rights, though support has risen somewhat among both groups in recent years. While Republicans have harnessed conservatives' anti-abortion views to their advantage in past elections, Democrats could benefit this time around if they see abortion rights directly under threat, political analysts said. On Thursday, the Democratic Governors Association asked for donations to help protect reproductive rights in this year's gubernatorial races in Virginia, New Jersey and California. ""The threat wasn't real enough until recently to trigger mobilization on the left,"" said University of Michigan political scientist Nicholas Valentino, who cautioned that the November 2022 elections were still far off. Between now and the end of 2022, voters will elect governors in 38 states, as well as 91 of the 99 legislative chambers. Control of both chambers of Congress will also be at stake. The first of those elections is in California on Sept. 14, where Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom faces a possible recall. Newsom's campaign plans to work with abortion rights advocates to ensure that Democratic voters don't stay home that day, spokesman Nathan Click said. ""Texas has effectively banned a woman's right to choose,"" Newsom said on Twitter. ""This could be the future of CA if we don't vote NO on the Republican Recall by 9/14."" In Virginia, which votes for governor and state assembly in November, McAuliffe's campaign has released two ads saying Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin wants to ban abortion and will continue hammering him on that point, his campaign said. Youngkin's campaign responded by calling McAuliffe a ""pro-abortion extremist"" on Twitter. Youngkin has said he opposes abortion but has not made it a major focus of his campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said he did not think the Texas law alone was enough to ignite widespread revolt against Republicans in suburbs around the state. ""There needs to be a Trump-esque type of threat to the Democrats, and that would have to be the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Stein said. DEMOCRATS STRUGGLE IN STATES The Supreme Court ruling highlights Democrats' struggles to make gains outside of Washington in an era of growing political polarization. Party officials privately acknowledge that they have not paid enough attention to state races over the past decade after Republicans have consolidated gains at that level. Democrats raised a record $51 million to devote to legislative races last year, but still failed to win control in their targeted states of Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Republicans control the governor's mansion and the legislature in 23 of the 50 states and are poised to use redistricting to lock in their advantage over the coming decade. Democrats control 15 states and partisan advantage is divided in the remainder. The divide on abortion is especially stark. State legislatures enacted a record 90 abortion restrictions in the first half of the year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Almost all of those laws, including several that ban abortions entirely, were passed in Republican-controlled states. Many Democratic-controlled states, meanwhile, have expanded abortion access. Texas represents a particular frustration for Democrats, who have seen a growing minority population as an opportunity to flip the most populous Republican-led state. But they have repeatedly come up short in state contests, and this week the Republican-led legislature passed new restrictions on voting and an expansion of gun rights. Republicans said opinion polls show that voters support what they have been doing. ""All indications are that Texas voters believe in protecting easy and fraud-resistant access to polls, they believe in the protection of life ... they believe in the right to self defense,"" said James Dickey, a former head of the Texas Republican Party. Democratic strategists say the Supreme Court decision could help their candidates in suburban areas that have trended away from the Republicans in recent years. ""Republicans for years have been competing against one another to be more and more extreme,"" said Mike Collier, a Democrat who is challenging incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick in Texas. ""They are creating tremendous, tremendous political liabilities."""
COVID-19 test maker Labcorp raises minimum hourly wage to $15,1012,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LH.N) said it has increased the minimum hourly wage for U.S.-based employees to $15 from $10.95, joining several other companies in implementing new measures to retain staff amid a nationwide labor shortage. The diagnostic tests maker, which has more than 70,000 employees, said on Thursday the new minimum wage for non-union employees is effective this month.

"Reed back in action, feared for his life during hospital stay",2064,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Former Masters champion Patrick Reed returned to action at the season-ending Tour Championship on Thursday in Atlanta after a recent hospital stay for bilateral pneumonia that he revealed left him fearing for his life. After playing his first competitive round in 25 days, Reed spent plenty of time during his post-round news conference at East Lake discussing an illness that resulted in a week-long stay at a Houston hospital. ""First couple days they were sitting there telling me that make sure you text your family quite a bit, talk to your family, because you just don't know. I mean, this is not good. We're not in a good spot right now,"" Reed told reporters. ""The only thing that was going through my mind is, I'm not going to be able to tell my kids goodbye. I'm not going to be able to tell them I love them. I'm not going to be able to tell my wife that I love her and give her a hug."" A nine-times winner of the PGA Tour, Reed said he was happy not to show any ill-effects after having missed the first two events of the FedExCup Playoffs. Reed, who only resumed practice on Monday and was the 30th and final man to make the field at the Tour Championship, shot a two-over-par 72 at East Lake but was well off the pace due in large part to a staggered scoring system for the finale. ""As a whole, I feel optimistic, obviously with the way I finished, getting through 18 and not feeling like my health is hindering me,"" Reed said. Reed added he probably would not be playing this week if it were not for his determination to earn a spot on the U.S. team to play Europe in the Sept. 24-26 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin. Having not secured an automatic spot on the team, Reed is hoping to convince U.S. captain Steve Stricker to make him one of the remaining six players selected. ""Honestly, the biggest thing is, talking with Stricks and stuff, is just making sure I'm healthy and I think the biggest thing for me this week is just to see kind of where I'm at,"" said Reed.

U.S. Senator Manchin wants a pause in Democrats' push for $3.5 trillion spending bill,3054,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Senator Joe Manchin on Thursday urged fellow Democrats to pause in their push to enact a $3.5 trillion spending bill encompassing much of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, casting doubt on whether and when they will be able to advance the package. ""Instead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and additional stimulus funding, Congress should hit a strategic pause on the budget-reconciliation legislation,"" Manchin, a moderate West Virginia lawmaker, wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate are currently crafting legislation to fill in the details of a $3.5 trillion spending outline that both chambers approved last month. The package, which Democratic leaders hope to pass in the coming weeks along with a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, would advance progressives' ambitious plans to fight climate change and expand childcare, healthcare and other social programs. But Democrats need to keep the party unified to get both plans through. ""I for one, won't support a $3.5 trillion bill, or anywhere near that level of additional spending, without greater clarity about why Congress chooses to ignore the serious effects inflation and debt have on existing government programs,"" Manchin wrote in the Journal. It was not the first time he has said the spending plan's price tag was too high. He also did so shortly after voting to advance the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint last month, saying he was worried about the ""grave consequences"" of such spending on the nation's debt as well as the country's ability to respond to other potential crises. Biden's Democrats have literally no votes to spare if they are to push the spending legislation through Congress this autumn. They are seeking to advance it in the 50-50 Senate through a special budget reconciliation process that would allow it to pass with a simple majority in the chamber, where legislation usually requires 60 votes to advance. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote. Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the House as well, and with no Republican support expected for the $3.5 trillion plan, Manchin's opinion - or that of any single Democratic lawmaker - matters. Another moderate Democrat, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, has also said she will not support $3.5 trillion in spending. Manchin's opinion piece appeared a day after he made similar comments to the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. Progressive Democrats - many of whom have threatened not to back the $1 trillion infrastructure plan if the $3.5 trillion spending package does not pass the Senate - responded forcefully. ""Pause on finally delivering child care, paid leave, education, health care, affordable housing, climate action, and dental, vision, and hearing to millions of families across America? Absolutely not,"" Representative Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on Twitter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Medtech firm Baxter to buy hospital-bed maker Hill-Rom for $10.5 bln,2024,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. medtech firm Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) said on Thursday it would buy rival Hill-Rom Holdings Inc (HRC.N) for about $10.5 billion, adding smart hospital beds to its portfolio of patient monitoring and diagnostic products. Baxter said it would pay $156 per Hill-Rom share, a premium of 7.5% to the stock's last close. Hill-Rom shares were trading up 3% at 149.85 before the bell on Thursday, while Baxter shares rose 1%. Media reports had earlier said the companies had been in talks for months and Hill-Rom in July had rejected a $144 per share offer from Baxter, deeming it too low. On Monday, Reuters reported the companies were nearing a deal. Medical equipment makers in recent months have broadened their offerings through acquisitions to cash in on the sector's recovery from the pandemic-driven slump last year. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc in April agreed to buy contract researcher PPD Inc (PPD.O) for $17.4 billion, while Medtronic (MDT.N) recently snapped up Intersect ENT (XENT.O) in a $936.2 million deal. Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter's business grew in the pandemic due to demand for its renal blood purification systems devices PrisMax and Prismaflex, but has been hit by rising costs and stiffer competition for some products. 106-year-old Hill-Rom makes most of its revenue from its patient support systems, which include smart hospital beds that use sensors and other technology to help monitor patients. Baxter expects the deal, worth about $12.4 billion including debt, to close early next year and to help grow earnings by more than 20% within the three years after. However, analysts have presented a mixed view of the deal, with some saying investors could be concerned about Hill-Rom not having fast-growing revenue. ""The key to share performance will depend on how well Baxter can articulate the strategic rationale and allay fears of growth dilution,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a note on Monday.

(Reuters) - Epstein Becker Green has opened a new office in Columbus, Ohio, and has poached a 12-partner team focused on healthcare from Bricker & Eckler. The team joining the more than 300-lawyer firm will be led by partners Jennifer Nelson Carney, Stephen Kleinman, and James Petrie. They will be based in Epstein Becker's 16th national office, the first in Ohio, and will focus on healthcare, labor and employment, and litigation. “Healthcare, labor and employment lawyers in a group that were aspiring to bring their talents on to a national platform was why we were attracted to the conversation,” said Mark Lutes, chair of the firm's board of directors. Carney, former chair of Bricker & Eckler’s Health Care group and now a partner at Epstein Becker, said that the firm’s specialized health and life sciences focus drew the team to the firm. She said that the veteran team is eager to partner with Epstein Becker's attorneys now that community hospitals, which used to make up a large portion of the team's practice, are becoming parts of sophisticated healthcare systems with complex needs. “We were excited to expand our platform, beyond Ohio, and to tap into the great federal resources that Epstein Becker has,” said Carney. In a Thursday memo, Jim Flynn, managing partner of Bricker & Eckler, which has seven offices in Ohio and about 130 attorneys, said that he wished the team well. “Make no mistake, Bricker & Eckler remains strong and very well-equipped to provide our clients with excellent personal service and outstanding value,” wrote Flynn. Flynn will take over as head of Bricker & Eckler’s healthcare practice, a position he held in the past, in addition to acting as the firm's managing partner, according to the memo.

Walmart's wage bump signals pressure to raise pay in industry battle for labor,4452,"CHICAGO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (WMT.N) move on Thursday to give 565,000 of its U.S. store workers raises of at least $1 puts the spotlight on the industry's tight, competitive labor market as the all-important holiday shopping season is set to kick off. Worth nearly $800 billion last year in the United States alone, the holidays mark the busiest time of the year for stores, making up a majority of their annual sales as people shop on and around Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas. Retailers hire tens of thousands of temporary workers across the country to keep up with crowds of people in stores and online, paying competitive wages and offering benefits. Last year, for instance, big-box rival Target provided a coronavirus health plan and paid workers $15 an hour, versus $13 an hour in 2019. But a nationwide worker shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic has retailers concerned they will not have enough workers in stores and warehouses to handle to extra sales online and in stores. ""The biggest challenge for retailers going into the holiday season is going to be how do they get the sales associates and the warehouse workers in position to fulfill demand,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of consultancy Kearney. With its third wage hike over the past year, Walmart's U.S. average hourly wage is now $16.40, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive John Furner said in a memo to staff. The mean hourly wage for retail salespeople is $14.87, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers in Walmart's shop floor, food and consumable and general merchandise departments will receive the higher wages, effective Sept. 25, Furner said. 'POVERTY WAGES' The hike in pay wasn't enough for some workers who have long fought for more money. ""When Walmart touts its average pay at $16.40 an hour, it distracts from the reality that its business model still relies on poverty wages,"" said Cynthia Murray, 65, a 20-year Walmart worker from Laurel, Maryland, and a member of labor group United for Respect. Murray called for Walmart's minimum wage to increase to $15 an hour at minimum, at a time when workers face ongoing risk of contracting the virus. For others, however, it's not all about pay. In July, Walmart said it would pay 100% of college tuition and book costs for its associates. That policy is what is keeping Cincinnati, Ohio-based Jacob, 19, around as the retailer pays his tuition for a correspondence course in business administration at Southern New Hampshire University. ""Once I graduate college, I do plan on finding a better job,"" said Jacob, who declined to provide his last name out of fear of losing his job. 'BACK INTO THE HARNESS' The news comes days before the national end of federal unemployment benefits, which has been anticipated by employers who hope a lot of people once scared by COVID will return to the workforce. ""This is significant. I mean, if you look at it in percentage terms it's not much, but this is Walmart - they don't really do this,"" said Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington. ""Companies are having trouble getting people back into the harness after being out for so long and this is another sign that the labor market is readjusting."" Smaller retailers aren't immune to the issue either. Chicago's Abt Electronics, a household name in Illinois, said it has raised its minimum wage by just over 10%. Worker wages and benefits are the most expensive operational cost for many retailers, whose workers have long fought for higher wages through unions and organizations including Fight for $15. Unions have shone a spotlight this year on pay in the industry, a issue that received tremendous attention after an attempt by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers to organize at a warehouse in Alabama. A Reuters analysis of two decades of wage data showed earlier this year that workers in unions reap higher wages. Walmart, which is not unionized, raised pay for more than 425,000 stocking and digital associates earlier this year. It said on Wednesday it plans to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division. Dollar General (DG.N) said this week it is looking to hire more workers and truck drivers to whom it is offering a $5,000 sign-on bonus. Target, Best Buy and other major retailers have yet to announce any holiday wage increases or benefits. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Greenberg Traurig taps ex-FDA associate chief litigation counsel,2739,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Greenberg Traurig on Thursday announced it had tapped a U.S. Food and Drug Administration litigator for its health care and litigation practices. James Fraser has joined Greenberg Traurig as a shareholder after serving as the FDA's associate chief counsel for litigation for five years. Prior to joining the FDA in 2016, Fraser was at Venable for 11 years. ""This was a great landing spot for me. I could not be happier to be here at Greenberg Traurig,"" Fraser said. He will work in both the firm's health care & FDA practice and its litigation practice. Fraser represented the FDA and worked with the U.S. Department of Justice in litigation as companies challenged the agency's decision-making on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other products. He also filed civil enforcement actions against companies for allegedly violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Now back in private practice, Fraser said he hopes to leverage his FDA experience in advising life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical and medical device firms, in complex product liability cases or in litigation with the agency. Fraser won't be among strangers. In May, Greenberg Traurig welcomed back one of his former colleagues -- Robert Charrow, the general counsel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- as the senior chairman of its health care & FDA practice. Fraser also counts Lori Cohen, the vice chair of the firm and the co-chair of its global litigation practice, as a friend, having worked on the same side in pharmaceutical product liability litigation. Fraser's departure from the FDA comes three months after his boss, Stacy Cline Amin, the former FDA chief counsel during the Trump administration, joined Morrison & Foerster as the co-leader of its FDA regulatory and compliance practice. Amin started that role in June. Fraser's arrival at Greenberg Traurig comes a day after the firm announced it had recruited John Houghton, the former global co-chair of Latham's restructuring and special situations practice and its former European head of the same practice. Houghton is now chair of Greenberg Traurig's London restructuring and bankruptcy practice.

U.S. to invest $3 bln in COVID-19 vaccine supply chain -White House official,2087,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. plans to invest $3 billion in the vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position itself as a leading supplier of vaccines for the world, a top U.S. health official said on Thursday. The funding, which will begin to be distributed in the coming weeks, will focus on manufacturers of the inputs used in COVID-19 vaccine production as well as facilities that fill and package vaccine vials, White House COVID adviser Jeffrey Zients said during a news conference. ""The investments we are making, the $3 billion, are in U.S. companies that will expand their capacity for critical supplies,"" Zients said. He added that areas of focus will include lipids, bioreactor bags, tubing, needles, syringes, and personal protective equipment. The White House has not yet selected specific companies to receive the funds. U.S. demand for COVID-19 vaccines remains high as the White House prepares to begin offering a third booster shot to Americans later this month, pending a regulator greenlight. The United States also plans to give hundreds of millions of shots to other countries during the remainder of the year. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci added that he would not be surprised if a third dose became standard for COVID-19 vaccines that originally were expected to require two shots. U.S. cases of COVID-19 have surged to a seven-day average of more than 150,000 per day, up from less than 10,000 in June, according to federal data, as the contagious new Delta variant continues to circulate. The daily average of COVID-19 deaths has risen this week to more than 950 from around 900 last week, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said. Fauci downplayed concerns about a new COVID-19 variant known as Mu, or B.1.621, that some scientists are concerned could be resistant to vaccines. ""Even when you have variants that do diminish somewhat the efficacy of vaccines, the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that type,"" Fauci said.

Plea hearing scheduled for 'QAnon Shaman' facing Jan. 6 riot charges,1839,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The federal judge hearing the case of the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot defendant known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" has scheduled a plea hearing for Friday, according to a court filing and the defendant's lawyer. In a news release, Albert Watkins, lawyer for the ""Shaman,"" confirmed that a hearing had been set for Friday morning ""for the horn donning, fur wearing, tattoo chested, Jacob Chansley,"" which is the defendant's real name. Court records show that Chansley faces six charges, including civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding. As of Thursday, records do not indicate which specific charge or charges to which Chansley intends to plead guilty. He had been a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory that casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals. In his news release, Watkins asserted that Chansley, whom he previously acknowledged had been found by prison officials to be suffering from mental disorders, now ""has repudiated the ‘Q’ previously assigned to him and requests future references to him be devoid of use of the letter ‘Q’.” Watkins said that in the months since the riot Chansley, who has been held in pretrial detention, had charted a difficult path involving ""pain, depression, solitary confinement, introspection, recognition of mental health vulnerabilities, and a coming to grips with the need for more self-work."" Chansley is one of the most recognizable of the hundreds of Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 after the then-president in a fiery speech falsely claimed that his November election defeat was the result of fraud.

"U.S. House to vote on abortion bill, faces tough path in Senate",2974,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives plans to debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping states from enacting tough anti-abortion regulations like the one in Texas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday, but the bill's prospects in the Senate were slim. Declaring that the Texas statute ""delivers catastrophe to women in Texas, particularly women of color and women from low-income communities,"" Pelosi said in a statement that a Democratic bill would be brought before the full House after Sept. 20, when its recess is scheduled to end. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters President Joe Biden will consult with lawmakers on legislation to protect women's right to abortions. She said a range of approaches were under review, including the bill to be voted upon by the House. It was unclear whether the Senate would bring up such a bill even if it is passed by the House, however. It would face a difficult path in the 100-member chamber, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris having the power to break tie votes. Most legislation requires the support of at least 60 lawmakers to advance in the Senate. The House Democrats' measure, the Women's Health Protection Act, would likely struggle to get 10 votes among Republicans. Most Republicans oppose abortion, one of the most divisive issues in the United States, and many have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark decision making it a woman's constitutional right. The Women's Health Protection Act has been introduced in Congress multiple times since 2013 but never advanced in either the House or Senate. The issue took on renewed urgency for Democrats after a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling late on Wednesday allowing a Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion to remain in force. read more The bill aims to protect health care providers’ ability to deliver abortion services free from restrictions such as waiting periods, admitting privilege requirements for providers, or what supporters argue are unnecessary medical procedures, like ultrasounds, before an abortion can be performed. The Texas law and the Supreme Court's initial reaction to it could motivate Democratic voters to turn out in elections in November 2022, which Republicans are hoping will allow them to take control of the House and Senate. With such a tenuous hold on the two chambers, a number of Democrats want to change the 60-vote ""filibuster"" rule in the Senate so that bills could advance now with a simple majority of 51 lawmakers.

Transgender insureds can sue over health plan exclusion - 4th Circ,2243,"(Reuters) - Transgender people who are enrolled in the North Carolina State Health Plan can proceed with a lawsuit over its 2018 decision to exclude all coverage for gender dysphoria counseling, hormone therapy, surgical care or other treatment, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Wednesday. The 2-1 decision affirmed a federal judge in Greensboro’s 2020 ruling that NCSHP lacks sovereign immunity from the suit, which was filed by Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund, the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, and Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis on behalf of seven state workers or their dependents under the antidiscrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act. NCSHP waived its 11th Amendment protections against the discrimination lawsuit by accepting federal funds, Chief Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the majority. He quoted from the Civil Rights Remedies Equalization Act (CRREA), which provides that states have no sovereign immunity from suits alleging a violation of “the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.” Circuit Judge Albert Diaz concurred in the result, specifying that he did so based on the combined effect of CRREA and the Affordable Care Act rather than the ACA’s antidiscrimination section alone. The dissenter, Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee, said a state’s waiver of sovereign immunity must be knowing and voluntary, and CRREA – which predates the Affordable Care Act, and never mentions it – fails to provide the requisite notice. “The NCSHP’s sovereign immunity from suit should have been confirmed and the case dismissed,” Agee concluded. “The Supreme Court should proceed expeditiously to correct the constitutional error here.” The case is Maxwell Kadel et al. v. North Carolina State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees et al., 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1409.

"Missing Jan. 6 defense lawyer is recovering from illness, judge is told",1980,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - A lawyer who recently disappeared from public view while representing 17 defendants facing charges related to the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot was ""beginning to feel better"" but also ""very sick,"" a federal judge was told on Thursday. At a status hearing for Peter Schwartz, an Owensboro, Kentucky, man facing 14 riot-related charges, including felonies, Ryan Marshall, an associate of John Pierce, the lawyer who represents Schwartz and 16 other riot defendants, said he spoke to Pierce on Tuesday evening and the absent lawyer said he was ""beginning to feel better."" But Marshall said he then spoke to a friend of Pierce on Wednesday who told him Pierce remained ""very sick"" and had spent most of Wednesday asleep. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said that because Marshall was not a lawyer, if necessary the court would appoint a lawyer to temporarily represent Schwartz if Pierce's health status remains unclear. Prosecutors have cited conflicting news reports about Pierce's health problems. Some reports said Pierce had contracted COVID-19. An NPR reporter said last week that a friend of Pierce's told him Pierce did not have COVID-19 but was hospitalized due to ""dehydration and exhaustion."" That same reporter on Thursday said another source told him Pierce contracted COVID-19 but was not on a ventilator. Among the Jan. 6 riot defendants Pierce represents are members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups. Pierce also has represented Rudy Giuliani, former President Donald Trump's former lawyer, and Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old facing homicide charges stemming from protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Prosecutors have alleged that during the Jan 6 riot, Pierce's client Schwartz violently ""assaulted multiple law enforcement officers by spraying them with a chemical agent believed to be pepper spray.""

Greece offers unvaccinated health care workers a second chance to get the shot,1875,"ATHENS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Greece on Thursday offered unvaccinated health care workers a second chance to get a shot against COVID-19 and allow those who have been already suspended to return to work as hundreds of them protested against mandatory vaccination. Greece has suspended from their jobs nearly 6,000 frontline health care workers who missed a Sept. 1 deadline to get at least one vaccine shot, a government official told Reuters. Hundreds of those workers staged a five-hour work stoppage on Thursday and took to the streets in Athens and other Greek cities for a second time in less than a month to protest against the new rule. A labour union official for hospital workers POEDIN said that a total of 10,000 unvaccinated staff could be suspended, disrupting operations at understaffed Greek hospitals at a time when infections remained high and were likely to rise further. ""We have worked so hard during the pandemic and this is what we get,"" said protester Anna Haritou, who worked as a midwife at an Athens hospital until she was suspended on Wednesday. Attempting to ease any fallout, the government on Thursday said legislation would be amended to allow workers be removed from suspension and get back to their jobs immediately as long as they got the first dose in the coming days. A key condition is that they conclude their vaccination. ""Mandatory vaccination for the workers of the NHS (National Health System) was legislated to help safeguarding public health,"" health minister Thanos Plevris said on Thursday. ""Since we do not intend to punish (people), we will introduce an amendment."" About 53 percent of the Greek population is fully vaccinated and authorities hope to bring that figure up to 70 percent by the autumn. Greece on Thursday reported 2,840 new coronavirus daily cases and 33 deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Italy may eventually make COVID vaccine shots compulsory for all, Draghi says",2180,"ROME, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Italy may eventually make COVID-19 inoculations compulsory for everyone of eligible age, and plans to start administering booster vaccine shots later this month to vulnerable people, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Thursday. The government has already made it mandatory for medical workers to get vaccinated if they want to be paid, but Draghi said everyone may be obliged to get a shot when EU health authorities give full approval to the vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given conditional approval to four vaccines. This could be upgraded to so-called standard marketing authorisation after further checks, at which point, Draghi said, they could become compulsory for all. Such a move would likely spark fierce opposition in a country that has seen a rise in scepticism about all kinds of vaccines over the past decade and where health experts who have promoted inoculations have faced verbal abuse and threats from No Vax opponents. Draghi denounced these attacks, telling a news conference that ""such violence is particularly odious and cowardly when it is directed against those ... in the front line of the fight against the pandemic"". The prime minister told reporters he was confident that 80% of all Italians aged 12 and over would be fully vaccinated by the end of the month, against 70.5% at present. He added that his government was planning to further extend the usage of so-called Green Pass health documents, which are currently needed for long-distance travel, access to many leisure activities and are also obligatory for school workers. read more Officials said last week they were considering extending the scheme to anyone working in a public office or a supermarket. The system has triggered protests by some Italians who say it tramples on freedoms. Some 129,352 people have died of coronavirus in Italy since the pandemic hit last year, the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain. New cases held relatively steady in August, but doctors fear the more contagious Delta variant could cause a fresh spike in infections in the coming weeks. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. labor market powers ahead as weekly jobless claims fall, layoffs hit 24-year low",5799,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market was charging ahead even as new COVID-19 infections surge. The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls tumbling to a 17-month low in the third week of August. Declining layoffs should help to ease concerns about the economy even if August's closely watched employment report on Friday shows a slowdown in nonfarm payrolls growth. ""Regardless of tomorrow's report, keep in mind that the weekly jobless figures say the labor market screws continue to tighten,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There is no sign that the Delta variant is leading to job losses across the country."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 for the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of coronavirus cases. There were notable declines in applications in California, Illinois and Virginia, while Ohio and Missouri reported big increases. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 345,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. The latest wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, and an acute shortage of workers have left some economists expecting moderate job gains in August. Labor market indicators last month were mixed, with a measure of factory employment contracting and private payrolls undershooting expectations. But hiring by small businesses accelerated and consumers' views of the labor market remained fairly upbeat. read more Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index (.SPX) touching a record high. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. WORKER SHORTAGES While last week's claims data has no bearing on August's employment report as it falls outside the survey period, applications trended lower last month. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 160,000 to 2.748 million in the week ended Aug. 21, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs last month after rising by 943,000 in July. ""We expect the jobs report to show that the economy continued to add jobs at a rapid pace in August, defying COVID-19 Delta variant outbreaks across the country,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. That optimism was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers decreased 17% to 15,723 in August, the lowest number since June 1997. So far this year, employers have announced 247,326 job cuts, down 87% compared to the same period last year. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. But soaring COVID-19 cases could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. The claims report showed about 12.2 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-August. This number is expected to drop sharply after next Monday's expiration of government programs, which will affect about 7.5 million people. About 25 states led by Republican governors terminated the expanded benefits several months ago. Those steps did not lead to an increase in hiring, leaving some economists to caution against expectations for an increase in the labor pool. ""Many states already have ended the programs ahead of the federal expiration but so far we have yet to see clear changes associated with the ends of these programs in many of the different variables we have studied,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The labor market recovery is gaining steam despite a slowdown in economic activity caused by the latest coronavirus wave, fading fiscal stimulus and supply constraints. As a result of the expiration of the expanded benefits, weekly unemployment checks for nearly 3.0 million people will be reduced by $300, which economists say will hurt consumer spending. But the moderation in growth is likely to be mitigated by a shrinking trade deficit. The trade gap narrowed 4.3% to $70.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday. Economists have sharply marked down their gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter to a low as a 2.9% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter. ""The slowdown is not broad-based and primarily reflects payback from stimulus spending and ongoing supply issues,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

Philippines' Duterte says medical supplies not overpriced,1692,"MANILA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday denied allegations that medical supplies like personal protective equipment and face masks were overpriced, lashing out at lawmakers probing government officials over emergency purchases last year. The firebrand leader remains popular in the Philippines, but his administration is facing growing criticism over its handling of one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia. ""At the height of the pandemic, when it began, we had nothing,"" Duterte said in a weekly late-night national address. ""It was costly because of lack of supply."" Opposition lawmakers questioned the government's emergency deals to buy medical supplies from a lowly-capitalised company with links to government officials. In budget hearings, health ministry officials were grilled on unspent pandemic funds. State auditors have flagged ""deficiencies"" in more than $1 billion in COVID-19 funds. ""Senate, do not investigate programmes which are ongoing. You will derail it by your incessant penchant for investigating government offices,"" Duterte said. With 2 million confirmed infections and 33,680 deaths, the Philippines has the second highest number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia. Surging cases driven by the Delta variant are overwhelming hospitals, while healthcare workers have protested to end to what they called government neglect and unpaid benefits. Duterte, who is banned by the constitution from seeking re-election, plans to run as vice president next year. Critics see it as an effort to extend his power.

S.Africa's Aspen seeks licence for J&J COVID shot as EU shipments halted,3255,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Aspen Pharmacare (APNJ.J) said on Thursday it was in talks to make Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) coronavirus shot under licence in South Africa, at what would be the continent's first major independent distribution base for a global vaccine against COVID-19. News of the talks coincided with the suspension of heavily criticised shipments to Europe from Africa of the same shot, which is already being made under contract and packaged by Aspen but distributed by J&J. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last month he was ""stunned"" by that arrangement, since Europe has very high inoculation rates while less than 3% of Africa's adults have been vaccinated. read more Aspen CEO Stephen Saad told Reuters it was now seeking a far bigger deal with J&J that would allow it to make, market and sell the vaccine under licence for the whole of Africa, along the lines of the model used by India's Serum Institute. ""At the moment we contract manufacture for J&J. So that's what we do. We take it, they release it,"" Saad said in an interview. ""...But a licence would be different. We would then sell to the end-customer. And then we have a brand. And then we also have control over where our product goes"" and over pricing. ""...At the moment, J&J could take all the product we make because it's their product, and sell it ...wherever they choose to. We have no say in that."" J&J said in a statement that it was talking to Aspen ""to evaluate the further expansion of capacity at Aspen's vaccine manufacturing facility to enable increased COVID-19 vaccine production, including a possible license for Africa"". RAMAPHOSA INTERVENTIONS In an online briefing, African Union (AU) coronavirus envoy Strive Masiyiwa said the arrangement whereby J&J was sending shots finished in Africa to Europe was halted following interventions by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The fewer than 20 million doses shipped so far would be returned. ""All the vaccines produced at Aspen will stay in Africa and will be distributed to Africa,"" Masiyiwa said. Africa aims to vaccinate 60% of its adult population by 2022. But by August, just 10% of the doses that the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, co-run by the WHO, had forecast it would ship there by that time had been delivered, according to the AU. read more Masiyiwa said the talks between J&J and Aspen also came as a result of the South African president requesting that the arrangement between them be changed. Aspen is looking to expand annual vaccine production capacity from around 300 million doses to about 450 million by February 2022. Saad said it was too early to say whether some of that would be reserved for production under licence, though from October onwards, all of the J&J vaccine doses being packaged at its plant would go to African countries. J&J has contracts to supply 31 million doses of vaccine to South Africa and at least 220 million to the rest of Africa. The new arrangement would be ""like (India's) Serum where they get the licenses to manufacture. It's not a foreign model,"" Saad said of the licensing talks.

Number of people with dementia set to jump 40% to 78 mln by 2030 -WHO,2283,"GENEVA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - More than 55 million people worldwide are living with dementia, a neurological disorder that robs them of their memory and costs the world $1.3 trillion a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday. The progressive condition can be caused by stroke, brain injury or Alzheimer's disease. With populations ageing, the number of sufferers is projected to rise to 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050, the WHO said in a report. Only one in four countries has a national policy in place to support dementia patients and their families, it said, urging governments to step up to the public health challenge. ""Dementia robs millions of people of their memories, independence and dignity, but it also robs the rest of us of the people we know and love,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. ""The world is failing people with dementia, and that hurts all of us,"" he said. Health ministers agreed in 2015 on a global action plan, including early diagnosis and providing care, but are falling short on meeting targets by 2025, it said. ""Dementia truly is a global public health concern and not just in high-income countries. In fact, over 60% of people with dementia live in low- and middle-income countries,"" Katrin Seeher, an expert in WHO's department of mental health, told a news briefing. Medication, hygiene products and household adjustments for dementia patients are more accessible in wealthy countries, which have a greater level of reimbursement than in lower-income countries, the report said. Dementia affects memory, orientation, learning capacity, language, judgement, and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Seeher noted that dementia can also affect people aged below 65, with so-called young-onset dementia accounting for around 10% of all dementia cases. But developing dementia is not inevitable and some risk factors can be reduced, by controlling hypertension, diabetes, diet, depression, and the use of alcohol and tobacco, the WHO said. ""These are the things that we can do to promote our brain health and decrease the cognitive decline and the risk for dementia. These are things that can be started at a younger age,"" said WHO expert Tarun Dua. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Get vaccinated, French pupils told as they go back to school",2367,"PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Twelve million French children, who returned to school from their summer break on Thursday, wearing masks, were told by head teachers and President Emmanuel Macron that they should get vaccinated against COVID-19. Only about 47% of 12-to-17-year-olds are fully vaccinated, a concern for the spread of the coronavirus in general - and for how long classes can remain open. ""You need to keep getting vaccinated, and you need, even if I know it's a bit unpleasant, to continue wearing a mask in the classroom, wash your hands and keep your distance,"" Macron told French kids in a video posted on social media. He visited a classroom in Marseille, where he chatted with children - with one asking him if nasal swabs for COVID-19 go all the way into the brain. In the Rodin high school in central Paris, there was the same pro-vaccination message. ""I encourage you to get vaccinated, with the two doses, so that we can have a good year, all together. That's the objective,"" school principal Julie Bouvry told pupils as they arrived for their first day back. Vaccination is not mandatory. ""It's their choice,"" Bouvry said in an interview, but she stressed that if a non-vaccinated pupil is in contact with someone who has contracted the virus, they will need to stay home. ""It's not a satisfactory situation for them, nor for us."" Eleven-year-old Rodin pupil Louise - who admitted to being a bit nervous for her first day at a big school - said she couldn't wait to be old enough to get her dose. ""I really want to get vaccinated,"" she said. ""We have to do that (be vaccinated) so that we're not all at home in front of the computer as was planned before, so that's even better,"" 15-year-old Aliocha Affaticati said. The pandemic has meant significant changes for the likes of Matthieu Seguin, deputy director of the Rodin school. ""This is very different from usual,"" he said, spelling out safety measures that include air purifiers in classrooms, spare masks for any pupils who had forgotten theirs and hand sanitizer available everywhere. France, where the daily average COVID-19 contagion rate has slowed, is battling a fourth wave of the pandemic, and the government aims to administer a third vaccination to some 18 million people by early 2022, a health ministry official said on Tuesday.

German firms seek details of employees' vaccine status,2613,"BERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The German government is looking into whether it could temporarily ease data privacy rules to allow companies to find out whether their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19, ministers said on Wednesday. Many countries are making vaccination mandatory for healthcare staff and public sector workers and some companies - particularly in the United States - have started demanding that employees are inoculated. But Germany has tough laws regulating data privacy because of its history of Nazi and Communist state surveillance of citizens, meaning that companies have no right to find out about health issues relating to their staff. German businesses have been pushing to be able to ask staff about vaccination and the government is trying to get more people to get the shots as infections rise again. Almost 61% of the population has had both shots and 65% at least one. The cabinet agreed on Wednesday that companies must allow their employees time off to get vaccinated and said companies deciding on protective measures could take into account the vaccination status of their staff, if they knew it. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the government was looking into the question of whether companies could be allowed to ask about vaccination, particularly for jobs he described as vulnerable. He said there were difficult discussions within the coalition government on the issue, particularly between Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, from the Social Democrats (SPD), and Health Minister Jens Spahn from the Christian Democrats. Heil told ARD television he knew that many employees were also interested in knowing the vaccination status of their colleagues, but the law means that employers cannot ask for it. ""Health data of employees is particularly sensitive,"" Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht, also from the SPD, told the Funke media group, but added that granting employers the right to that information might be possible in risky workplaces. Heil said pragmatic solutions were needed, for example in hospitals or prisons. Exemptions to privacy laws have already been made to allow restaurants to reopen, with staff and customers required to show that they are vaccinated, cured or test negative. Several thousand people marched through the streets of Berlin on Saturday and Sunday in unauthorised protests against coronavirus vaccinations and restrictions. The country reported 13,531 new cases on Wednesday and 23 fatalities, bringing the total number of cases to more than 3.9 million and the death toll to 92,223.

Vietnam PM warns of long coronavirus fight as crisis deepens,2010,"HANOI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Vietnam could be facing a lengthy battle against the coronavirus and cannot rely on lockdown and quarantine measures indefinitely, its prime minister said, as the country struggles to contain its deadliest outbreak so far. Vietnam has deployed soldiers and forced residents of its biggest city to stay in their homes in recent weeks, in its most drastic measures yet to fight an outbreak that has shattered what was one of the world's best containment records. ""We cannot resort to quarantine and lockdown measures forever, as it will cause difficulty for the people and the economy,"" Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said late Wednesday. Aggressive contact tracing and quarantine procedures in the country of 98 million people had succeeded in keeping the virus under control for over a year, but the highly contagious Delta variant has hit Vietnam hard. Total cases jumped from just a few thousand in late April to 480,000 at present, with more than 12,000 deaths, with Ho Chi Minh City by far the worst hit. Authorities reported 13,197 infections and 271 fatalities on Thursday. Restrictions were causing ""material and mental hardship,"" Chinh said while meeting experts to hear ideas on fighting the virus. The measures have also forced companies in labour-intensive businesses, including suppliers for brands like Nike (NKE.N) and Adidas (ADSGn.DE), to suspend operations. Vietnam's industrial output in August fell 7.4% from a year earlier, while its exports dropped 5.4%. Retail sales of goods and services plunged 33.7%, according to official figures. Chinh said preventing deaths was top priority and vaccinations were a key strategic measure. Just 2.9% of Vietnam's population have been inoculated, while its fatality rate of 2.5% is higher than the global rate of 2.1%, according to the health ministry. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving in a complicated and unpredictable manner and may last for a long time,"" Chinh said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
South African train brings COVID-19 vaccines closer to people,2454,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - At Springs train station in South Africa's biggest city Johannesburg, Simphiwe Dyantyi and her partner wait their turn to board. But they are not going anywhere, instead they are getting COVID-19 jabs inside a stationary train. The initiative by South African state logistics firm Transnet is meant to bring vaccines closer to people and save them from travelling long distances as the government ramps up its COVID-19 vaccination drive. From the Springs station, the Transvaco train will in the first week of September move to rural Eastern Cape province. Once there, it will make stops in different places in the province, bringing relief to poor villagers who are often without basic health facilities. It will be stationed there until November. Dyantyi, 32, said the train had saved her a trip to the next vaccination centre where queues have been long since the government made vaccinations available to all adults last month.

South Africa has been battered by three coronavirus waves, infecting at least 2,770,575 million people, killing 81,830 - by far the continent's worst toll - and pummelling an already struggling economy with lockdowns and travel restrictions. South Africa has vaccinated more than 12 million people after its campaign got off to a slow start due to bureaucratic hiccups and a failure to start early talks with pharmaceutical companies, among other challenges. ""We are basically bringing the vaccines to the people,"" Paballo Mokoena, the train manager said.

"Kosovo to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines",1916,"PRISTINA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Kosovo government decided to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccines over their expired date of use as the country faces a sharp rise in the coronavirus death rate. The vaccines that will be destroyed were part of a donation from Norway with August 31 seen as an expiration date. The decision to destroy vaccines triggered criticism, with some people calling for the resignation of the health minister on the health ministry's Facebook page. Unwillingness to take vaccines, technical difficulties when attempting to make an appointment online and propaganda about harm from the vaccines had put Kosovo among the countries with the lowest vaccination rates in Europe at 15.7%. In the past seven days 157 people died in Kosovo of coronavirus infectionS, and more than 12,0000 new cases were registered among the country's 1.8 million population. New cases were attributed to gatherings such as weddings and a complete scrapping of restrictions. Starting from this week new restrictions are in place including a curfew from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m.. Thousands of Kosovars living abroad, mainly in Germany and Switzerland, who have spent holidays in Kosovo during the summer have reported as positive cases when they returned to western European countries. Kosovo’s Health Minister Arben Vitia said many people refused to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine following “misinformation” that the vaccines already have expired which made people stay away. In Kosovo people can choose between AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BionTech vaccines. But because of some reports on AstraZeneca vaccines, people mostly have chosen Pfizer/BionTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE).

Thai royalist turns protester as anti-government movement broadens,3850,"BANGKOK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Often seen at the wheel of one of his supercars, Thai ultra-royalist Tanat ""Nat"" Thanakitamnuay became a well-known face at demonstrations that ushered in Thailand's 2014 coup. Now he is back on the streets demanding the removal of coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister and reforms to the monarchy - a change of heart that points to the broadening of Thailand's latest anti-government movement. ""It's bad for your mental health to see an incompetent PM,"" said Nat, 29, who was blinded permanently in his right eye last month after being hit by a teargas canister at a protest. He switched sides in part because of anger over the government's widely-criticised handling of the latest coronavirus outbreak, which has brought severe economic hardship as well as nearly 12,000 deaths. That has given new life to a student-led protest movement that emerged last year with demands to limit the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy and remove Prayuth, a former army chief who seized power in 2014 after months of protests against the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra. After a lull due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings, demonstrations against Prayuth have gathered renewed steam in recent weeks. ""The protests have broadened due to COVID-19 and its economic consequences,"" Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of Ubon Ratchathani University's political science faculty, told Reuters. ""That prompted a more diverse group of people to join."" Defending the government's handling of the pandemic, Anucha Burapachaisri, deputy secretary to the prime minister, told Reuters that all necessary measures to contain the spread of infections had been taken. But a recent poll said fewer than 30% of people thought they could rely on the government of Prayuth, who rejects the accusations of opponents that he manipulated a 2019 election to keep power he had taken by force.

"Analysis: Texas abortion ban opens up 'Wild West' of enforcement, critics say",4742,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Texas's strict new abortion ban hands over the power of enforcement to private citizens - and offers them cash payments to do so - a unique construction that makes the law harder to block in court. That structure has alarmed both abortion providers, who said they feel like they now have prices on their heads, and legal experts who said citizen enforcement could have broad repercussions if it was used across the United States to address other contentious social issues. ""It is a little bit like the Wild West,"" said Harold Krent, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. He called it a throwback to early U.S. history when it was common to have privately enforced laws at a time when the government was limited and there was little organized law enforcement. The law, known as S.B. 8, bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. That is often before women realize they are pregnant and could effectively ban 85% to 90% of abortions, abortion rights campaigners said. Krent said the measure could be ripe for abuse because anyone can sue for any reason, without government officials exercising the kind of discretion they normally would over enforcing a law, Krent added. This feature creates all kinds of problems for abortion providers seeking to challenge the law, which went into effect on Wednesday. The Supreme Court late on Wednesday denied an application brought by a coalition that supports abortion rights seeking to put the law on hold. L1N2Q4097 Texas is the only one of 12 six-week abortion bans that has gone into effect. Others were routinely blocked by lower courts as a violation of Supreme Court precedent - including the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - guaranteeing the right to an abortion, especially at an early stage of pregnancy. The challenges facing abortion providers in Texas are two-fold. 'VIGILANTE' SYSTEM First, the law sets up what critics have called a ""vigilante"" system in which any Texas resident can sue an abortion provider or anyone who aids and abets someone seeking to obtain an abortion. If they win, they could get a bounty of at least $10,000, which would come out of the pockets of the defendants. The mere threat of litigation has prompted abortion clinics in Texas to immediately limit their abortion services in compliance with the law. There are other laws that have provisions that allow private citizens to enforce them, including various environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, as well as statutes that encourage whistleblowers to report fraud and abuse within the government. But these laws do not give people the power to sue to prevent someone else exercising a right recognized by the Supreme Court. The way the law has written also makes it difficult for abortion rights campaigners to challenge it. In the current litigation, lawyers for the state have countered that the abortion rights campaigners' ""own litigation decisions, not some injustice foisted upon them"" are to blame for their failure to block the measure. They say, for example, that the challengers waited too long to file their lawsuit. Legal experts say that abortion providers could likely succeed in winning lawsuits on an individual basis but face barriers in blocking it statewide, In the current case, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals canceled a lower court hearing to consider whether the law should be put on hold in part because of the complex legal questions raised. One risky way abortion providers could seek to challenge the law is to continue to provide abortions after six weeks, thereby inviting a lawsuit, said Vikram Amar, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. Then, they could argue that the law is unconstitutional and ""hope that a state court decides to follow existing Supreme Court precedent and declare the state law invalid,"" he added. If the law remains in place, abortion providers expect other states to enact similar measures. It could also prompt states to consider similarly structured laws aimed at people exercising rights that state officials - whether they be Republicans or Democrats - frown upon. ""You can spin out hypothetical after hypothetical about any individual right that a state could undermine,"" said Marc Hearron, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights who represents the challengers. ""That's why I think everyone from all sides ... ought to be extremely concerned."" As for those providing abortions, Dr. Anuj Khattar, a doctor from Washington state who flies to Texas to provide abortions, believes the law will have a chilling effect. ""I feel like there's a bounty on my head and I don’t want play this game,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Kosovo to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines",1916,"PRISTINA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Kosovo government decided to destroy 133,000 AstraZeneca (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccines over their expired date of use as the country faces a sharp rise in the coronavirus death rate. The vaccines that will be destroyed were part of a donation from Norway with August 31 seen as an expiration date. The decision to destroy vaccines triggered criticism, with some people calling for the resignation of the health minister on the health ministry's Facebook page. Unwillingness to take vaccines, technical difficulties when attempting to make an appointment online and propaganda about harm from the vaccines had put Kosovo among the countries with the lowest vaccination rates in Europe at 15.7%. In the past seven days 157 people died in Kosovo of coronavirus infectionS, and more than 12,0000 new cases were registered among the country's 1.8 million population. New cases were attributed to gatherings such as weddings and a complete scrapping of restrictions. Starting from this week new restrictions are in place including a curfew from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m.. Thousands of Kosovars living abroad, mainly in Germany and Switzerland, who have spent holidays in Kosovo during the summer have reported as positive cases when they returned to western European countries. Kosovo’s Health Minister Arben Vitia said many people refused to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine following “misinformation” that the vaccines already have expired which made people stay away. In Kosovo people can choose between AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BionTech vaccines. But because of some reports on AstraZeneca vaccines, people mostly have chosen Pfizer/BionTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE). Vitia said that in the coming days Kosovo will receive 500,000 Pfizer/BionTech vaccines from the United States, and 250,000 AstraZeneca vaccines from Germany and Italy as donations.

CMC warns on profits as trading volumes ease after frenzy,1888,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - Online broker CMC (CMCX.L) cut its annual profit guidance by up to 80 million pounds ($110 million) on Thursday after market volatility eased from extreme levels earlier in the pandemic, triggering a 27% fall in its share price. CMC, which lets investors trade complex financial instruments on its platforms, said overall market activity had been subdued over the last couple of months, leading to lower trading volumes across new and existing clients. The company's stock dived 27% to its lowest in more than a year on the London Stock Exchange by 1000 GMT, heading for its worst day since late 2016. ""CMC cannot escape the slowdown in trading activity,"" Peel Hunt analysts wrote in a note. Among reasons for the drop, it cited clients taking holidays after the easing of pandemic curbs, meaning they have less money to spend on investing as well as less time. CMC and the broader sector profited from high volumes as fears over the economic impact of the health crisis spurred volatility, while a so-called ""GameStonk"" retail trading frenzy on Wall Street during the lockdowns also aided. Activity has slowed as government support measures and vaccinations mitigated concerns about a prolonged economic slowdown. The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), or Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to 16 from a peak of 85 last year. CMC, which had expected more than 330 million pounds in net operating income for its fiscal year through March, now says it will be between 250 million and 280 million pounds. Client numbers remain up around a third from pre-pandemic numbers, while assets under management are near record levels, the company said. Operating costs for the current year will be moderately higher, although they will be partly offset by lower marketing costs because of lower activity, CMC added.

Facemasks and sanitizer as French kids go back to school,1260,"PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Twelve million French children headed back to school on Thursday, wearing facemasks, using sanitizer at the entrance and standing distanced from each other in the yard under strict government rules aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.

Stars return to Venice red carpet as film festival opens,3263,"VENICE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Decked out in a black and white Chanel gown, Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz led the comeback of movie stars to the red carpet of the Venice film festival on its opening night on Wednesday, as cinema hopes to shake off the gloom of the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike rival Cannes, the world's oldest film festival did not skip the 2020 edition due to the health crisis but it is only this year that celebrities are returning in force to the Lido waterfront, in a show of support for an industry hammered by lockdowns. Organisers are banking on a strict anti-COVID protocol to help keep the 11-day movie marathon trouble free. Theatres are operating at half capacity and a wall blocks the view to the red carpet to stop crowds from gathering outside the main venue. Face masks and a health pass or a negative COVID test are required to attend screenings, and there will be fewer late-night parties. ""They are taking measures really seriously. Everyone is being really careful, really responsible. I think it's great for the industry that things can start to come back,"" Cruz told Reuters ahead of the opening ceremony. ""I am happy that it's happening. It's a celebration of cinema but it also gives jobs to a lot of people around the world."" Cruz stars in ""Parallel Mothers"", the festival's opening film by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Hollywood stars Kirsten Dunst, Timothee Chalamet, Matt Dillon and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also among those who have made the trip to Venice so far.

He said most of the world premieres to be screened at the festival were already sold out, and promised that there would be no shortage of celebrities - even though fans will not be able to get anywhere near them. ""The red carpet will be one of the most crowded in years because everybody is here,"" he said. Titles vying for the Golden Lion award for best film include Jane Campion's ""The Power of the Dog"", with Benedict Cumberbatch as a ranch owner who torments a young widow played by Dunst, and Kristen Stewart's turn as Princess Diana in ""Spencer"". Also in the main line-up is Gyllenhaal with her debut as director, of ""The Lost Daughter"", based on an Elena Ferrante novel and starring Olivia Colman and Dakota Johnson. Ridley Scott's medieval epic ""The Last Duel"" starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and Denis Villeneuve's hotly anticipated science-fiction tale ""Dune"", with Chalamet and Zendaya, will both screen out of competition. The festival is a showcase for Oscar contenders as awards season approaches, and South Korean ""Parasite"" director Bong Joon-ho - who presides over the jury - said he was ready for a fight with fellow jury members to pick the award winners. ""As a film-maker I don't believe cinema can be stopped so easily. COVID will pass, cinema will continue,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"U.S. FDA seeks new warnings on arthritis drugs from Pfizer, Lilly and AbbVie",1992,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator has asked Pfizer (PFE.N), Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) and AbbVie (ABBV.N) to include information about the risks of serious conditions and death from the use of their drugs that belong to a class of treatments known as JAK inhibitors. The warnings on Wednesday stem from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's review of Pfizer's arthritis drug Xeljanz after initial results from a February trial showed an increased risk of serious heart-related problems and cancer with the drug. AbbVie shares closed down 7%, while Pfizer and Eli Lilly were slightly lower. Pfizer said the update would bring important clarity for healthcare providers on the risk/benefit profile of Xeljanz. JAK inhibitors like Xeljanz block inflammation-causing enzymes, known as Janus kinases, and target autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. The FDA said Lilly's drug Olumiant and AbbVie's Rinvoq have similar operating mechanisms, leading to the possibility of risks seen in the Xeljanz safety trial. ""Based on available data across approved and investigational indications, we remain confident in the positive benefit-risk profile of Olumiant,"" Lilly said.

Azarenka calls for mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations,2492,"NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka moved into the U.S. Open third round with a 6-3 7-6 (1) win over Italy's Jasmine Paolini on Wednesday, saying she was happy to be back playing in front of crowds at Flushing Meadows, especially vaccinated fans. Azarenka made it to the final last year before losing to Naomi Osaka but did it in empty stadiums as COVID-19 restrictions barred spectators from the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. This year the fans are back but only those who have proof of vaccination and the 18th-seeded Belarusian admitted confusion over why the rules do not extend to players as well. ""It was great to be back playing in front of fans and mostly vaccinated,"" said the twice Australian Open champion, who pulled out of a WTA Tour event in April because it coincided with her scheduled COVID-19 vaccination. ""To me that's a bit bizarre that fans have to be vaccinated and players are not. ""So I think that in my opinion, it's inevitable that it will be mandated at some point, like other leagues are doing. ""I don't see the point of stalling it, because I think we all want to be safe, we all want to continue doing our jobs."" The New York City mayor's office last week mandated proof of vaccine to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the major puts on its prime time matches. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) then elected to extend the vaccine requirement to all attendees aged 12 or older entering the sprawling facility. Both the WTA and ATP has urged players to get vaccinated but some have expressed reservations and declared the decision a freedom of choice. World number three Stefanos Tsitsipas said he would only get the COVID-19 vaccine if it became mandatory to compete in tennis, drawing a sharp rebuke from the Greek government. World number one Novak Djokovic, who is bidding to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam at the U.S. Open, said in April he hoped the COVID-19 vaccine would not become mandatory for players and has declined to answer questions regarding his own vaccination status. ""I respect everybody's opinion as long as it's not conspiracy theory,"" said Azarenka, a three-times U.S. Open runner-up. ""If you actually have decent knowledge and looked into research and have your facts and stats and research, that's a different conversation.

Bulgaria imposes new restrictions to curb surge in COVID cases,1499,"SOFIA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Restaurants and bars in Bulgaria will have to close at 10 p.m. from Sept. 7, while indoor sports competitions will be held without spectators, the health minister said on Thursday, as the Balkan country braces for a surge of new coronavirus infections. Bulgaria, the least vaccinated country against the coronavirus in the European Union, has seen a spike in infections in recent weeks, mostly of the highly infectious Delta variant. On Thursday alone the country of 7 million people registered some 1,745 new cases, bringing its tally of active infections to some 32,192. Some 18,950 people have died since the beginning of the pandemic, with 54 more deaths reported on Thursday in the country with the highest mortality rate in the European Union, figures from Our World in Data showed. ""There is no place for panic. The situation is serious, but not out of control. The low percentage of vaccinations forces us to impose these measures,"" interim Health Minister Stoicho Katsarov told reporters. He appealed again for Bulgarians to get vaccinated. Under the new restrictions, which will be in force until the end of October, music festivals will be banned, while cinemas and theatres will have to operate at 50% capacity. Students will be allowed to attend classes when the school year begins on Sept. 15, Katsarov said, but he warned that if the infections continue to rise, they may have to switch to online studies.

Thailand cites positive results from Sinovac-AstraZeneca vaccine formula,2024,"BANGKOK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Thailand's health ministry said on Thursday that its COVID-19 vaccine regimen of China's Sinovac (SVA.O) followed by British-developed AstraZeneca (AZN.L) was safe and successfully boosted immunity among its first 1.5 million recipients. Thailand in July became the first country in the world to mix a Chinese vaccine and a Western-developed vaccine as cases and deaths in the country surged and the government struggled with vaccine supplies. ""The cross formula has been injected to over 1.5 million people and it is safe. Please don't say things that would create concern,"" senior health official Supakit Sirilak told a news conference. He said Thailand, which has been manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine, would no longer be giving two doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac. Just 13% of Thailand's population of over 66 million has been fully vaccinated. The majority of its 1.2 million infections and 12,103 coronavirus deaths came after April this year, brought on by the highly transmissible Alpha and Delta variants. The health ministry said the Sinovac-AstraZeneca combination boosted immunity to the same levels as two AstraZeneca shots and meant vaccinations could be completed faster due to the shorter dose gap. The formula will be used for most of Thailand's vaccinations, Public Health Permanent Secretary Kiatiphum Wongrajit said. Booster doses will be given to 3 million people who received two Sinovac shots, using a different type of vaccine, likely from this month, health minister Anutin Charnvirakul has said. Sinovac's inactivated virus vaccine has caused concern in some countries about its resistance to the Delta variant. Earlier this week during a censure debate on the coronavirus crisis, Anutin told lawmakers not to criticise Sinovac, to protect the Thai public and avoid harming ties with China. ""Tarnishing of the Sinovac vaccine by many (house) members may create panic, confusion and concern for the public,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Nigeria, Kenya and Niger will receive first shipments of the COVID-19 vaccines on Thursday, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) said.

Japanese PM's rival Kishida urges coronavirus stimulus package,3964,"TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Japan's former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who is challenging Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as ruling party chief, said on Thursday an economic stimulus package worth ""tens of trillions of yen"" was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Kishida also said Japan must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the pandemic-hit economy, offering the clearest sign to date that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies would remain in place if he replaced Suga. The winner of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race is all but assured to become premier given the party's majority in parliament's powerful lower chamber. ""Many countries are signalling that they will maintain expansionary fiscal and monetary policy steps for the time being. Japan must not fall behind,"" he told a news conference, shifting away from his prior remarks signalling the need to dial back the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose policy. Kishida also said that as party chief, he would aim to bring socio-economic activities back to near normalcy by early 2022, criticising the current handling of the pandemic as too little and too slow. Kishida said the stimulus package must be compiled ""swiftly"" and include cash payments to non-permanent workers and others who will be affected by steps to contain the flow of people. The party leader contest is slated for Sept. 29, and the government is considering a plan to hold the general election on Oct. 17. 'WORST-CASE SCENARIO' Late on Wednesday, Japan's minister for digital transformation became the first serving cabinet member to openly back Kishida. The move marked another turn in the rollercoaster week that saw the unpopular Suga come to the brink of calling a snap election on Tuesday night, only to deny the reports by Wednesday morning after party grandees, including his powerful predecessor Shinzo Abe, intervened to stop him. In a series of manoeuvres to cling on to his job, Suga is set to remove his unpopular long-term ally Toshihiro Nikai from a key LDP post. It is a part of a reshuffle expected next week that will likely bring several high-profile names to both party executive positions and Suga's cabinet as the premier strives to shore up his support. Kishida said Suga's coronavirus policies were fragmented and piecemeal and said the government should move with urgency. ""In crisis management, being more thorough in assuming the worst-case scenario, rather than believing enough has been done, is necessary,"" he said. Kishida laid out plans to set up a new government agency overseeing health crisis management, complete vaccinations by November, and to provide government aid for the development of oral drugs for COVID-19 treatment. ""I would have legislation revised so state and local governments have strong authority to curb people's movement and secure medical resources,"" Kishida said. When launching his candidacy last week, he said he wanted to reduce income gaps and support the economically vulnerable such as workers in insecure jobs and women, in contrast with Suga, who has stressed self-reliance before public support. ""Suga has been focused on helping businesses, such as aids for corporate loans. Kishida, by contrast, emphasises support for household income rather than companies,"" said Daiju Aoki, chief Japan economist at UBS SuMi TRUST Wealth Management. ""While both are calling for expansionary fiscal policies, this point is clearly different."" The low-key Kishida, 64, has ranked poorly in surveys of voters' preferred next premier, but the head of an LDP faction is now viewed as a promising rallying point for lawmakers seeking a new leader ahead of the lower house election. Suga, 72, took office last September with support of about 70% but his ratings have sunk to record lows below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections and many of his LDP lawmakers fear for their seats.

"India has most COVID-19 cases in two months, worst-hit Kerala in focus",2539,"BENGALURU, Sept 2 (Reuters) - India reported the biggest single-day rise in COVID-19 cases in two months on Thursday, as the government worries about the virus spreading from the most-affected Kerala state, schools reopening, and the start of the festival season. Densely populated Kerala, on India's southern tip, accounted for nearly 70% of the 47,092 new infections and a third of deaths, a week after it celebrated its biggest festival during which family and social gatherings were common. ""With cases rising in Kerala, adequate steps should be taken to contain the inter-state spread of COVID-19,"" Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in a statement after speaking with his state counterparts in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which border Kerala. He asked them to increase vaccination in the districts close to Kerala. India has so far administered 662 million doses, with at least one dose in 54% of its 944 million adults and the required two doses in 16%. Vaccinations have soared in recent days as supplies have improved. And as more than two-thirds of Indians already have COVID-fighting antibodies, mainly through natural infection, experts think another national surge in cases will be less deadly than the last one in April and May when tens of thousands of people died and hospitals ran out of beds and oxygen. Also offering hope is a recent non-peer-reviewed study done in Kerala that showed that one dose of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shot, the mainstay of India's immunisation drive, generates 30 times more antibodies in previously infected people than fully inoculated ones who never contracted the virus. ""A decently managed vaccination programme, along with the hybrid immunity we're seeing now, makes a massive third wave unlikely,"" said clinical immunologist and rheumatologist Padmanabha Shenoy, who led the study and was referring to the immunity from natural infection and one vaccine dose. The federal government, nevertheless, has warned that like in Kerala, the rest of India could also see a rise in infections around the festival season starting this month and ending in early November. Some parents are also worried about the reopening of physical classes - voluntary and mainly for middle school and above - in the capital Delhi and states like Gujarat. India has so far reported about 32.9 million infections, the most in the world after the United States. Deaths went up by 509 on Thursday to a total of 439,529, which experts say is a massive undercount. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand says fall in COVID-19 cases shows Delta lockdown working,1808,"WELLINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported a drop in new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, which authorities said was a sign that a nationwide lockdown was helping to limit spread of the infectious Delta variant. Barring a few cases in February, New Zealand had been largely free of coronavirus until the Delta outbreak prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order the snap lockdown last month. Authorities reported 49 new infections in the outbreak epicentre of Auckland, a fall from 75 on Wednesday, taking the tally to 736. ""The latest lower number is encouraging and does show that our alert level 4 lockdown is working, even against Delta,"" the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told a news conference. Of the 42 people in hospital infected with Delta, six were in intensive care units (ICU) and three on ventilation, he added. About 2 million people in the largest city of Auckland and the neighbouring Northland region remain in strict level 4 lockdown, but authorities have eased curbs elsewhere. ""Our case numbers are moving around ... that's not unusual,"" Ardern told the news conference. ""The important thing is we are seeing some positive trends."" Northland will drop to alert level 3 from midnight, Ardern said, bringing it in line with the rest of the country. Ardern's lockdowns and international border closure since March 2020 have been credited with reining in COVID-19, largely freeing up day-to-day activities from curbs. But the government faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population of 5.1 million has been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Australian doctors warn of risks to hospitals once COVID-19 curbs ease,2982,"SYDNEY, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Australian doctors on Thursday warned the country's hospitals are not ready to cope with the government's reopening plans, even with higher vaccination rates, as some states prepare to move from a virus suppression strategy to living with COVID-19. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) said the health system was in danger of being locked into a ""permanent cycle of crisis"" and has called for new modelling to check if staffing levels in hospitals can withstand an expected surge in cases when lockdown rules ease. ""If you have opened up and you haven't looked at the safety nets or the life rafts that we've got, we might end up actually trying to push more people on the life rafts and capsizing them,"" AMA Vice President Chris Moy told broadcaster ABC.

New South Wales on Thursday reported 1,288 new locally acquired cases, just below its pandemic high of 1,290 hit on Monday. Seven new deaths were recorded. A total of 957 people are in hospitals, up from 698 a week ago, while cases in intensive care units (ICU) jumped nearly 40% to 160, 64 of whom require ventilation. Authorities quadrupled the number of the state's intensive care ventilators to 2,000 early last year, but the medical association's Moy said governments need to focus on hospital staffing before relaxing lockdown rules.

"Helped by TSMC and Foxconn, BioNTech vaccines finally reach Taiwan",2929,"TAOYUAN, Taiwan, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The first batch of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, helped by the involvement of two of the world's most important tech firms after months of heated political and diplomatic wrangling. Taiwan has blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an original order from the German firm this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government then allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high-profile billionaire founder, Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the doses. A $350 million deal for 10 million shots was inked in July, which will be donated to the government for distribution. A cargo flight from Luxembourg carrying the vaccines landed at Taiwan's main international airport at Taoyuan, outside of Taipei, at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT), and was met on the tarmac by Health Minister Chen Shih-chung and Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation's chairwoman and Gou's cousin. Chen spoke briefly to thank the companies, and a Taiwanese Buddhist group that has also ordered 5 million doses, for their efforts to get the vaccine. ""They've worked very hard and overcome all the difficulties,"" he said. Chen did not mention Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (600196.SS), which has the right to sell the shots on BioNTech's behalf in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and whose unit signed the deal for the island's doses. A large label on the side of one of the crates with the names of BioNTech, Fosun and the vaccine, using simplified Chinese characters, which are not used in Taiwan, was removed before arrival. Fosun had posted a picture on its Weibo account of the crate in the warehouse, with the label, before it was loaded onto the aircraft. In another flourish of drama, China announced the exact arrival date of the vaccines on Wednesday, shortly before Chen began his daily news briefing. The roughly 900,000 doses of the vaccine, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), are expected to start being administered later this month. Taiwan is getting the shots earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order. More than 10 million vaccine doses have arrived in Taiwan to date, split between Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), while local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp's (6547.TWO) shots have also started to be administered.

South Korean health workers drop strike plans after agreement,1777,"SEOUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Korean frontline health workers on Thursday dropped plans to strike after they reached an agreement with the government on their demand for increased staffing and better work conditions during last-ditch negotiations overnight. The Korean Health and Medical Worker's Union had warned some of its 80,000 members, including nurses, medical engineers, and pharmacists who say they are exhausted from battling waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, would begin striking from Thursday if their demands were not met. read more Upon the union's request, the government agreed to establish at least four public infectious disease hospitals by 2024, draft a detailed nurse deployment guidelines per severity of COVID-19 patients by October, and expand funding to subsidise those treating contagious diseases to go into effect in January 2022. It has also agreed to establish a recommended nurse to patient ratio. The United States has a recommended ratio of 1:5 and Japan has 1:7 while South Korea has none. The union had argued its workers are often working double or triple shifts and need better pay and working hours. The government and the union have previously met for talks 12 times since May, including a 14-hour marathon session on Monday, but had not been able to find common ground. South Korea has fully inoculated 31.7% of its 52 million people, and 57.4% with at least one dose. The government wants 70% of its citizens to have had at least one shot by September. South Korea reported 1,961 new COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, raising the tally to 255,401, with 2,303 deaths.

Medics mount emergency response from devastated Louisiana hospital's parking lot,3246,"HOUMA, La., Sept 1 (Reuters) - Outside a hospital abandoned after Hurricane Ida tore its roof off and flooded the interior, emergency medical workers were ready for action. The Terrebonne General Health System building was desolate, its patients evacuated just before the storm came ashore at full strength about 50 miles (80 km) away on Sunday. But its parking lot was bustling. Two dozen ambulances were using it as a staging area for emergency calls across Terrebonne Parish and to move patients to other hospitals. ""They've asked us to be on site here near the ER because it's closed,"" said Donna Newchurch, who heads the Louisiana Ambulance Alliance. ""If people drive up and see the medical center is closed, we can transport them to another facility."" For medics sitting under the awning of a camper that supplied cool drinks and coffee, the days have been long. Their two ambulances stood ready, while more than 20 others were out on 911 calls that included breathing problems, traumatic injuries and women in labor. ""We have been running constantly,"" said Newchurch. ""All units have been all-hands-on-deck since Monday."" Most of Louisiana's hospitals escaped catastrophic damage from the storm, but two facilities in this parish of more than 110,000 residents were among the handful that weren't so lucky. read more Newchurch and her crews helped relocate about 144 patients from Terrebonne General to hospitals across the state over the weekend. After the storm passed on Monday, they evacuated about 46 patients from Chabert Medical Center, also in Houma, about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of New Orleans, she said. COVID TAXING HOSPITALS The storm hit as hospitals were crowded with COVID patients, cases of the Delta variant were surging and nurses were in short supply. Several of those evacuated from the Houma hospitals were critical care patients who were intubated and required assisted breathing. ""A lot of them had COVID as well, and hospitals are already full, so it made finding beds for them at other hospitals difficult,"" said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer of Pafford EMS. Governor John Bel Edwards said on Wednesday that 2,447 COVID patients were hospitalized across the state, 446 of them on ventilators. Like much of the state, Terrebonne Parish is largely without power and there is no reliable estimate of when electricity will be restored. ""When a hospital doesn't have electricity and water -- it's basically out of business,"" said Mart Black, spokesman for Terrebonne Parish. Black said the city is attempting to get a feeder line from Entergy (ETR.N) to get a power generator facility back. A water plant is working to restore service to the two area hospitals, he said. Officials at Ochsner Health System, which operates medical facilities across Louisiana, told reporters they were quickly reopening shuttered hospitals as power was restored, although 250 to 300 beds remain out of commission. Edwards has discussed setting up a makeshift medical unit in the parish for minor emergencies. ""People may step on nails or cut themselves,"" said Black. ""When we set this unit up, it can hopefully handle that, but serious stuff will have to go somewhere else."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Natasha Harrison steps down from Boies Schiller's leadership role,3257,"(Reuters) - Boies Schiller Flexner said on Wednesday that Natasha Harrison, a London-based lawyer who was seen to be next in line to take the reins from the firm's chair, famed trial lawyer David Boies, has stepped down from her role as deputy chair of the litigation firm. Harrison had been tapped as co-managing partner and one of Boies' likely successors in 2019, along with former partner Nicholas Gravante. She was elevated to the deputy chair post last December after Gravante decamped for Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. In a firmwide email obtained by Reuters, the firm's managing partners, and founders Boies and Jonathan Schiller, said ""a variety of professional and very personal factors"" that are largely tied to challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to Harrison's decision. ""International travel restrictions have prevented Natasha from spending the kind of time in the U.S., actively engaging with the leadership team, the Firm and our U.S.-based clients, that she feels is necessary to fulfill the obligations of the Deputy Chair position,"" the email said. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Boies said the firm has not appointed a successor for Harrison and will discuss whether there is a need for the deputy chair role. Harrison will remain one of the firm's four managing partners, serving alongside Sigrid McCawley, Matthew Schwartz, and Alan Vickery, and will continue to serve on its executive committee. ""We have a transparent, effective team of managing partners,"" Harrison said in the interview with Reuters on Wednesday. ""I expect the other managing partners will become more involved in other aspects of the business I've been leading on. I think from a firm perspective, things will be quite seamless."" The firm was founded in 1997, the same year Boies was hired by the U.S. government in antitrust litigation against Microsoft Corp, boosting the firm's reputation as a litigation powerhouse. He later represented Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court battle over the 2000 presidential election recount. The firm had for years been among the most profitable U.S. law firms, with partners commonly earning seven-figure compensation, according to data from The American Lawyer. But, it has lost dozens of partners since the start of 2020. Departing lawyers cited concerns over transparency, culture and the health of the firm, among other factors, as their reasons for leaving. Harrison has said in previous interviews that some of the departures were planned and part of a restructuring and leadership change. Last year, the firm's revenue dropped 38% to $250 million while profits per equity partner dropped by 32% to nearly $2.3 million, according The American Lawyer. Looking ahead, Boies said he is expecting better financial results for this year. ""Our revenue was down significantly last year in part because of the pandemic and in part because the number of lawyers that we had reduced,"" Boies said. ""But I think this year we will be well over the million dollars of revenue per lawyer benchmark.""

Pfizer's Hospira escapes adrenaline patent claims based on PTO omissions,3614,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Pfizer unit's win against Belcher Pharmaceuticals' claims that its adrenaline shot Abboject infringed a Belcher adrenaline patent was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Wednesday. Belcher's patent was invalid because the company purposely omitted important information from its application that would have kept the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from awarding the patent if it had had the information, U.S. Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. Belcher's chief science officer Darren Rubin represented to the PTO that its formulation was a novel invention that was contrary to prior art and solved problems that ""seemed impossible,"" while also telling the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about earlier formulations with similar specifications, Reyna said. Belcher and its attorney Peter Lancaster of Dorsey & Whitney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Pfizer subsidiary Hospira's attorney Matthew Freimuth of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Largo, Florida-based Belcher applied for FDA approval of an injectible formulation of adrenaline in 2012, and applied for a patent related to the drug in 2014, which was issued in 2016. The drug has several potential uses, including countering allergic reactions, treating cardiac arrest, and providing relief for asthma and COPD. Belcher sued Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira in 2017, alleging its application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Abboject infringed Belcher's patent. After a two-day bench trial, U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Delaware ruled last year that the patent was invalid based on inequitable conduct, finding Rubin withheld three pieces of information that would have prevented the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from awarding the patent. Belcher argued on appeal that, among other things, the prior art was immaterial, and that Rubin withheld it because he genuinely believed it was irrelevant based on other features of the prior art that differed from Belcher's drug. Reyna, joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Richard Taranto and Kara Stoll, wrote on Wednesday that the information Rubin withheld was material to the decision to issue the patent and that he intended to mislead the PTO. The prior art disclosed epinephrine formulations with the same pH range as Belcher's drug that would have made the patent obvious, Reyna said. He also noted that the Delaware court found the relevant parts of the patent invalid based on one of the pieces of prior art, an earlier epinephrine product from another company. Reyna also said that the ""single most reasonable inference"" was that Rubin intended to deceive the PTO.

2nd Circ. denies challenges to ban on deadly paint remover,3961,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday denied an industry bid to partly invalidate an Environmental Protection Agency rule banning the deadly methylene chloride chemical in paint removers for consumers, and rejected a separate environmentalists' petition seeking to expand the prohibition. A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Inc's (HSIA) claims that the rule restricts, arbitrarily, not only sales to individuals but also some commercial sales by barring small businesses from distributing the product. The panel also turned down a consolidated petition by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and its co-plaintiffs, who sought to broaden the ban to commercial users, who can still buy the product in bulk, by alleging the EPA was violating its regulatory obligations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). HSIA and its lawyers at Squire Patton Boggs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Robert Sussman, a lawyer for co-plaintiff Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, said: ""It's deeply disappointing that the Court declined to require EPA to ban commercial paint remover uses of methylene chloride after the Agency has delayed action for years despite dozens of deaths."" EPA spokesperson Ken Labbe said: ""Because this is pending litigation, EPA has no additional information to share."" The EPA prohibited the manufacturing, import, processing and distribution of methylene chloride in paint strippers for consumer use in 2019, but not for use in industrial settings. Exposure to methylene chloride fumes can rapidly cause dizziness, loss of consciousness and death, the agency has said. HSIA sued shortly after the 2019 ban, as did the green coalition. HSIA asked the court to vacate provisions of the rule prohibiting retailers from selling the product, arguing it was ""inconsistent"" to allow its commercial use while prohibiting contractors and artisans also commercial users, from buying the product from retailers. The NRDC and its co-plaintiffs for their part claimed that the EPA had violated TSCA obligations to eliminate a chemical with unreasonable risks. Responding to HSIA's claims, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval wrote that the 2019 rule had deferred regulating access to methylene chloride, rather than crafted a policy favoring continued access. The EPA determined, the following year, that commercial use of the chemical presents an unreasonable risk to health, the ruling said. That determination evidenced the absence of a policy favoring continued access to the product with which the retail ban would be ""inconsistent,"" Leval wrote. And given that the 2020 determination had triggered a deadline under the TSCA to finalize a rule on the substance's commercial use within two years, the judge held that the green groups' claims were ""prudentially unripe."" Leval was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Jose Cabranes and Reena Raggi. The case is Labor Council for Latin American Advancement v.

Canada's ruling Liberals pledge massive new investments as election looms,3201,"OTTAWA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party on Wednesday pledged a whopping C$78 billion ($62 billion) in new investments over five years, with a focus on healthcare, if it wins the Sept. 20 federal election. The investments would be partially offset by more than C$25 billion in new revenue, mostly from a higher tax on profits of banks and insurers and fighting tax evasion, the party said in releasing its full election platform. These investments are in addition to the C$101 billion in extra spending over three years passed in a budget earlier this year, and would be spread over five years, from 2021-22 to 2025-26. The Liberals spent heavily on programs to shield citizens and businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the national debt and budget deficits to record highs. Trudeau sidestepped repeated questions as to when the budget might be balanced. ""I think it matters to be fiscally responsible. I think it matters to live within our means,"" he told a news conference in Toronto. ""I think it also matters to be making the right investments so that future generations can prosper."" ""This is a plan for jobs and growth,"" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said standing alongside Trudeau. Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is projected to decline 2 percentage points to 46.5% in 2025-26, the Liberals said. Trudeau called a snap vote two years early on Aug 15 hoping his management of the pandemic and his vaccine roll out would be a springboard to a majority. (See party platform FACTBOX: ) But the polls show Trudeau's Liberals in a statistical tie with Erin O'Toole's Conservatives less than three weeks before the vote. (POLLS: ) The platform is ""more borrowing, more debt, higher taxes, and rising prices,"" said Dan Robertson, chief of strategy for O'Toole, on Twitter. O'Toole has also put forward a big-spending platform, but he said on Tuesday he would balance the budget in 10 years time ""without cuts"" and only by boosting revenues through stronger economic growth. The Conservatives have yet to detail the costs of their platform. ""If he doesn't show the numbers, why should Canadians believe him?"" Trudeau said of O'Toole's pledge to balance the budget. ""He's relying on a level of magical thinking that involves 3% growth every single year."" Most of the individual policies in the Liberal platform have been announced, but this is the first glimpse at a full pricing of the plan with investments focused on improving long-term care, mental health, indigenous health and lowering soaring housing costs. One new element in the platform is a promise by Liberals to increase accessibility for abortions across the country while revoking the charity status of anti-abortion organizations, an issue that has historically divided Canadian Conservatives. While legal in Canada, access to abortions varies by province. Trudeau has suggested that a woman's right to choose could be threatened if the Conservatives win, given that some social conservatives want abortion limits to be imposed. O'Toole reiterated on Wednesday that he is pro-choice. ($1 = 1.2587 Canadian dollars) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge will approve Purdue Pharma bankruptcy plan that shields Sacklers,5202,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Wednesday he would approve OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan, clearing a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shielding the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future opioid litigation. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said that with small changes he would approve the plan, which overcame opposition to garner support from nearly all states, local governments, tribes, hospitals and other creditors that voted on the restructuring. They became creditors in the bankruptcy by virtue of suing Purdue and Sackler family members over their alleged contributions to the nationwide opioid epidemic. Drain said it was clear the wrongful marketing of the company's opioid products contributed to the addiction crisis, which touched every corner of the country. ""That makes the bankruptcy case before me highly unusual and complex,"" said Drain, who spent more than six hours reading his ruling from the bench. The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, dissolves the drugmaker and shifts assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company will be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic. It also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks introduced legislation to block such legal releases. The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid addiction crisis. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. The Purdue bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members. The contribution is in the form of cash that will be paid over roughly a decade and also includes $175 million in value from relinquishing control of charitable institutions. Drain noted that he had expected a larger contribution from the Sacklers and said the evidence showed more might have been secured through litigation, although that was hard to predict. ""This is a bitter result,"" he said. He also said he would not jeopardize what the plan achieved by rejecting it and asked for small changes to secure his final approval. Still, the evidence showed the plan was negotiated by the creditors who all viewed the Sacklers as ""the other side, the opposition, the potential defendants,"" Drain said. ""This is not the Sacklers' plan."" 'INSULTING TO VICTIMS' The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct. Several state attorneys general opposed the plan. “This order is insulting to victims of the opioid epidemic who had no voice in these proceedings,” said Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who said his office would appeal. A lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog and part of the Department of Justice, said his office would file a motion for a stay of the order confirming the plan during the appeal. More than 95% of creditors voting approved Purdue's restructuring, far above the legal threshold required for a bankruptcy judge's blessing. Ryan Hampton resigned on Tuesday as the co-chair of the official creditors committee, which included governments and other creditors. Even though the committee helped negotiate the plan, he called the outcome a ""total injustice."" He said people like himself who were recovering from addiction were the real victims and they had to fight states and local governments during plan negotiations for the $750 million set aside for them. ""At no point were the victims listened to,"" he said. Sackler family members behind Purdue were prolific philanthropists, with their names on museum wings and other cultural institutions. They have also agreed to a prohibition on associating their name with charitable contributions until litigation settlement funds are fully paid, according to court records. Much of the plan's value is contingent on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications that Purdue has under development. Drain noted that Sackler family owners who testified showed little remorse. ""A forced apology is not really an apology,"" he said. ""And so we will live without one."" Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits against the company and Sackler family for contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999. Drain, the judge overseeing the case in a White Plains, New York, bankruptcy court, agreed early in the case to halt litigation against Purdue and Sackler family members, who had not filed for bankruptcy themselves. Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They previously agreed to pay $225 million to resolve separate civil allegations with the Justice Department. The family members have denied those allegations. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge throws out suit against Tesaro board over $5.1 bln sale,3058,"(Reuters) - A Delaware judge threw out a shareholder’s suit accusing Tesaro Inc’s managers and lead venture capital investor of selling the cancer drug company to GlaxoSmithKline Plc in an allegedly conflicted $5.1 billion sale. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn in Wilmington said on Tuesday that she was dismissing former Tesaro investor John Kihm’s suit because she was “satisfied,” that when Tesaro’s shareholders approved the deal, they were fully informed and not coerced by major investor and venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates Inc. “In the complaint, the private equity sponsor is everywhere and nowhere: the plaintiff offers pages of allegations about the sponsor’s motivations, but does not assert the sponsor was a controlling stockholder, nor that the sponsor or any of its agents had any specific role in the flawed sale process,” Zurn wrote in granting the defendants' motions to dismiss. Kihm’s attorneys, including Randall Baron of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Neither did attorneys for the Tesaro officers and directors, NEA and Citigroup. Representatives for GlaxoSmithKline, NEA and Citigroup also did not respond to requests for comment. GlaxoSmithKline announced in December 2018 that it had agreed to purchase Waltham, Massachusetts-based Tesaro for $75 a share at a premium. The deal closed in January 2019. Kihm filed a proposed class action in November 2020, alleging that NEA and its employees who sat on Tesaro’s board pushed for the acquisition to financially benefit the venture capital firm. The Tesaro investor also accused CitiGroup of being conflicted because it was acting as Tesaro’s financial advisor while advising GlaxoSmithKline on another transaction. The defendants denied wrongdoing and moved to dismiss the lawsuit. In her ruling, Zurn said the Tesaro investor didn’t show that documents recommending the transaction to shareholders lacked important information. The judge said that certain projections didn’t need to be included because they wouldn’t have changed the overall information available to shareholders. She also said the documents adequately informed Tesaro's investors about Citigroup’s conflicts of interest as well as conflicts of interest between one of Tesaro’s directors and NEA. The case is Kihm v. Mott, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 2020-0938.

Texas's near-total abortion ban takes effect after Supreme Court inaction,5913,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Texas on Wednesday enacted the strictest anti-abortion law in the country after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to act on a request by abortion-rights groups to block the law banning the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy. It was a victory for conservatives, who have long sought to eliminate abortion access in the United States. Prominent Democrats including President Joe Biden voiced outrage, saying the Texas law violated the right to abortion access established by the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973. ""My administration ... will protect and defend that right,"" Biden said. Abortion rights activists said such a ban has not been enacted in any U.S. state since that landmark ruling. Texas abortion providers worked until almost the midnight deadline, when the 6-3 conservative-majority court's inaction allowed the law to be enforced while abortion-rights groups further pursue their legal challenge to its constitutionality. The justices could yet take action on the Texas case. But they have already agreed to hear arguments in Mississippi's effort to overturn Roe v. Wade. The law amounts to a near-total ban on abortion procedures given that 85% to 90% of abortions occur after six weeks of pregnancy, and would likely force many clinics to close, the abortion-rights groups said. A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. But it remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and a majority of Republicans opposing them. Texas's Republican-controlled state legislature this week also passed a bill restricting voter access, following Republican former President Donald Trump's election defeat, which he falsely blamed on widespread voter fraud. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to sign that bill into law. 'BOUNTY SYSTEM' Abortion opponents nationwide are hopeful the Supreme Court, which now has three Trump-appointed justices, will eventually take steps to reverse Roe v. Wade. At Whole Woman's Health in Fort Worth, Texas, clinic staff worked up to midnight, serving 25 patients in the 2-1/2 hours before the deadline. The national group said its Texas locations, also including Austin and McKinney, remained open on Wednesday. ""This morning I woke up feeling a deep sadness,"" said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization's chief executive. ""This law opens up a bounty system, a vigilante kind of system that can call into question anyone who supports access to abortion."" A demonstrator holds up an abortion flag outside of the U.S. Supreme Court as justices hear a major abortion case on the legality of a Republican-backed Louisiana law that imposes restrictions on abortion doctors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 4, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo Whole Woman's Health, Planned Parenthood and other women's health providers, doctors and some clergy members challenged the law in federal court in Austin in July, contending it violated the constitutional right to an abortion. The law, signed on May 19, is unusual in that it prevents government officials from enforcing the ban, instead giving private citizens that power by enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. Citizens who win such lawsuits would be entitled to at least $10,000. Abortion providers say the law could lead to hundreds of costly lawsuits that would be logistically difficult to defend. In a legal filing, Texas officials told the Supreme Court justices to reject the abortion providers' request, doubting it can be challenged before it has been enforced against them. Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states that have enacted ""heartbeat"" abortion bans, which outlaw the procedure once the rhythmic contracting of fetal cardiac tissue can be detected, often at six weeks - sometimes before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Courts have blocked such bans. ""Texas Right to Life is thankful that the Texas Heartbeat Act is now in effect. We are now the first state ever to enforce a heartbeat law. We still await word from SCOTUS,"" spokeswoman Kimberlyn Schwartz said in a statement, using an acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States. A court could still put the ban on hold, and no court has yet ruled on its constitutionality, Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, wrote in a tweet. ""Despite what some will say, this isn't the 'end' of Roe,"" he wrote. 'BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER STATES' In the Texas case, empowering private citizens helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the government. It is a formula other states seeking heartbeat bans could potentially follow, legal experts said. ""Texas has certainly created a blueprint for other states,"" said Mary Ziegler, an expert on abortion at Florida State University College of Law. Those states may see that path as unnecessary, she said, given that the Supreme Court has already agreed to hear a major case over Mississippi's 2018 law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The justices will hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. The Texas challenge seeks to prevent judges, county clerks and other state entities from enforcing the law. A federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss the case, prompting an immediate appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which halted further proceedings. On Sunday, the 5th Circuit denied a request by the abortion providers to block the law pending the appeal. The providers then asked the Supreme Court for an emergency ruling.

EU health body says no urgent need for vaccine boosters,1383,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said on Wednesday there was no urgent need for booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the fully vaccinated, citing data on the effectiveness of shots.

Antibody levels higher after Moderna shot; Lilly arthritis drug used with steroid cuts death risk,3729,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Antibody levels are higher after Moderna vaccine The mRNA vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) induces higher levels of antibodies against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 than the similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech SE , Belgian researchers have found, although what this means for their efficacy is not clear. Soon after receiving their second shot, the 688 healthcare workers who got Moderna's vaccine had antibody levels roughly twice as high as the 959 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech product, regardless of their ages, doctors at a Belgian medical center reported. This held true even after accounting for individual risk factors, and regardless of whether participants had previously been infected with the virus, the researchers reported on Monday in JAMA. Antibodies are just one component of the immune system's defenses, however. The study cannot determine whether one vaccine is more effective at preventing infection or illness, or whether the antibodies induced stay longer in the blood before disappearing. Those questions, and others, require further investigation, the researchers said. Arthritis drug adds to benefit of steroids in severe illness Hospitalized COVID-19 patients died less often if they received Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib along with the other treatments their doctors had prescribed, according to a study published on Wednesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The randomized trial involved 1,525 seriously ill patients, all of whom needed extra oxygen to help with breathing. More than 90% were already receiving dexamethasone, a cheap generic steroid known to improve survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients. While baricitinib, sold under the brand name Olumiant, did not appear to keep patients from getting sicker, it did reduce their risk of dying. The 28-day and 60-day death rates were 5% lower among patients randomly assigned to receive baricitinib instead of a placebo. Baricitinib is already approved in the United States for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead Science's (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir. The two drugs together appear to have more benefit than remdesivir alone. In the new study, more than 80% of participants were not receiving remdesivir, suggesting that baricitinib also ""has synergistic effects with other standard-of-care treatments,"" including dexamethasone, researchers said. Vaccine poses low risk for adults with high-risk allergies Highly allergic adults can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, a new study suggests. Among the 8,102 patients with allergies in the Israeli study, 95% received the shots in routine settings because their risk of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine was low, and no such reactions were reported. The remaining 429 patients, who were considered to be highly allergic, received the vaccines under careful supervision and were observed for two hours afterward. Nine had allergic reactions, including three who showed signs of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. All responded to treatment with epinephrine and no one had to be hospitalized, according to a report published on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open. An editorial published with the study said lessons from this study of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine are likely ""generalizable to the Moderna"" shot as well.

Aviation insurers hold back on Afghanistan flights after U.S. troops leave,3239,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Aviation insurers are unwilling to insure commercial flights into Afghanistan because of the risk of attacks after U.S. troops left the country, making it hard to deliver aid or evacuate people, industry sources told Reuters. Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers took control of the airport in Kabul on Tuesday after a massive airlift of more than 123,000 people by the United States and its allies ended. read more Bruce Carman, chief underwriting officer at Hive Aero, said his firm had been able to offer insurance cover for evacuation flights last week, but ""no one can fly there right now"". Shortly before the final pullout of U.S. forces on Monday, an executive with an airline involved in the evacuation flights said it was already hard to find insurers willing to quote for Afghanistan. Lack of air traffic control services, rocket attacks and reports of hostilities around the airport make insuring flights to the Afghan capital exceptionally risky, sources said. Afghanistan's airspace was ""released to the military"" in mid-August and the aviation authority advised airlines to avoid its air corridors. U.S. civil aircraft are barred from operating over the country unless given prior authorization, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday. read more Premium rates to cover aircraft flying into Afghanistan against attacks - known as hull war insurance - rose fivefold last week, with insurers putting in strict requirements, such as two-hour turnarounds at Kabul airport, a broker said. Airlines typically buy hull war cover if they are flying into conflict areas, but the chaotic mass evacuation and withdrawal of foreign troops meant the risks for Afghanistan were particularly acute. ""There was a massive unknown as to how the Taliban would react to the evacuation, and couple this with the added threat of ISIS-K specifically targeting the airport, the stakes were very high,"" said Hive's Carman. ""Premiums charged were a reflection of the level of danger."" Islamic State affiliate ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside the airport on Thursday that killed 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians. The World Health Organization's regional emergency director Rick Brennan said last week that insurance premiums had ""skyrocketed at prices we have never seen before"". read more But a plane carrying WHO medicines and health supplies did land in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Monday, in the final hours of the U.S. withdrawal - the first shipment to get in since the Taliban took control on Aug. 15. read more The flight had insurance, a WHO spokesperson said, adding: ""Our air cargo partners continue to negotiate for the best rates with insurers, which are fluctuating."" Insurers may restart cover quite quickly if air traffic control services resume, sources said. The Taliban are in talks with Qatar and Turkey about the future management of Kabul airport.

Migrant arrivals to Spain's Canary Islands double from last year,1540,"GRAN CANARIA, Spain, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spain's sea rescue service on Wednesday rescued around 100 migrants trying to reach the Canary Islands in rickety boats from north or west Africa amid a surge in arrivals that have more than doubled so far this year from 2020 levels. The migrants were rescued off three boats and all appeared to be in good health, a sea rescue service spokesperson said. On Tuesday the service rescued 31 migrants on a boat off the island of Lanzarote, with one of them dying shortly after. The migrants told emergency services the boat had left African shores with around 60 people on board and that some had fallen into the sea during the journey, the spokesperson said. A total of 8,222 migrants arrived in the Canaries illegally between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15, compared to 3,364 in the same period of last year, according to Interior Ministry data. Over 23,000 migrants arrived in the archipelago in 2020, which marked an eight-fold increase from 2019 and was one of the busiest years for such crossings in the past decade, overwhelming authorities and sparking tensions on the islands. Overall arrivals in Spain grew by 29% in 2020, reaching close to 42,000 people. Earlier this year, authorities opened several camps for migrants in the Canaries. They were devised as a more stable solution after the 2020 influx, when hundreds of people stayed for weeks at a crammed, hastily improvised dockside camp, where conditions were harshly criticised by rights groups.

Meet the St. Louis bankruptcy chief who aims for pragmatism,6821,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - After a decade on the bench, St. Louis's Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kathy Surratt-States was caught between a coal company that was trying to reduce pension benefits and retired miners who were aghast at the proposal. All eyes were on her as she tried to balance the reality of a company burdened with unsustainable debt and its obligations to its miners. In the end, she approved the company's plan, a difficult decision that she stands by. But it wasn’t easy. In deciding what to do about pension benefits in St. Louis-based Patriot Coal's first Chapter 11 case (it filed a second time a couple of years later, selling its assets to another coal producer) she read more than 900 letters from miners and their families, which often detailed the personal and financial hardships they endured. In a recent interview with Reuters, Surratt-States said she would note at every hearing how many letters she had received: “I thought it was important that those people had written to me, that I read those letters and that we acknowledged their part and opinions in the case.” Patriot Coal was one of the most high-profile cases Surratt-States, 54, had presided over since joining the bench in 2003. She made headlines in 2013 with her approval of the pension cuts, which had prompted staunch opposition from the United Mine Workers of America. Pension cuts for miners had become a hot topic as other large coal producers trickled into bankruptcy. AN EARLY START Unlike many lawyers and judges who turn to bankruptcy later in their careers, Surratt-States got her first taste of the practice area early, taking a job in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri after her first year of law school. She took on what she calls the “rather unglamorous job” of reorganizing the law clerks’ library. Despite the somewhat unexciting nature of the role, she enjoyed the work. Bankruptcy judges would sometimes tell her about interesting cases they were overseeing, which led her to slip into the back of their courtrooms and witness the action first hand. Surratt-States would eventually become the first Black bankruptcy judge in the judicial districts that comprise the 8th U.S. Circuit. She said she was excited to introduce some diversity to an area where ""there weren't a lot of women and certainly not a lot of people of color."" At the time, she was only the eighth Black bankruptcy judge in the country, out of a total of about 350. There are now 17. While she believes the bankruptcy bar is headed in the right direction in terms of diversifying its makeup, there’s still a ways to go, she says. That will likely need to start with building up a pipeline that begins with summer associates at law firms, she added. FAMILY MATTERS Surratt-States grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is a graduate of Booker T. Washington High School. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father an aircraft mechanic at American Airlines (which itself filed for bankruptcy in 2011.) Her parents stressed the importance of education, and she ultimately became the first lawyer in her family. She graduated from Oklahoma City University in 1988 with a degree in political science and earned her law degree from Washington University School of Law in 1991. Surratt-States, who is married to a St. Louis police department lieutenant, spent two years clerking at the St. Louis bankruptcy court after she graduated from law school. She later practiced bankruptcy and commercial litigation at Campbell & Coyne, followed by Ziercher and Hocker. Following her 2003 appointment to the bench, she became the chief judge in 2012. Her daughter is now a sophomore in college studying film production. Surratt-States is proud of the fact that when a group of her daughter’s classmates recently watched Ferris Bueller’s Day Off – one of the judge’s favorite movies – her daughter was one of the few who had seen the film. (The Blues Brothers is the judge’s other favorite.) “She told the rest of them, ‘Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. It's a great movie,'” Surratt-States said. MAKING THE HARD CALLS Since most of the cases on the St. Louis docket are consumer bankruptcies, Surratt-States spends a lot of her time confronting family troubles. The judge says as challenging as Patriot Coal was, the individual debtors often present the toughest situations for her. Consumer cases are especially hard if they involve domestic support obligations or children, she said. “Those are always difficult – to look at what happened with people who may have been in family court versus what's going on their lives now that one of the parties is in bankruptcy,” she said. Sometimes that means dealing with a debtor that's trying to hold on to a house or keep a family afloat when money has become tight, thanks to the pandemic, she said. The good news, she said, is that she's noticed Chapter 13 trustees have been more lenient with individual debtors during the COVID-19 crisis, giving them more time to sort out their finances or get their hands on necessary tax documents. On the corporate side of the docket, the Patriot Coal decision posed a different kind of challenge. Approving the company’s request to modify its benefits for thousands of retirees and their families meant ceasing pension contributions and replacing existing health benefits with a voluntary employees’ beneficiary association. The issue was especially sensitive as the company’s executives had recently been approved for bonuses. The United Mine Workers of America threatened to strike. Surratt-States issued her decision after a five-day trial. In the ruling, she posited that the situation may have been the result of ""unwarranted optimism"" by executives, but that for unions, there is ""likely some responsibility to be absorbed for demanding benefits that the employer cannot realistically fund in perpetuity."" The bottom line, she said, was the practicality of the situation. Patriot Coal, which was dealing with a $3 billion debt load at the time, simply could not afford to continue paying for health insurance at the level agreed to under the collective bargaining agreement. “Coal prices went down and expenses went up,” Surratt-States said. “So as a practical matter, are they going to have no insurance or some insurance going forward? That’s basically what it was going to come down to.” Read more: Bankrupt Patriot Coal can reject collective bargaining -court Maria Chutchian reports on corporate bankruptcies and restructurings.

11th Circuit sides with insurer in COVID coverage case,2156,"(Reuters) - In a second win for the insurer at the federal appellate level, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that Cincinnati Insurance Co’s business income interruption coverage did not include a Georgia dental practice’s losses from a state shelter-in-place order and federal guidance to postpone routine and elective medical procedures at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 11th Circuit agreed with Cincinnati’s attorneys at Litchfield Cavo and a March ruling by a federal judge in Atlanta, who dismissed Gilreath Dental Associates’ potential class action for failure to allege any property damage that would trigger coverage under the “all-risk” policy’s business income interruption, extra expense, or civil authority clauses. Gilreath was represented by Hall & Lampros. Circuit Judges Charles Wilson, Robin Rosenbaum, and Britt Grant issued the unpublished, per curiam opinion Tuesday without hearing argument. “Gilreath has alleged nothing that could qualify, to a layman or anyone else, as physical loss or damage” because the orders and guidance “did not damage or change the property in a way that required its repair or precluded its future use for dental procedures,” the opinion says. The 8th Circuit also ruled for Cincinnati Insurance in July in the first federal circuit court decision on BII coverage for losses arising from pandemic-related shutdown orders. In both circuits, Cincinnati drew amicus support from the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. According to the Covid Coverage Litigation Tracker at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, 183 federal appeals are pending, with 61 in the 9th Circuit alone. At least 57 cases are pending in state appellate courts, according to the tracker. The case is Gilreath Family & Cosmetic Dentistry dba Gilreath Dental Associates, OBO itself and others similarly situated, v. Cincinnati Insurance Co., 11th U.S. Circuit No. 21-11046.

"Pfizer, Merck launch new trials of oral COVID-19 drugs",2569,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) announced on Wednesday new trials of their experimental oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19 as the race to develop an easy-to-administer treatment for the potentially fatal illness heats up. Pfizer said its latest mid-to-late-stage trial will enroll 1,140 non-hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus infection who are not at risk of severe illness. Patients in the trial will be given Pfizer's pill, known as PF-07321332, and a low dose of ritonavir, an older medication widely used in combination treatments for HIV infection. Pfizer's drug is designed to block the activity of a key enzyme that is needed for the coronavirus to multiply. Merck said its new trial will study experimental drug molnupiravir for the prevention of COVID-19 among adults in the same household as someone diagnosed with symptomatic coronavirus infection. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are already conducting a late-stage trial of the treatment in non-hospitalized patients to see if it reduces the risk of hospitalization or death. Molnupiravir is a type of antiviral designed to introduce errors into the RNA of the virus that eventually prevent it from replicating. Pfizer began in July a different trial of PF-07321332 in adults with COVID-19 infection who are at high risk of becoming severely ill due to underlying health conditions such as diabetes. The company said it expects initial results from that study some time this fall. Rivals Pfizer and Merck, along with Swiss pharmaceutical Roche Holding AG (ROG.S), have made the most progress in developing what would be the first antiviral pill to treat, or possibly prevent, COVID-19. To date, Gilead Sciences Inc's (GILD.O) intravenous drug Veklury, known generically as remdesivir, is the only approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 in the United States. Roche and partner Atea Pharmaceuticals (AVIR.O) in June said early data from a trial of their experimental oral antiviral AT-527 showed that it lowered viral load in hospitalized patients. Merck said in June that the U.S. government agreed to pay about $1.2 billion for 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir, if it is proven to work and authorized by regulators. The company said it expected to file for U.S. emergency use authorization of molnupiravir in the second half of 2021 at the earliest. Pfizer said in July if the PF-07321332 trial was successful, it would file for a potential emergency use authorization in the fourth quarter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Spain reaches goal of fully vaccinating 70% of its population,1515,"MADRID, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spain said on Wednesday 70% of its population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, fulfilling a goal set by the government for August, while the incidence rate kept the decreasing tendency of the past month after a big surge. With over 66 million doses administered, 70.3% of the Spanish population had received by Aug. 31 a complete vaccination programme while 77% had been partially vaccinated, Health Ministry data showed. ""We have achieved it thanks to the strength of the national public service, the effort by health professionals, the work from public agencies and the great awareness from citizens,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted. The average number of cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days in Spain decreased to 221 on Wednesday from 233 the prior day, according to the Health Ministry, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to over 4.8 million. But deaths registered in the past seven days grew, totalling 352 on Wednesday's report versus 319 on Tuesday, taking the overall number of fatalities caused by the virus to around 84,500. Health Minister Carolina Darias urged citizens to remain cautious to achieve a lower incidence. But in a sign of progress, central and regional authorities agreed to increase from 40% to a maximum of 60% the allowed occupancy in outdoor sports facilities, such as soccer stadiums, for the month of September, in a relief to clubs hard-hit by the pandemic's impact.

Most vaccinated Americans want COVID-19 booster shots -Reuters/Ipsos poll,3341,"WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As the United States gears up for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign, most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found, largely driven by concern over the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. The U.S. government said if health regulators approve the move, it will roll out COVID-19 booster shots starting Sept. 20 out of concern about waning vaccine protection against COVID-19 infections. Many scientists say the need for a booster has not been proven. The government has already made third shots available to immunocompromised adults. The national survey, conducted Aug. 27-30, found that among those adults who received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, 76% want a booster, while 6% do not and 18% were not sure. Among those aged 55 and over, 80% said they want one. ""I've got a four-year-old grandson. I want to make sure he knows me,"" said retired journalist Dora Ann Reaves, 75, from South Carolina. ""I'm going to take every opportunity to take every shot I can. I've already had everything else I can have, other than taking shots for bubonic plague."" The results reflect anxiety over the Delta variant that has caused a surge in infections and hospitalizations, and show the public favors boosters more than scientists do, said Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University. ""There's a lot of hedging among people in the medical community about the necessity of boosters, so it sounds like the general public is more in favor than a lot of practitioners are,"" he said. There is no harm in some people not wanting a booster because not everyone needs one, Gallagher said, adding that at-risk individuals should get them. The U.S. began offering the additional shot last month to people with compromised immune systems. Among those who want boosters, almost 43% said they were worried about the Delta variant and over 34% cited their age. Concern that their initial inoculation was no longer effective was cited by 28% of respondents, while 15% said they were immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk. ""I would like to get the booster to be on the safe side,"" said Texan customer service representative Joe Guerra, 63, who has rheumatoid arthritis, which could put him at higher risk. Many widely used medicines for the condition suppress the immune system. Guerra also expressed concern that millions of Americans remain unvaccinated. As of Aug. 31, over 66 million people - 25% of U.S. adults - have not received a single vaccine dose, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. ""It's not a smart thing to not get it. Just play by the rules, keep yourself safe, keep those around you safe,"" said high school graduate Jamarii Perrington, 18, in Massachusetts. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,427 adults, including 3,042 who had received at least once dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 2,374 who expressed interest in a booster shot. Ipsos weighted the results using the latest population and vaccination statistics so that they better reflected the U.S. population. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Moderna to recall COVID-19 doses in Japan after stainless steel contaminants found,3289,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T) on Wednesday said they are working with Japanese authorities to recall three batches of COVID-19 vaccine after an investigation found stainless steel contaminants in some vials. Japanese authorities had suspended use of these batches of Moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses last week after being notified of the contamination issue. Japan's health ministry said on Wednesday, based on information from the companies' investigation, that it did not believe the particles of stainless steel pose any additional health risk. Moderna said the stainless steel contamination probably occurred during production. read more Takeda distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan. The most probable cause of contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Moderna said in the joint statement with Takeda. The material was confirmed to be stainless steel. Moderna conducted its investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi (ROVI.MC), which operates the plant where the contamination occurred. ""Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk,"" Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement. Moderna shares were up 2.6% following the statement. Shares of Rovi were up than 4.5% after falling more than 10% on news of the dose suspensions. Takeda shares rose more than 2%. Administration of the Moderna shots from the three lots was suspended in Japan after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but shots from two other lots from the same Rovi manufacturing line were suspended as a precaution. Those three lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue, the statement said. Rovi has fully inspected its manufacturing facility and implemented new procedures to avoid similar problems in the future, it added. Use of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances were found in unused vials, while others appear to have been the result of incorrectly inserted needles causing bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off. read more The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots. read more The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated. Moderna and Takeda said in the joint statement that there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine. ""The relationship is currently considered to be coincidental,"" the companies said in the statement. About 500,000 people have received shots from the three suspended Moderna batches, Taro Kono, Japan's minister in charge of the vaccination campaign, told reporters on Friday. Moderna said it cannot confirm how many doses were distributed from the batches. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge denies class cert in 'sprawling' NFL opioid litigation,4165,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco has declined to certify a nationwide class in a lawsuit accusing the National Football League of failing to regulate teams' use of painkillers, saying a trial involving conduct that affected thousands of players over a 35-year period ""would become a sprawling train wreck."" U.S. District Judge William Alsup on Tuesday said variations in how the NFL's 32 teams administered opioids and other drugs, changes in practices over time, and the league's inconsistent recordkeeping all presented obstacles to a class-wide resolution of the 2014 lawsuit. The eight retired players who brought the case, including Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent, had proposed a class of all NFL players between 1973 and 2008 who received opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, local anesthetics or other medications. Alsup on Tuesday also said negligence, product liability and medical monitoring laws can vary between the 23 states implicated in the case. ""The Court is concerned that trial of plaintiffs’ proposed nationwide negligence class implicating the law of at least 23 different states would become a sprawling train wreck,"" the judge wrote. An NFL spokesman and the league's lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did the players' lawyers at Silverman Thompson Slutkin & White. Dent and the other plaintiffs sued the NFL in 2014, claiming the league spearheaded a ""return to play"" policy in which injured players were given painkillers and sent back into games, leading to further injuries. The players accused the league of negligence, negligent hiring and retention, fraud, and other claims on behalf of the proposed nationwide class. Alsup dismissed the case in 2015, finding that the players' union's bargaining agreement with the NFL precluded them from bringing the claims to court. The 9th Circuit in 2018 reversed, saying the NFL was not a party to those agreements. On remand, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint abandoning all but their negligence claims. Alsup in 2019 said the league could not be held liable because it was not directly involved in distributing or administering medications. But the 9th Circuit again disagreed with the judge, ruling last year that the players could succeed on their alternate theory that the NFL voluntarily took on the duty of overseeing the administration of drugs by regulating their use by teams. Alsup in February denied the NFL's motion to dismiss the ""voluntary undertaking"" claim, and the players then moved for class certification. But Alsup on Tuesday found there were too many variations between teams, states, and the NFL's supervision of each team over time to support a nationwide class. In the 2005 regular season, for example, the New York Jets dispensed nearly 470 doses of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Toradol, while the Indianapolis Colts a year earlier administered nearly 900, Alsup found. And the Jets administered more than twice as many Vicodin tablets in 2007 as in the previous year. ""Plaintiffs have provided no reason or evidence, other than exaggerated rhetoric, to believe that the least volume of medications was equally unreasonable to the most and that such differences are immaterial,"" Alsup wrote.

Britain to give third COVID-19 vaccine doses to immunosuppressed,2297,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Britain will give severely immunosuppressed people a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine to increase their chances of generating a better immune response, although officials stressed the offer was separate from any broader booster vaccine programme. With the move, Britain follows the United States, which last month authorised a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)-BioNTech and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from two-dose regimens. read more Public Health England on Wednesday said the decision to offer third doses to the immunosuppressed followed data that showed 40% of immunosuppressed people generated only low levels of antibodies from two vaccine shots. However, officials stressed the third dose was not a ""booster"" dose as it would be administered as part of the primary vaccination schedule and aimed at helping the initial process of generating an immune response. ""We want people with severely suppressed immune systems to have the best chance of gaining protection from COVID-19 via vaccination,"" said Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 Immunisation for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The JCVI's final advice on the broader booster programme for the elderly and vulnerable is expected soon. The committee previously said it could start this month. read more Third doses will be given to people with immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV/AIDS, and those who have received immunosuppressive treatments like chemotherapy. The move will impact less than 1% of the population, around 400-500,000 people. Officials said mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna should be used as the third dose, as there was more data on these shots, but AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) vaccine could be added later if the data supported the move. The government said it accepted the JCVI's advice. ""The NHS (National Health Service) will contact people as soon as possible to discuss their needs and arrange an appointment for a third dose where clinically appropriate,"" health minister Sajid Javid said. ""This is not the start of the booster programme – we are continuing to plan for this to begin in September."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Majority of U.S. companies may mandate COVID-19 vaccine in coming months - survey,2040,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - More than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment, according to a national survey of nearly 1,000 employers. In the face of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, spurred by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, that has strained the U.S. health care system, many companies have come out with mask mandates and changed their vaccination policies. Google's parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Walmart Inc (WMT.N), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine. read more The survey, which polled 961 U.S. companies that together employ around 9.7 million people, found that by the fourth quarter of 2021, over 52% of employers could have one or more vaccine mandate requirements, an increase from 21% currently. The mandates could range from requiring vaccination for staff to access common areas such as cafeterias to requiring vaccination for all employees, according to the survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson between Aug. 18 and 25. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. ""We expect even more employers to institute vaccine mandates in the wake of FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine,"" Willis Towers Watson's population health leader, Jeff Levin-Scherz, said. The survey found the number of employers that track whether employees have completed their vaccination was increasing, with more companies considering implementing financial incentives for vaccinations. About 62% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, while more than half or roughly 52% are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Tuesday, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

"More vaccines urgently needed in Latin America to contain Delta, says health agency",1791,"BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Three-quarters of the people in Latin America and the Caribbean have not been fully immunized against COVID-19 in contrast to the United States and Canada where a majority have been vaccinated, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. PAHO Director Carissa Etienne stressed the inequality in the access to vaccines in a region that has been disproportionately hit by the pandemic, with nearly a third of the world's deaths. ""We need more vaccine donations,"" she urged in a briefing from Washington, appealing to countries around the world with excess doses to quickly share them with the region to save lives. While vaccines lack in most countries, over half the population of the United States and more than 60% of the people of Canada, Chile and Uruguay have been fully vaccinated. The Americas region needs an additional 540 million doses to ensure that every country can cover at least 60% of its population, she said. ""The best way to protect against variants of concern, like the Delta variant, is to ensure more people are fully vaccinated everywhere,"" Etienne stressed. COVID-19 infections are surging again in North America and hospitalization rates among young people and adults below the age of 50 are higher today than at any other point in the pandemic, PAHO reported. COVID-19 outbreaks are accelerating in multiple Central American countries, especially Costa Rica and Belize, according to PAHO. In the Caribbean, Jamaica is seeing its highest-ever COVID death toll as its hospitals reach full capacity. In South America, infections are declining, except for Venezuela, where cases are plateauing, and Suriname, where transmission has increased for four consecutive weeks.

PMI Q2 2021: Corporate work puts on a dazzling performance,5754,"The record-breaking PMI performance in Q2 may have been driven in a large part by the hot corporate practice area, including M&A activity. But can it last? In the second quarter of 2021, the Thomson Reuters Peer Monitor Index (PMI) hit an all-time high, rocketing up 22 points to a previously untouchable score of 84, its greatest showing of all time. While we have gone to great effort to point out the myriad underlying conditions that had to line up just right to achieve it, this is still a phenomenal result which deserves a deeper look. At first glance the record-setting PMI can be credited to that ever-topical COVID-19 pandemic. For our purposes however, the pandemic served to create an exceptionally low baseline for compassion to current metrics. Unlike the great recession, this crisis has left the general health of the legal economy suppressed rather than damaged. As the suppression was removed the legal industry snapped back into full production. So, there you have it: Litigation’s 7.7% demand growth and Real Estate’s 17.6% growth? All beneficiaries of a low baseline. Once measured against 2019’s 2nd quarter, this massive growth evaporates to -0.9% and 1.6%, respectably. Like a stage magician’s illusion, what you perceive is largely a function of where you’re looking. Except, there is a problem. While at a first glance comparisons to the last “normal” year of 2019 show many practices flat or down, one practice stands out from the rest as deserving of the spotlight: corporate. Although the corporate practice group saw smaller 2021 vs. 2020 growth than real estate, its 2021 vs 2020 growth was still impressive at 12.7%. Importantly, we see that this growth is no illusion in the above figure, with 2021 vs 2019 growth at just over 11%. Quickly, let’s contrast it to litigation’s performance during the same period. In the above chart we can see that, in a Q2 2021 vs Q2 2020 matchup, corporate work is still well ahead of litigation in growth across all market segments. Litigation’s growth certainly appears respectable here as few firms would look askance at growing only 7.7%. Yet when we zoom out to our 2019 comparison, we see litigation is still below its “normal” baseline, having yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level. Corporate on the other hand? Its growth appears unflappable, with Am Law 100 firms seeing 15% demand growth above 2019’s levels. Consider that litigation makes up 29% of the large law firm hours tracked and corporate lords over an additional quarter portion. This quarter’s metrics become more impressive in light of this, as corporate carries flagging practices like litigation across the finish line into Q3. Except, once again, there is a problem. This figure displays how practices with higher demand growth tend to have higher lawyer growth as they require an ever-increasing number of professionals to sate demand. The inverse can also be shown as practices which are shrinking tend to bleed lawyers as prospective recruits look to hotter practice areas and old hands move to where the grass is greener. Mergers & acquisitions and general corporate are the two components of corporate (All) that in a year-to-date June 2021 vs 2020 comparison, were maintaining extremely high growth rates. Yet, they also go against the trend when it comes to recruiting. General corporate work is almost able to maintain the labor it already has despite its high practice growth. M&A has completely broken from the pack, hemorrhaging lawyers, down almost 3% YTD, even as it nears 15% practice demand growth. The most likely interpretation? Corporate work is growing so fast that, in a labor market where new blood is a rare commodity, their lawyers are experiencing intense burnout. M&A especially is undergoing a sort of “too much of a good thing” phase, where it’s growing so fast that the lawyers simply cannot keep up and are dropping out faster than they can be replaced. There are three potential ways this is likely to play out. The first is that corporate law firms turn down work they would have otherwise readily accepted because their operations have reached their breaking point. Secondly, firms feel reluctant to turn down work and the revenue that goes with it, and continue to take on work from an increasingly growing pool. The potential downside of this choice could be a further strain on resources resulting in reduced quality of work product – an outcome to be avoided for any lawyer. The third outcome is the most likely, as early indicators are signaling in its direction: full-time equivalent (FTE) growth increases as firms flood the market with recruiting dollars and larger salaries to attract the potential wave of associates expected to enter the market soon. In other words, the already hot legal labor market goes nuclear. No matter which way this turns out, corporate’s Q2 2021 performance is already locked in. This was a quarter in which the practice area played the leading role in powering the overall legal market to an all-time high, a performance which in contrast to its co-stars’ opportunism, was all its own brilliance.

"Italy reports 69 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, 6,503 new cases",946,"ROME, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Italy reported 69 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, down from 75 the previous day, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 6,503 from 5,498, the health ministry said. A total of 129,290 deaths linked to COVID-19 have been registered in Italy since its outbreak emerged in February last year. That is the second-highest tally in Europe behind Britain and the ninth-highest globally. Italy has reported 4.55 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 4,231 on Wednesday, down from 4,252 a day earlier. There were 40 new admissions to intensive care units, decreasing from 49 on Tuesday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 540 from a previous 544.

"U.S. childcare in short supply as burned-out workers quit, new hires hard to find",7068,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Rochelle Wilcox, the owner of three childcare centers in New Orleans, receives 10 to 15 phone calls nearly every day for each school from parents asking if there is space for their children. But Wilcox has to turn them away. While her enrollment is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, she doesn't have the staff to take on more students. ""I have to say that we’re full,"" said Wilcox, who capped the wait list for the three schools at 140 children, compared to the more typical range of 45 to 60. She estimates the schools could accept nearly 40 more children if she could hire 10 more staffers. Childcare centers across the country are struggling to find enough qualified educators to be fully staffed for back-to-school season, an obstacle that has some schools reducing planned enrollment and cutting back hours. Owners of childcare centers say more workers are quitting and fewer people than usual are applying for open positions. The staffing crunch is further limiting childcare options for parents eager to get back to work. It also creates more hurdles for working mothers, who were disproportionately pushed out of the labor market when schools went virtual and childcare centers closed because of the pandemic. Without reliable childcare, it will become more difficult for those parents to return to steady work schedules, economists say, potentially slowing a labor market recovery that many had hoped would get a jolt as schools reopened this fall and which becomes even more critical as enhanced jobless benefits expire in September. Research released on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that women with children under age 6 made up 10% of the workforce before the pandemic but accounted for 22% of the jobs lost during the crisis. The ability to find quality childcare is ""likely to be a determining factor for employment"" for women with young children, Atlanta Fed researcher M. Melinda Pitts wrote in the report. Four out of five early childhood educators working at childcare centers said they were understaffed in late June and early July, according to a survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. More than one in three respondents said they were thinking about leaving or shutting down their centers this year. Recruiting childcare workers has always been difficult because wages are typically low - workers earn a median of $12 an hour according to the Labor Department - and the work is demanding. But those challenges were exacerbated by the pandemic, which put workers' health at risk and, with many quitting, created greater responsibilities for those who remained on the job. The renewed focus on the workforce is leading to a national conversation about early childhood educators and what needs to change to provide them with more opportunities and reduce turnover. ""I think what we’re going through right now is a revaluing of care work and understanding that care work is the work that makes all other work possible,"" said Mara Bolis, associate director of women's economic rights for Oxfam America. BURNING OUT Employment of child daycare workers plunged by 36% at the start of the pandemic after many centers shut down, greater than the roughly 15% drop in employment seen in the U.S. labor market overall, according to Labor Department data. Childcare employment was still down 11% from pre-pandemic levels as of July, compared to a 4% shortfall for the labor market overall. Some workers leaving the industry now say they are worried about the health risks or are burning out after being asked to work longer hours with less support. Some people are moving into more lucrative roles as nannies, which came into higher demand during the pandemic with daycare centers shuttering and as more families opted to keep their children at home. Amanda Chugg worked through the early part of the pandemic at a childcare center based in a hospital campus in Portland, Oregon. But she left in May of 2020 because too many of her colleagues were showing up to work sick and she was concerned about exposing her roommate, who is immunocompromised, to COVID-19. ""Having people coming to work sick is not uncommon in childcare,"" said Chugg, 26, who now works as a nanny taking care of two children, ages four and six. ""But with the onset of COVID it got to a place where it was untenable for me."" Jordan Potts, 21, realized it was time for a change after being asked to work multiple 12-hour shifts because the center she worked at in north Texas was short-staffed. Many of the teachers hired to help would leave after a week or two. ""It kind of clicked, the burnout,"" said Potts, who quit in August after about three years in the industry. Instead of caring for a room of about 10 one-year olds, Potts is now working as a full-time nanny caring for a five-month old baby. While her pay is about the same, her responsibilities as a nanny are more manageable, said Potts, who will start college in January and wants to be an elementary school teacher. SEEKING SOLUTIONS Owners of childcare centers say they want to boost wages to retain more workers. But they argue they are limited in terms of how much more they can offer before they have to start raising tuition - putting more pressure on families already struggling to afford childcare. That tension is not new, but some childcare center owners feel they are competing more intensely with retailers, restaurants and other businesses that are better able to increase pay or sweeten benefits to attract more workers during the pandemic. Wilcox, the owner of the childcare centers in New Orleans, increased hourly wages for all of her staff this spring, going from a range of $10 to $13 per hour to a range of $12 to $16. But she still hasn't been able to fill all of her openings. In addition to better wages, early childhood educators say they need more opportunity for growth within the field, support from staff and broader access to health insurance, sick time and other benefits. Megan Ahern initially envisioned she would spend her evenings coming up with creative lesson plans when she started teaching pre-Kindergarten full-time in Eugene, Oregon, in September of 2020. But after struggling to afford groceries on her teacher paycheck alone, the 25-year-old started delivering food through Uber Eats after school. She worked close to 12 hours a day between the two jobs. Ahern, who quit the school at the end of August, said she didn't have the resources needed for her classroom, which included some children with special needs. Some of the children would hit, bite or pee on her. She was so overwhelmed she often found herself shedding tears during her 30-minute lunch breaks. Ahern's pay was increased to $17 an hour from $13 an hour in early August, but it wasn't enough to change her mind. ""Ideally I’ll be able to come back to working with kids at some point,"" said Ahern, who plans to keep delivering food until she finds another job. ""But I just need a break.""

"'Oh, that's an idea...': U.S. parents respond to China screen time ban",3076,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - (This 31st August story corrected a spelling error in paragraph 4) Raleigh Smith Duttweiler was folding laundry in her Ohio home, her three children playing the video game Minecraft upstairs, when she heard an NPR story about new rules in China that forbid teenagers and children under age 18 from playing video games for more than three hours a week. ""Oh, that's an idea,"" Duttweiler, who works in public relations at a nonprofit, recalls thinking. ""My American gut instinct: This is sort of an infringement on rights and you don't get to tell us what to do inside of our own homes. ""On the other hand, it's not particularly good for kids to play as much as even my own children play. And I do think it would be a lot easier to turn it off if it wasn't just arguing with Mommy, but actually saying 'Well, the police said so.'"" For Duttweiler and many families outside of China, Monday's news of the country's strict social intervention - which regulators said was needed to stop a growing addiction to what it once described as ""spiritual opium"" - underscores a challenge to rein in video game use in their own homes, particularly during the pandemic. China's regulator said the new rules were a response to growing concern that games affected the physical and mental health of children, a fear echoed by parents and experts in the United States. Paul Morgan, a father of two teenagers and Penn State professor who studies electronic device use, sees flaws in the ban while acknowledging the challenge of controlling children's screen time. ""These electronic devices are ubiquitous,"" Morgan said. ""It's really hard to get kids away from them."" Yet Morgan says negative associations with screen time are particularly evident for heavy users, possibly due to displacing activities like exercise or sleep. The ban doesn't address social media use, which is thought to be especially harmful for girls. And some populations, such as students with disabilities, may benefit from the social interactions provided by video games. Shira Weiss, a New Jersey-based publicist for technology clients including a video game company, sees value in the games that help keep her twin 12-year-old sons connected to their peers, but wants to better limit how often they play the more violent games. ""I think the Chinese rules are good,"" Weiss said. ""You're still saying 'Play video games,' but you're just setting limits."" She added, partially joking: ""Can they come here and impose that restriction on my house?"" Michael Gural-Maiello, who works in business development at an engineering firm and has an 11-year-old son, believes parents should be the ones regulating their children's video game use. ""I don't think governments really have a place in telling parents how their children should be spending their time,"" Gural-Maiello said. ""China has a rotten record in technology in general. I'd be far more worried about my son using apps that originate in China that collect data than I am about him playing Mario Kart."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Cuba prepares to vaccinate its children, entire population",2617,"HAVANA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Cuba will begin vaccinating adolescents against COVID-19 this week and younger children from mid-September as part of a drive to immunize more than 90% of the population by December, state-run media said on Wednesday. All children ages 2 through 18 will receive at least two doses of the Cuban-developed Soberana-2 vaccine beginning Sept. 3, the official Cubadebate digital news outlet reported. Health Ministry official Ileana Morales Suarez was quoted as saying the campaign would resemble annual vaccinations against various childhood diseases, taking place at thousands of community-based family medical practices and clinics. Trials of the vaccine in minors found it to be safe and that it elicited a stronger immune response than in adults, according to state-owned manufacturer Finlay Institute. The decision was announced at a weekly meeting of leaders and scientists to confront the pandemic on the Communist-run Caribbean island currently battling a Delta variant-driven surge that has strained its health system and hit the younger population much harder than previous versions of the virus. Over the past week, Cuba averaged between 6,500 and 7,000 cases per day and 70 to 80 deaths, down significantly from a few weeks ago but still one of the highest rates in the world in terms of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Vaccination of the adult population primarily using another locally-developed shot, Abdala, will be stepped up with the goal of ensuring all eligible adults have at least begun the three-shot-treatment by the end of the month. Cubans are desperate to get their kids back in school after months of home schooling, a prospect postponed again this September. The country is suffering shortages of everything from food and medicine to parts and inputs for power plants and agriculture, due to closure of the tourism industry, tough U.S. sanctions and its own inefficiencies. It desperately wants to tame the disease in time for the tourism season that begins in November. Both Cuban vaccines, with a reported efficacy of more than 90%, have been approved by local regulators for emergency use, although the data has not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. In the capital, Havana, where more than 60% of the 2.2 million residents are fully vaccinated, cases and deaths per 100,000 residents are far below the national average, according to government statistics. Currently around 50% of Cuba's 11.3 million residents have received at least one dose of vaccine, with more than 3.5 million fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Well-vaccinated countries should prioritise COVAX over booster shots - WHO's Tedros,900,"BERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation recommends against using spare doses of COVID-19 vaccine to give booster shots to countries' fully-vaccinated populations, since the priority is to ensure the global population is vaccinated, the agency's head said. Speaking in Berlin at the opening of a new epidemic intelligence hub, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries with spare vaccines available to donate any deliveries they received in the near term to COVAX or other initiatives aimed at sharing doses with poorer countries. ""For now, we do not want to see widespread use of boosters for healthy people who are fully vaccinated,"" he said. ""We call on countries that have contracted high volumes of vaccines to swap near-term delivery schedules with COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, or AVAT.""

"Italy extends COVID-19 Green Pass to trains, planes, ferries and coaches",2073,"ROME, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Italy broadened usage of Green Pass health documents on Wednesday, making them obligatory for anyone travelling on high-speed trains, planes, ferries and inter-regional coaches. The Green Pass is a digital or paper certificate that shows whether someone has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, has tested negative or has recently recovered from the virus. Prime Minister Mario Draghi introduced the pass earlier in the summer to try to prevent infections and encourage people to get vaccinated. It was initially needed to enter many cultural and leisure venues, but its scope has gradually been widened. The scheme has triggered protests by some Italians who say it tramples on freedoms, and opponents had vowed to block railway traffic on Wednesday to show their dissent. In the event only a handful of people showed up at the demonstrations. Some 70% of all Italians over the age of 12 are now fully vaccinated and the vast majority of people seem to back the inoculation drive and the use of the Green Pass. ""They are right to ask for a Green Pass. If you don't want to get the vaccine then stay at home and don't travel,"" Rome resident Alessia Colombi said at the city's main train station. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio on Tuesday denounced what he called a ""climate of hatred"" against the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, after he and a number of other politicians and medical experts received threats on social media. read more The government has already said teachers will need a Green Pass when schools reopen this month after the summer holidays. Last week, officials said they were considering extending the scheme to anyone working in a public office or a supermarket. Some 129,221 people have died of coronavirus in Italy since the pandemic hit last year, the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain. New cases held relatively steady in August, but doctors fear the more contagious Delta variant could cause a fresh spike in infections in the coming weeks.

"Swiss trainers resign amid abuse allegations, poor performance",2080,"ZURICH, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Trainers for the Swiss Gymnastics Federation's (STV) women's team resigned en masse on Wednesday following an ethics investigation that upheld athletes' complaints of psychological abuse and after a series of poor performances. The ethics committee's report, which was presented to the STV's leadership on Aug. 27 and made public on Wednesday, recommended cutting ties with the coaching staff. ""By mutual agreement, it was decided that the current coaching team would relinquish the leadership of training with immediate effect and be released from their duties,"" the federation said in a statement. The committee's investigation found violations of the Swiss Olympic Ethics Charter during the period from 2016 to 2019 ""and that in particular the mental and physical health of female athletes was not sufficiently protected"". The STV initiated the review in November after two athletes said they had faced harsh training conditions and disparaging comments about their eating habits and body weight. ""I am deeply saddened by the investigation report and apologise on behalf of the STV to those affected for what happened,"" STV Director Beatrice Wertli said. ""The psychological and physical integrity of the athletes is our top priority."" The STV described the resignations as a fresh start for the women's team, which - with the exception of star Guilia Steingruber, a 2016 Rio Olympic Games bronze medallist - had no realistic chance of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

(Reuters) - Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati announced Tuesday that it will extend a series of wellness-related benefits and resources – including offering an extra two weeks of paid time off – to ward off stress from the ongoing pandemic. In addition to its regular vacation plan, the Silicon Valley-founded firm said the extra two weeks comes with billable-hour credit. According to Cherie Beffa, Wilson Sonsini's director of attorney recruiting, the firm is continuingsome wellness initiatives from last June, and that this offer is designed to make its employees ""feel that they can take time to focus on their own well-being."" ""This isn't a vacation. This is 'go take two weeks to do what you need to do and take care of yourself,' and that can be for anything,"" she said. Recognizing that people are struggling with different issues, Beffa added that Wilson Sonsini has partnered with on-demand mental healthcare company Ginger to create an emotional support program that provides free, virtual behavioral health coaches to employees and their dependents. ""The genesis is giving people real-time help when they need it and giving them a vehicle to do that,"" Beffa said. ""And it's been hugely popular. People are using it for different reasons. Sometimes people have serious mental health issues that they need to talk through. Sometimes it's stress management ... it's all different things."" With the Delta variant causing a new surge of COVID-19 cases Wilson Sonsini is also offering both COVID-19 and flu vaccines in its Palo Alto office. As of now, the firm has pushed its office reopening date to October. However, according to Beffa, Wilson Sonsini has continued to provide flexible work arrangements to its employees. ""It's also afforded us the luxury of being able to bring people back to the firm who had left the firm because they moved into a geography that we didn't have an office,"" Beffa added. She also noted that Wilson Sonsini had raised associate salaries to match the new scale set by Davis Polk & Wardwell and kept up with the special bonuses that many large law firms are now to retain and attract young talent. In March, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe unveiled an ""unplugged week"" initiative, which encourages all timekeepers to receive 40 hours of billable credit for taking time off. Orrick in November also announced that its associates caring for children and elderly parents could temporarily work reduced hours at full pay during the pandemic.

Japan finds another Moderna vial suspected to contain foreign substance,2701,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Japan reported a fresh contamination case involving Moderna's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine, the fourth such incident in less than a week, threatening to slow the country's sputtering inoculation campaign. Kanagawa prefecture said on Tuesday several black particles in one Moderna vaccine vial were found upon checking for foreign substances before its use, and it has put the rest of the lot on hold. Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of Moderna shots last week after being notified of contamination in some of the supply. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines, have said the cause could be a manufacturing issue, and European safety regulators have launched an investigation. Moderna has said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified from the issue. No similar Moderna incident has been reported in other countries. Kanagawa prefecture said the vaccine's domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T), had collected the vial with the suspected contaminant and that about 3,790 people had already received shots from the same lot. More Moderna shots were temporarily halted in two other regions this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off when needles are incorrectly inserted. Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kanagawa incident. The company posted a notice on its website on Wednesday saying that on rare occasions during manufacturing, rubber stopper material can get mixed into the vaccine solution. Japan's health ministry, citing an investigation by Takeda, said on Wednesday that the vial sent to Kanagawa was from a different lot than the other lots, and rubber stopper material appears to have gone into it during the manufacturing process. Rovi did not have an immediate comment to a Reuters' request for an update on its investigation. Medical staff are advised to do a visual inspection of vials for discoloration or foreign materials before use, the notice said. The contamination incidents come as Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with daily infections exceeding 25,000 in August for the first time. Tokyo reported on Wednesday 3,168 more cases, with NHK citing 20,031 new cases nationwide. Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 45.4% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Oxford Nanopore to launch $3.4 bln London IPO in coming weeks - sources,1807,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Oxford Nanopore, a provider of rapid COVID-19 tests to the UK’s national health service, is working with banks to launch an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange in the coming weeks - a deal that would strengthen Britain's efforts to lure life science businesses to its main market. The company aims to build on the 2.48 billion pounds ($3.42 billion) valuation achieved in a funding round in May, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Oxford-based life sciences firm, which counts IP Group and Singapore's Temasek among its shareholders, provides DNA/RNA sequencing technology for sectors such as biomedical, pathogen, plant and animal scientific research, infectious diseases and food and agriculture. It has also worked on rapid COVID-19 tests. The deal will add to a crowded pipeline of share sales expected to launch in London and other European centres in the last IPO window of the year as 2021 looks set for record volumes of new listings, dominated by tech and e-commerce businesses. The Oxford Nanopore listing is a major win for London's main market as most biotech firms typically list on the LSE's junior AIM bourse before floating on Nasdaq - home to some of the world's biggest drugmakers - after reaching a certain size. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. Bank of America (BAC.N), Citi (C.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) are global coordinators for the London listing. In May, Oxford Nanopore held a 195 million pound funding round that saw Temasek, Wellington Management, M&G Investments and Nikon becoming new investors in the company.

English study finds long COVID affects up to 1 in 7 children months after infection,2032,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As many as 1 in 7 children may have symptoms linked to the coronavirus months after testing positive for COVID-19, the authors of an English study on long COVID in adolescents said on Wednesday. Children rarely become severely ill with COVID-19 but they can suffer lingering symptoms, and the study is one of the largest of its kind on how common so-called long COVID is in the age group. The study, led by University College London and Public Health England, found that 11- to 17-year-olds who tested positive for the virus were twice as likely to report three or more symptoms 15 weeks later than those who had tested negative. Researchers surveyed 3,065 11- to 17-year-olds in England who had positive results in a PCR test between January and March, and a control group of 3,739 11- to 17-year-olds who tested negative over the same period. Among those who tested positive, 14% reported three or more symptoms such as unusual tiredness or headaches 15 weeks later, compared with 7% reporting symptoms by that time among the control group. The researchers said that while the findings suggested as many as 32,000 teenagers might have had multiple symptoms linked to COVID-19 after 15 weeks, the prevalence of long COVID in the age group was lower than some had feared last year. ""Overall, it's better than people would've guessed back in December,"" Professor Terence Stephenson of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, told reporters. The findings were a pre-print which had not been peer-reviewed. The authors said that any decision to extend vaccination to 12- to 15-year-olds in Britain was unlikely to be based on this study as there was not enough data on whether vaccination protects against long COVID. ""We are getting increasing evidence on the safety of the vaccine in the 12- to 15-year-olds and that's more likely to be taken into consideration,"" Liz Whittaker, a paediatrician at Imperial College London, told reporters.

China ramps up healthcare reform with pilot pricing scheme,2217,"BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China stepped up its reform of public healthcare service pricing mechanisms with the announcement of a pilot programme aimed at ensuring proper compensation for service providers and affordable costs for consumers. The plan comes after China had blocked some channels that allowed public hospitals to earn revenues from medical devices and drug sales. The measure reduced over-prescription and illegal rebates but also increased public healthcare operators' reliance on medical services to support their staff. The new scheme is also aimed at rectifying weaknesses in current pricing mechanisms, where some services are priced too low and medical professionals do not participate in the government's price-setting process sufficiently. ""(Price increase) will be inevitable to make sure doctors' income remains reasonable,"" said Zhao Bing, a China Renaissance Securities analyst, noting reduced revenue streams for public healthcare operators due to restrictions in sales of drugs and medical devices. Zhao said the rule does not necessarily mean consumer costs will also increase, as state insurance will help cover the bill. The pilot programme guideline will specify how public hospitals should adjust service prices and involve both increases and decreases, but will avoid excessive increases in costs, according to the guideline issued late on Wednesday. The government plans to start the pilot programme in five cities before national launch by 2025, the guideline said. Under the scheme, authorities will set guide pricing for most services at public institutions, and services eligible for market-driven pricing will be limited. Private hospitals will be allowed to use market-driven pricing plans, but China will strengthen its regulation and, when necessary, take action such as pricing investigations, summoning hospital operators and public disclosure of price irregularities, according to the guideline. Shares in private service provider Aier Eye Hospitals Group (300015.SZ) fell as much as 4.4% on Wednesday before closing 1.4% higher.

The video conferencing company issued a dour forecast of 31% rise in third-quarter revenue compared with the multiple-fold growth rates seen last year amid remote work and schooling. Its shares have nearly halved in value compared to their peak in October last year as the pandemic-boom started to fade. Meanwhile, the $25.5 billion ARKK is down about 2% for the year, clawing back from losses of about 22%. Separately, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF.P) added about $11.5 million shares of Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD.O).

Portugal lifts COVID-19 travel ban on tourists from Brazil,1553,"LISBON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Portugal said on Wednesday it would allow entry for tourists from Brazil, nearly 18 months after it imposed a ban on non-essential travel from the Portuguese-speaking South American nation to stem the spread of coronavirus. Although Brazilians, who make up Portugal's biggest expatriate community, were allowed access for reasons such as work, family or health, the lifting of the tourism ban has been long-awaited. Portugal is now open to tourists from the European Union who present the bloc's digital COVID-19 certificate, as well as the United States, from where visitors must show a negative test result on arrival.

"Frenchwoman officially considered dead fights to be ""alive"" again",3348,"SAINT-JOSEPH, France, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Declared dead by a French court in 2017, Jeanne Pouchain has spent the past four years trying to escape a bewildering legal twilight zone and prove to officialdom that she is in fact very much alive. She says the experience has been devastating. ""My name was Jeanne. It still is Jeanne, after I've been declared dead in 2017,"" says the 59-year old, smoking cigarette after cigarette. She breaks into tears at times when recounting her ordeal - and what she plans for when she will officially be ""alive"" again. It all started, Pouchain recalls, when the family received a letter four years ago from a court saying mistakenly that she was dead and that her husband and son had to pay for money she was alleged to have owed. The letter was part of a complicated legal procedure launched by a former employee of Pouchain's cleaning business and, unlike what they had assumed at first, it was not easy, or quick, to clear up the error. Pouchain, unable to work and afraid to leave her house because she had no valid ID or social security number anymore, started living as a recluse. Some of the family's belongings were seized by court bailiffs, while all their savings, and more, went into trying to get things back to normal. ""My life, well, it's nothing. I feel I'm of no use. I'm nothing and I'm of no use. And this is hard,"" Pouchain says, speaking to Reuters in the house she shares with her husband Pierre-Jean in a small village near Lyon, in south-east France. But with the courts looking at her case again, Pouchain and her husband have begun to have some hope again. Although it may still be months before her bid to get the case against her revised, and for a judge to officially recognise that she is not dead and should never have been considered dead, she has drawn up a list of what she wants to do when that happens. Jeanne Pouchain poses with her husband Pierre-Jean Pouchain during an interview with Reuters at her home, detailing the ordeal she has been leaving through since being declared dead by a judge, in Saint-Joseph, near Lyon, August 30, 2021. REUTERS/Cecile Mantovani After years of hardships, the priority will be her health. ""I know exactly what I will do ... I will get a health check, because I know some things are wrong with my body,"" she said, adding that, because she could not get proper treatment for lack of a valid social security card, she has only six teeth left, among a series of health issues. ""I would so love to be able to bite into an apple ... I would love to have teeth. I would be so happy, even if they were to give me two dentures, I would be happy to have teeth."" Her other dream is simply to be able to enjoy life again, at home, with her husband. ""During the day, I manage to feel more or less alive, but my nights are awful. I wake up after an hour and a half because it haunts my nights,"" she said. Her husband, Pierre-Jean Pouchain, while speaking of how hard this all has been, also wants to be optimistic. ""Hope is what makes us carry on,"" he said. ""Eventually, the outcome will necessarily be in our favour."" ""It will take the time that is needed,"" he added, ""but we're not asking for something extraordinary ... on some things there can be doubts but, between dead or alive, there is no doubt.""

No tougher Swiss coronavirus curbs for now despite rising cases,2136,"ZURICH, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Switzerland will not tighten curbs on public life for now despite rising coronavirus cases, the government said on Wednesday, reserving the right to make people show a COVID-status certificate to access many indoor spaces. The government had signalled such a move last week when it ordered millions more doses of COVID-19 vaccine for possible use as booster shots,amid concerns that a rising number of serious cases could soon overwhelm hospitals. read more ""The number of hospital admissions of coronavirus patients remains high, but has not increased in the last week. Therefore, the (cabinet) has not yet decided (on widening use of certificates) today,"" a government statement said on Wednesday. It would decide on measures to relieve hospitals ""at any time should this become necessary"", it added. The certificate provides proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test result. President Guy Parmelin acknowledged at a news conference in Bern that the government's plans had provoked a lively debate about how far it should intrude into people's lives, but appealed for national unity. ""The enemy remains the virus, not fellow citizens of a different opinion,"" he said. The number of new infections in Switzerland and tiny neighbour Liechtenstein has picked up again to surpass 780,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll has exceeded 10,500. Just over half the Swiss population has been fully vaccinated, Health Minister Alain Berset said last week, but a third of adults remained unjabbed. He pointed to lower vaccination rates than in neighbouring countries. The government also unveiled an extra 60 million Swiss francs ($65.5 million) in support for the hard-hit tourism sector, aiming to boost demand and encourage innovation. The state is providing around 17 billion francs in coronavirus relief in 2021, around the same as in 2020. That has helped pushed the public sector financing deficit to around 2.2% of economic output this year. Public finances are set to return to the black next year.

Pandemic accelerates depletion of U.S. Social Security trust funds -Treasury,1819,"WASHINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will cause the main U.S. Social Security trust fund reserves to be depleted in 2033, a year sooner than an estimate made a year ago, as a steep drop in employment shrank revenue, the U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday. The Treasury said the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which pays retirement benefits, would be able to pay 76% of scheduled benefits after 2033 from continuing payroll tax revenues. Social Security's separate Disability Insurance Trust Fund will see its reserves depleted in 2057, eight years sooner than last year's estimate. Combined, the two Social Security trust fund reserves will be depleted in 2034, a year earlier than the estimate made a year ago, Treasury said. The Medicare Hospital Insurance Fund reserves are expected to be depleted in 2026, the same as last year's estimate. This will allow Medicare to pay only 91% of scheduled ""Part A"" hospital and other benefits from expected revenues at that time, Treasury said. Part of the reason for the stable depletion date is the higher mortality rate from COVID-19, which reduces some long-term care costs, offset by higher expected healthcare costs for people weakened by the virus, a Department of Health and Human Services official told reporters. Annual reports on both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds again said that congressional action will be needed in coming years to shore up the programs financially, by increasing revenue, cutting benefits, or finding other cost savings. An added twist to this year's Social Security report is a 3.1% estimated upward cost-of-living adjustment for benefits in 2021, the highest in a decade, due to higher inflation rates caused in part by supply shortages during the pandemic.

Rwandan president removes justice minister amid 'Hotel Rwanda' hero trial,2280,"KIGALI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Rwanda's President Paul Kagame has removed the justice minister but made him ambassador to Britian amid international scrutiny over the trial of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier credited with saving many lives during the 1994 genocide. A government statement issued on Tuesday gave no reason for the dismissal of Johnston Busingye, who had served as justice minister and attorney general since 2013. Busingye was appointed Rwanda's ambassador to Britain, the statement said. Kagame did not immediately name a new justice minister. Requests for comment to government spokespeople and the presidency office were not answered. Rusesabagina was hailed as hero after he used his connections as the manager of a Kigali hotel to save ethnic Tutsis from slaughter during the genocide. He was portrayed in the 2004 Hollywood film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Now he is accused of nine terrorism-related charges, including forming and funding an armed rebel group. Before his arrest, Rusesabagina, who was living in the United States, was a vocal critic of the Kagame government. Prosecutors have requested a life sentence for Rusesabagina, whose family says he is in poor health and being mistreated in prison. The court is scheduled to issue its verdict on Sept. 20. In an interview with Qatar-based Al Jazeera news channel in February, then Minister Busingye said the government had paid for the flight that brought Rusesabagina to Rwanda last year, which Rusesabagina's family said resulted in his kidnapping. Rusesabagina's trial has drawn attention to Kagame, whom rights groups say has used authoritarian tactics to crush political opposition and extend his rule. The government's arrest of Rusesabagina amounted to an enforced disappearance, a serious violation of international law, New York-based Human Rights Watch said at the time. Kagame became head of state in 2000 after he and his rebel forces halted the genocide in 1994 after 100 days of bloodletting and around 800,000 deaths of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. ​ He won landslide victories in subsequent elections, the most recent in 2017, when he won nearly 99% of the vote. He changed the constitution in 2015, enabling him to rule legally until 2034. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
UK regulator clears broadcaster over Piers Morgan's Meghan comments,2483,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - High-profile television personality Piers Morgan did not breach Britain's broadcasting code in his criticism of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" show earlier this year, Britain's media regulator ruled on Wednesday. The programme in March, in which Morgan said he did not believe a word Meghan had said in a landmark interview she and her husband Prince Harry gave to Oprah Winfrey, attracted more than 50,000 complaints. Most concerned comments Morgan made on mental health and suicide. Meghan, who during the Winfrey interview revealed she had felt suicidal while living as a royal in Britain,complained to both Ofcom and ITV about the programme. Morgan left his jobon the show following the incident. read more ""Our decision is that overall the programme contained sufficient challenge to provide adequate protection and context to its viewers,"" Ofcom said. In an interview that shook Britain's monarchy, Meghan, a Hollywood actor who married Prince Harry in 2018, said the royal family had also rejected her pleas for mental health support. The couple have stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States. Morgan, a former presenter on CNN, has accused the couple of damaging the royal family and seeking publicity on their own terms without accepting the responsibility and scrutiny that come with their position. He had also dubbed her ""Princess Pinocchio"" in a tweet. ""I'm delighted OFCOM has endorsed my right to disbelieve the Duke & Duchess of Sussex’s incendiary claims to Oprah Winfrey, many of which have proven to be untrue,"" Morgan said on Twitter. ""This is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios. Do I get my job back?"" A U.S.-based spokesperson for the Sussexes was not immediately available for comment out of working hours. Ofcom said that while it was concerned about Morgan's apparent disregard for the seriousness of anyone expressing suicidal thought, the extensive challenge offered by his colleagues throughout the show provided sufficient context. The broadcasting code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views, including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive, Ofcom said. ""The restriction of such views would, in our view, be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience,"" it said.

Chinese EV maker Nio cut sales forecast due to chip supply shortage,2092,"BEIJING, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc (NIO.N) on Wednesday cut its delivery forecast for the third quarter this year due to uncertain and volatile semiconductor supplies. Nio cut its delivery forecast for the third quarter to around 22,500 to 23,500 vehicles from a previous 23,000-25,000 vehicles. It delivered 5,880 electric sports-utility vehicles last month, up 48% from a year earlier. Li Auto Inc (L87Ay.F), which sells extended-range electric vehicles, said it sold 9,433 vehicles last month, up 248% from a year earlier. It targets 10,000 units monthly sales in September. Xpeng Inc (9868.HK), sold 7,214 cars in August, up 172% year-on-year. Its chief executive He Xiaopeng said it expects monthly deliveries to reach 15,000 units in the final quarter this year. A prolonged global chip shortage has caught major automakers including Ford Motor (F.N), Honda Motor (7267.T), General Motors (GM.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) off guard, forcing many to idle or curtail production. The shortage was unlikely to resolve soon as the pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, China's top auto industry body said last month. read more U.S. listed shares of Nio were down 4.3% at $37.63 in premarket trading, while Xpeng fell more than 2%.

Hair cuts and dining in as Thai malls reopen after virus cases ease,1886,"BANGKOK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Thailand allowed shopping malls in the capital Bangkok to reopen on Wednesday and restaurants to operate at half capacity, after nearly three months of tough restrictions aimed at containing the country's worst coronavirus outbreak. The move comes after infections numbers started falling in the middle of last month and with the government under pressure to ease lockdown measures due to the impact on the economy. ""Thai citizens like me...will come back to normal life,"" said Wanvipa Luepromchian, who was getting her hair cut in a salon in the Siam Paragon mall in Bangkok. The government in Julystarted imposing strict measures including closing malls and prohibiting restaurant dining as the number of new infections surged due to the Delta variant. At its peak, authorities reported over 23,000 new cases in a single day in mid-August. On Wednesday, the health ministry reported 14,802 new cases and 252 additional deaths. Thailand has overall reported 1.2 million cases and 11,841 fatalities. ""If you (the government) lockdown everything that's so dangerous for the economy in Thailand,"" Wanvipa said. Last week, the government also allowed some domestic flights to resume. Restaurants dining can also restart, but at half the capacity to allow for social distancing. ""Customers need to get temperatures checked before entering and keep social distancing with only two people on one table, but if they are family, they can be seated together,"" said restaurant manager Nichapha Jiwvaganont. While a night time curfew remains in place in Bangkok, the partial reopening will be supportive for Thailand's struggling economy. A joint business group on Wednesday raised its 2021 economic forecast from between a 0.5% contraction to 1% growth from a contraction of 1.5% to 0% growth as curbs were relaxed.

COVID vaccine mandates - and prizes - boost uptake among Palestinians,2303,"GAZA/RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept 1 (Reuters) - After mandating vaccinations for workers and many students - and offering prize money - to nudge a sceptical public to get the jab, Palestinian officials report a big boost in vaccine uptake they hope will stem a surge in COVID-19 infections. Officials in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank announced the new rules last week after many shunned the vaccine due to misinformation online - even as authorities accumulated enough doses to cover most Palestinians over 12. read more In addition to mandating jabs for public sector workers and those in jobs dealing with the public, as well as teachers and students above 15, Gaza now offers a chance at $200 - a hefty sum for Palestinians in the impoverished territory - to anyone over 50 who gets inoculated. Ten winners are chosen daily. More Palestinians in Gaza have taken the vaccine in the past week - some 133,000 - than in the entire six-month period prior, health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. The West Bank has registered a similar jump in vaccinations. Samer Al-Asad, a Palestinian Authority (PA) health ministry official in the West Bank, attributed the increased uptake to ""people's desire to go back to normal life...The vaccine is the only and shortest way to curb the spread of the virus."" Despite the recent boost, however, just 19.5% of Palestinians in Gaza and 41% in the West Bank are vaccinated, according to PA health ministry data. Officials privately worry the current increases will eventually taper off. New infections in the West Bank and Gaza have surged since the global emergence of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. PA health officials began administering vaccines in West Bank schools this week to keep up the momentum. At one school in the village of Dura, near Hebron, 11th-grader Youssef Sharif said he trusted the science behind the jab. ""Scientists won't do anything unless they are sure of it. In my opinion, everyone should get vaccinated,"" he said. At a Gaza vaccination centre, Hassan Al-Farana said he was initially sceptical but decided to get the jab after some of his family members did so. ""We got vaccinated, and we found it wasn't harmful,"" the 43-year-old Palestinian said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealanders venture out as COVID-19 curbs eased in most regions,2354,"WELLINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - New Zealanders on Wednesday visited beaches and queued for takeaway food as tough lockdown measures enforced to beat an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus were eased for most of the country.

REUTERS/Fiona Goodall Except for a small number of cases in February, New Zealand was largely coronavirus-free until the outbreak of the Delta variant prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. The country reported 75 new cases of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, up from 49 a day earlier. Of those, 74 were in Auckland and one was a household contact in Wellington. The total cases from the current outbreak rose to 687, nearly all in Auckland. ""The latest bounce in numbers is not unexpected,"" the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference, adding it was still below the peak daily number. Ardern's lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, have been credited with reining in COVID-19 allowing the country to live largely without restrictions. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israeli students return to school amid surge in COVID-19 cases,2490,"JERUSALEM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Israeli pupils returned to school on Wednesday with mask requirements and mandatory COVID-19 testing aimed at stemming a surge in coronavirus cases that has overshadowed the highly-vaccinated country's reopening. Health officials worry the launch of a new school year - with most students attending in-person - will exacerbate the current wave ahead of this month's Jewish holiday season, potentially forcing another national lockdown. New infections have soared since the emergence of the Delta variant, reaching a pandemic-high 10,947 on Tuesday among Israel's 9.3 million population. Under what he calls a ""living with COVID"" policy, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has pressed ahead with the new school year, in part by ramping up vaccine booster shots and requiring testing for students and unvaccinated instructors. Visiting a school in Israel's Negev desert, Bennett said the testing effort - some 2 million tests were conducted - was the largest in Israel's history. ""After a year of Zooming, a difficult year of fading and staring in front of the screens, I want to wish you, the students of Israel, this one thing: May the year of screens be done away, and a year of experiences begin,"" Bennett said. But Bennett's government announced the new measures just days before classes resumed, drawing criticism from parents who say they were given little time to prepare. Gal Altberg said she was excited to send her children, in 1st and 3rd grade, back to school but worried there might still be a lockdown amid the rise in infections. ""The policy is still up in the air, the government changes things around but we are hoping for (the best), and we are hoping that the vaccinations will help,"" Altberg, 41, said. Students under 12 - the minimum age of eligibility for the vaccine - must present their teachers with a parent's note confirming they performed a rapid test at home and received a negative result. Such testing is not required beyond the first day. But officials say further testing could be done before or after the Jewish holidays, where large family gatherings are common. The first of those festivals is on Sept. 6 and the last on Sept. 30. In areas with particularly high infection, schools where less than 70% of students are vaccinated are required to conduct remote learning. Around 10% of Israeli students will attend school online on Wednesday, according to the YNet news website. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Warnings as Southeast Asia's biggest economies ease COVID-19 curbs,3138,"BANGKOK/JAKARTA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - As Indonesia and Thailand start to ease COVID-19 curbs after seeing case numbers fall, health experts say cases of new infections could rise again with vaccination rates still low. After containing the coronavirus better than much of the world last year, Southeast Asia has turned into a global epicentre in recent months with the arrival of the virulent Delta variant. Although case numbers are still rising fast in most of the region, Indonesia and Thailand, which have its largest economies, have started to lift curbs on dine-in restaurants and shopping malls to ease the economic pain of their lockdowns. Indonesia reported 10,534 new cases on Tuesday, five times fewer than its peak in mid-July, while Thailand reported 14,802 new cases on Wednesday, down 37% from its mid-August peak. However, experts said relaxations carried dangers with a low level of vaccination and a shortage of testing, with rates of positive tests often above the 5% recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). ""We are definitely concerned around the reopening without meeting all the criteria proposed by the WHO,"" Abhishek Rimal, Asia Pacific Emergency Health Coordinator at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told Reuters. ""Now with the Delta variant, which is highly transmissible, and the low vaccination rate, we could very well see a surge of COVID-19 in days to come."" Indonesia has recently had a positive test rate of 12% and Thailand 34%. ""Surveillance is not that great, we still need to be careful,"" said Tri Yunis Miko Wahyono, a University of Indonesia epidemiologist. Indonesia has recorded more than 4 million coronavirus cases in total and more than 133,000 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Thailand has reported 11,841 deaths and 1.2 million cases. The two countries both have first vaccination rates at around 30% with Indonesia having fully vaccinated 17% and Thailand 11%. Their capitals, Jakarta and Bangkok, have much higher levels of vaccination. In Jakarta and some areas on the populous Java island, restaurants inside shopping malls could have a 50% dine-in capacity, and shopping malls could stay open until 9 p.m., while factories are permitted to operate at 100% capacity. Bangkok and 28 other provinces listed as having the most severe outbreaks can similarly reopen dine-in restaurants at a capacity between 50%-75%, with opening hours capped at 8 p.m., the same as shopping malls. ""The situation is getting better because many people are getting vaccinated and they are being more cautious,"" said restaurant customer Orrapin Peenanee, queuing in Bangkok. The economic benefits of easing lockdowns were understandable, said Dale Fisher, a senior infectious disease expert at the National University Hospital in Singapore, but he stressed that they also must vaccinate their citizens faster. ""As you ease off the lockdowns, how much sort of punishment can you take before you have to bring a lockdown back in and be and be stronger? The answer's in the vaccine,"" he said.

Philippines health workers protest neglect as COVID-19 strains hospitals,2146,"MANILA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Scores of healthcare workers protested in the Philippine capital on Wednesday to demand an end to what they called government neglect and unpaid benefits, as pressure builds at hospitals fighting one of Asia's longest-running coronavirus epidemics. Protesters wearing protective medical gear gathered at the Department of Health (DOH) and held placards demanding their risk allowances and hazard pay, and the resignation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque. The Philippines passed the 2 million mark in coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a fifth of those recorded in the past month alone. Medical staff are overwhelmed and 103 have died during the pandemic, among some 33,500 coronavirus fatalities overall. ""It is sad that many of us have died, many of us became sick, and many have resigned or opted to retire early, yet we are still kneeling before the DOH to give us our benefits,"" Robert Mendoza, president of the Alliance of Health Workers, said from the back of a pickup truck. President Rodrigo Duterte gave health and budget ministries 10 days from Aug. 21 to pay health workers, following nurses' threats to resign and unions warning of strikes. read more ""The government promised it will give the benefits today but up to now, it has not. I pity us because we are the ones begging,"" said nurse Nico Oba. Duterte has stood by health minister Duque during repeated calls for his resignation, the latest after state auditors flagged ""deficiencies"" in more than $1 billion in COVID-19 spending. read more Duque on Wednesday told Reuters the government was working on the release of benefits but appealed for more time.

China beats Taiwan to the punch in announcing new vaccine delivery,2783,"BEIJING/TAIPEI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - China beat Taiwan to the punch on Wednesday in announcing the delivery timetable for a highly politicised order of COVID-19 vaccines from BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), saying the first 932,000 shots would arrive on the Chinese-claimed island on Thursday. Taiwan has blamed China for blocking an original order from the German firm earlier this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high profile billionaire founder Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the vaccine. A $350 million deal for 10 million doses was signed in July. They will be donated to the government for distribution. In a brief report shortly before Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung begun his daily news briefing in Taipei, China's official Xinhua news agency said the vaccines would leave Luxembourg on Wednesday and were expected to arrive in Taiwan on Thursday morning. It noted the vaccines were being provided by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (600196.SS), which has the right to sell the shots on BioNTech's behalf in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. A second delivery of around 910,000 doses would arrive next week, Xinhua added. The vaccines are made in Germany and are coming from there. Chen told reporters the aircraft had already departed and would arrive early morning on Thursday, though he offered no comment on Xinhua making the announcement before Taiwan's government could. Gou's office said he would be represented at the airport by his cousin Sophie Chang, who is also the wife of TSMC's founder Morris Chang. Gou is currently in quarantine after returning from a trip to Europe. The BioNTech drama has dominated headlines in Taiwan, especially after Gou got involved. Taiwan is getting the shots, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. read more While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order.

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate. An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, fell from July's 61.1 to 59.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth. ""Euro zone manufacturers reported another month of buoyant production in August, continuing the growth spurt into its 14th successive month,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""The overriding issue was again a lack of components, however, with suppliers either unable to produce enough parts or facing a lack of shipping capacity to meet logistics demand."" An ongoing shortage of materials and a lack of transport availability meant sellers of the goods factories need were again able to ramp up their charges. The input prices index thus remained high at 87.0, although shy of July's record 89.2. As a result, factories again sharply increased the prices they charge. Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth. read more The ECB wants inflation at 2% but prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 3.0% in August, fuelled by unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods.

Philips to start replacing millions of respiratory devices,1200,"AMSTERDAM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips (PHG.AS) on Wednesday said it would start repairing and replacing millions of respiratory devices in the United States and most of its other markets this month, to address potential health risks caused by the machines. The company in June recalled up to four million of its respiratory devices and ventilators, as it said a foam part might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer. read more Philips said it had received authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the rework of the affected DreamStation device, allowing it to replace the sound abatement foam with a new material. More than half of the affected machines have been sold in the U.S. and the full replacement effort will take about a year, Philips said. Philips shares have lost about 15% of their value since the recall, as investors fear the possible costs of a number of class action lawsuits that have been launched over the affair.

Britney Spears' lawyer wants father out immediately as conservator,2387,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The father of Britney Spears should step down immediately and without conditions from his role as conservator of her estate, the singer's lawyer said in court documents. Mathew Rosengart, the pop star's lawyer, accused Jamie Spears of trying to link his departure from his 13-year-long role with payment of some $2 million in fees to his attorneys and for experts handling the media. ""Britney Spears will not be extorted,"" Rosengart said in documents filed with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. ""Mr. Spears blatant attempt to barter (his) suspension and removal in exchange for approximately $2 million in payments, on top of the millions already reaped from Ms. Spears’s estate by Mr. Spears and his associates, is a non-starter,"" Rosengart said.

Under conservatorship rules, Britney Spears pays for all costs incurred by her and others. ""Having finally acknowledged that his time as conservator should end, Mr. Spears is obligated to step down without condition and without seeking to extract anything further from his daughter. Indeed, Mr. Spears should resign now and if he does not, this Court must suspend him on September 29th,"" Rosengart said in the filing. The next court hearing in the increasingly contentious case is set for Sept. 29. Jamie Spears has controlled much of his daughter's life since 2008 when she suffered a mental health breakdown.

South Korea in eleventh-hour talks to head off strike by health workers,2640,"SEOUL, Sept 1 (Reuters) - South Korean government officials were in last-ditch efforts on Wednesday to stave off a strike by health workers who say they are exhausted from battling waves of COVID-19 outbreaks and need more personnel and better work conditions. The Korean Health and Medical Worker's Union has warned some of its 80,000 members, including nurses, medical engineers, pharmacists and administrative hospital staff, would begin striking from Thursday if demands are not met. Lee Ki-il, South Korea's deputy minister of health care policy, said at least 104 hospitals out of around 3,400 across the country are set to participate in the strike. ""Most of the 104 hospitals are large major hospitals and designated to treat infectious diseases."" The union said it has not put a timeline on how long the strike might go on. The government and the union have previously met for talks 12 times since May, including a 14-hour marathon session on Monday, but have not been able to find common ground. The union argues its workers are often working double or triple shifts and need better pay and working hours. It is also seeking higher rates of staffing, the establishment of more public hospitals and the introduction of a recommended nurse to patient ratio. The United States has a recommended ratio of 1:5 and Japan has 1:7 while South Korea has none. For its part, the government has said it plans to expand funding for public medicine but demands such as establishing more hospitals could be too expensive and need agreements of many parties on many levels. It was not immediately clear how crippling the strike could be.

Pollution likely to cut 9 years of life expectancy of 40% of Indians,2227,"NEW DELHI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Air pollution is likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40% of Indians by more than nine years, according to a report released by a U.S. research group on Wednesday. More than 480 million people living in the vast swathes of central, eastern and northern India, including the capital, New Delhi, endure significantly high pollution levels, said the report prepared by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). ""Alarmingly, India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time,"" the EPIC report said. For example, air quality has significantly worsened in the western state of Maharashtra and the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it said. Lauding India's National Clean Air Program (NCAP), launched in 2019 to rein in dangerous pollution levels, the EPIC report said ""achieving and sustaining"" the NCAP goals would raise the country's overall life expectancy by 1.7 years and that of New Delhi 3.1 years. The NCAP aims to reduce pollution in the 102 worst-affected cities by 20%-30% by 2024 by ensuring cuts in industrial emissions and vehicular exhaust, introducing stringent rules for transport fuels and biomass burning and reduce dust pollution. It will also entail better monitoring systems. New Delhi was the world's most polluted capital for the third straight year in 2020, according to IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5. Last year, New Delhi's 20 million residents, who breathed some of the cleanest air on record in the summer because of coronavirus lockdown curbs, battled toxic air in winter following a sharp increase in farm residue burning in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana. According to the EPIC's findings, neighbouring Bangladesh could raise average life expectancy by 5.4 years if the country improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organization. To arrive at the life expectancy number, EPIC compared the health of people exposed to different levels of long-term air pollution and applied the results to various places in India and elsewhere.

The need for boosters, however, has not yet been recommended by health regulators.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 31 (Reuters) - A union representing Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) pilots has filed a lawsuit challenging forced time off and other changes to working conditions imposed by the airline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association filed a complaint in federal court in Dallas on Monday claiming that the carrier implemented an ""emergency time off"" program, altered schedules, and scaled back prescription drug and retirement benefits without bargaining, in violation of federal labor law. It claims Southwest should have collectively bargained with the union instead of giving itself ""force majeure"" rights when air travel plummeted during the pandemic. The lawsuit marks an escalation in mounting tensions between the airline and its staff. Its pilots union has threatened to picket over the winter holidays to protest against a host of issues including a gruelling work schedule, a lack of food and accommodation and COVID-19 protocols. The protest prompted the company last week to trim flight schedules for this fall in a bid to better align its operations with staffing. read more In the lawsuit, the union said the airline is bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that lapsed in August last year, but remains in effect until a new agreement is reached and does not contain a ""force majeure"" clause. It asked the court for an injunction, requiring Southwest to stick to the provisions of the lapsed agreement, and negotiate the terms for an ""emergency extended time off"" program, and COVID 19-related work conditions. In an email sent to its members on Tuesday, the union said the lawsuit was the ""only recourse"" to compel the company to meet its duty to collectively bargain. Russell McCrady, Southwest vice president of labor relations, in a statement said that the airline disagrees that any COVID-related changes adopted in recent months required negotiation. ""As always, Southwest remains committed to pilots’ health and welfare and to working with SWAPA, and our other union partners, as we continue navigating the challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic,"" he said.

Idaho reactivates National Guard to help with rising coronavirus cases,1903,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Idaho Governor Brad Little said on Tuesday he was reactivating the National Guard and directing up to 370 additional people to help hospitals as they were overwhelmed with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. There were only four intensive care unit beds available Tuesday in the entire state, out of nearly 400, the governor said in a statement. ""Where hospitals have converted other spaces to be used as contingency ICU beds, those are filling up too,"" Governor Little said. Up to 150 guardsmen will support short-staffed medical facilities and will be tasked with logistical support such as screenings, lab work, and other duties, according to details of the plans to reactivate the National Guard. An additional 200 medical and administrative personnel will be available to Idaho through a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. A 20-person Department of Defense medical response team will be deployed to North Idaho, where vaccination rates are among the lowest in the state, the governor said.

"Brazilian viper venom may become tool in fight against COVID, study shows",2108,"SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian researchers have found that a molecule in the venom of a type of snake inhibited coronavirus reproduction in monkey cells, a possible first step toward a drug to combat the virus causing COVID-19. A study published in the scientific journal Molecules this month found that the molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the virus's ability to multiply in monkey cells by 75%. ""We were able to show this component of snake venom was able to inhibit a very important protein from the virus,"" said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study. The molecule is a peptide, or chain of amino acids, that can connect to an enzyme of the coronavirus called PLPro, which is vital to reproduction of the virus, without hurting other cells. A jararacussu snake, whose venom is used in a study against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is seen at Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil August 27, 2021. Picture taken August 27, 2021. REUTERS/Carla Carniel Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesized in the laboratory, Guido said in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary. ""We're wary about people going out to hunt the jararacussu around Brazil, thinking they're going to save the world ... That's not it!"" said Giuseppe Puorto, a herpetologist running the Butantan Institute's biological collection in Sao Paulo. ""It's not the venom itself that will cure the coronavirus."" Researchers will next evaluate the efficiency of different doses of the molecule and whether it is able to prevent the virus from entering cells in the first place, according to a statement from the State University of Sao Paulo (Unesp), which was also involved in the research. They hope to test the substance in human cells but gave no timeline. The jararacussu is one of the largest snakes in Brazil, measuring up to 6 feet (2 meters) long.

"Judge vets potential Theranos jurors, as COVID-19 looms over start of Holmes trial",4079,"SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug 31 (Reuters) - As Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes' highly anticipated fraud trial began on Tuesday, the judge overseeing the case quizzed potential jurors about whether they could be fair considering the intense media coverage about the entrepreneur, who has long been a subject of fascination in Silicon Valley. Dozens of prospective jurors crowded into a small federal courtroom in San Jose, California, wearing masks and sitting one seat apart to protect against COVID-19. Holmes, 37, has pleaded not guilty to defrauding Theranos investors and patients by falsely claiming that the now-defunct blood testing company had developed technology to run a wide range of tests on a single drop of blood. The meteoric rise and spectacular fall of Theranos turned Holmes from a young billionaire into a defendant who could face years in prison if convicted. When asked on Tuesday if they had been exposed to media coverage of the case, more than a third of the potential jurors raised their hands. At least one had read ""Bad Blood,"" Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou's best-selling book about the Theranos saga. The book chronicles the emergence of the company Holmes started at age 19, concluding that she was a ""manipulator"" whose ""moral compass was badly askew."" Jury pool members who were questioned about that exposure in court largely said it would not affect their ability to be impartial, though several were excused. Known for dressing in a Steve Jobs-style black turtleneck, a masked Holmes wore a black suit in court on Tuesday. The pandemic loomed over the proceedings, with U.S. District Judge Edward Davila assuring jurors about the quality of air filtration in the courtroom. Davila excused nine jurors who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, saying jury service would be a hardship for them. ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes leaves after a hearing at a federal court in San Jose, California, July 17, U.S., 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo The trial is expected to last several months, and Holmes' lawyers have said she may make the unusual move of taking the stand in her own defense, opening herself up to cross-examination by prosecutors. Court papers submitted more than 18 months ago and unsealed late on Friday revealed that Holmes had accused former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani of psychological and sexual abuse. Holmes' lawyers said her ""deference"" to Balwani led her to believe allegedly false statements about parts of Theranos that he controlled, including a claim about a partnership with drugstore chain Walgreens (WBA.O). Holmes was 18 years old when she met Balwani, who is 20 years her senior, and started living with him around three years later, according to Carreyrou's book. Balwani denied allegations of abuse in a 2019 court filing. He is scheduled to be tried separately on fraud charges. Lawyers for Holmes and Balwani did not return requests for comment on Monday. When asked by the judge on Tuesday whether they or someone they knew had experienced domestic violence, five potential jurors raised their hands. One juror said her ex-husband had been abusive toward her. Another, who was dismissed, said his wife was a victim of domestic abuse in a prior relationship. ""Emotionally she is very scarred from it,"" he said, responding to questions from the judge. ""I feel bad for her because it's something she can't shake."" No jurors raised their hand when asked if they knew anyone they thought had been falsely accused of abuse. Christina Marinakis, a jury consultant with litigation consultant IMS, said both sides have likely combed through potential jurors' social media posts for their views about abuse. Marinakis said jurors may be reluctant to admit to a tendency to view a claim of abuse as an ""excuse"" for Holmes' conduct, she added. ""They may fear they are going to be looked at as misogynists,"" she said. Jury selection is scheduled to continue on Wednesday morning, with opening arguments next Tuesday.

Japan's Aug factory activity growth slows on resurgence of COVID-19 - PMI,1883,"TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Japan's factory activity expanded at a slower rate in August as a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Asia disrupted supply chains across the region, sinking overseas orders into contraction for the first time in seven months. Manufacturers withstood the pandemic's hit in part thanks to their positive outlook for the coming twelve months, even as the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant is pushing countries in Asia-Pacific back into lockdown mode. The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in August eased to 52.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 53.0 in the previous month, and up slightly from a 52.4 flash reading. ""A sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in South East Asia was among the key factors listed by Japanese manufacturers for the easing in demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey. ""Severe supply chain disruption partly caused by pandemic restrictions and raw material shortages remained a dampener on production and orders."" The PMI survey showed that overall new orders expanded at their slowest pace since January, while new export orders posted their first contraction since that month. Overall output saw a rise, but its pace eased from the prior month as the intensifying health crisis and a lack of raw materials weighed on production. The survey also showed output for intermediate goods grew at their fastest pace in four-and-a-half years, offsetting weaker demand for investment and consumer products. Input prices maintained a sustained increase, while companies' expectations for the year ahead remained firm, though they eased to the softest since January. ""Though still optimistic, Japanese goods producers were wary of the continued impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruption,"" said Bhatti. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Novartis signs deal with Britain's NHS for new cholesterol drug Leqvio,1944,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Novartis AG (NOVN.S) said on Wednesday it had agreed a deal with Britain's healthcare service provider for use of the drugmaker's new anti-cholesterol drug Leqvio, after the country's healthcare cost agency NICE approved the medicine. The agreement, whose value was not disclosed, will help with wide access to the Swiss drugmaker's medicine through Britain's National Health Service (NHS) for people at risk of heart disease and for whom conventional treatment has not worked. The deal, which builds on a pact signed in 2020, is a win for Novartis after U.S. authorities last year declined to approve the drug, which the drugmaker bought in 2019 for nearly $10 billion and expects to be a top seller. About 300,000 patients at high risk of a second cardiovascular incident are expected to be treated with the medicine over three years, Novartis said on Wednesday. Heart disease is a big killer in Britain and the NHS has made fighting cardiovascular disorders one of its long-term priorities. Britain's NICE, which determines if medicines should be used in the NHS, has recommended Leqvio's use and eligible individuals will be identified via NHS's network. Leqvio, whose chemical generic name is inclisiran, is a twice-yearly injection that targets ""bad cholesterol,"" a culprit behind heart attacks and strokes, and has been approved in Europe. It is an add-on therapy for those patients whose cholesterol levels do not respond adequately to statins. ""Having faster and broader access to a medicine like inclisiran ... is a hugely positive milestone in patient care,"" said Kausik Ray, a professor of public health at Imperial College London and consultant at the imperial college NHS Trust.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 31 (Reuters) - Two women have been charged with selling forged COVID-19 vaccination cards through an Instagram account and to enter the names of customers into New York state's immunization database, prosecutors said on Tuesday. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. charged Jasmine Clifford, 31 of Lyndhurst, New Jersey, and Nadayza Barkley, 27, of Bellport, New York, with offering a false instrument, which is a felony, and misdemeanor conspiracy. Barkley's lawyer Glenn Hardy said his client maintains her innocence and believes she will be vindicated after a full investigation. An attorney for Clifford was not immediately available for comment. Vance also charged 13 hospital, nursing home and medical and nursing school workers with possession of a forged instrument, accusing them of purchasing cards from Clifford. Barkley is accused of entering some of their names in the database. Demand for counterfeit COVID-19 vaccination cards has increased in recent months as more state and local governments, schools and businesses require employees and students to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Vaccines are widely available and free of charge in the United States, where the inoculation rate lags other developed countries as millions choose not to be vaccinated. read more Vance said social media companies such as Facebook (FB.O), which owns Instagram, needs to prevent fraud on their websites. ""The stakes are too high to tackle fake vaccination cards with whack-a-mole prosecutions,"" he said. ""Making, selling, and purchasing forged vaccination cards are serious crimes with serious public safety consequences."" Vance said Clifford, a self-described entrepreneur with several online businesses, began advertising fake COVID-19 vaccination cards on her Instagram account, @AntiVaxMomma, in May. She sold about 250 cards for $200 a piece on the social media site, Vance said. For an additional $250 fee, Barkley, who works at a medical clinic in New York, would enter the buyer's name into the state's database as having received COVID-19 vaccinations.

Detroit highlights the tension over COVID vaccine mandates,3388,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 26 story corrects to remove reference to number of workers represented by unions in paragraph 14. The error occurred in a previous version as well) Public support for stronger measures to require COVID vaccinations is strong, according to a new Reuters/IPSOS poll, but for Detroit automakers the debate over vaccination policy is far from over. General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Thursday it has required its U.S. salaried employees to report whether they have received COVID-19 shots, the first such action by one of Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers. GM said the information will help ""determine when GM should relax or strengthen certain COVID-19 safety protocols as recommended by the CDC and OSHA, such as mask wearing, physical distancing and facility occupancy rates,"" referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Separately, United Auto Workers President Ray Curry on Thursday expressed support for only voluntary measures to encourage vaccination or survey workers' vaccination status. The UAW, with nearly 400,000 members, represents U.S. factory workers at GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Stellantis NV (STLA.MI) as well as workers at other U.S. manufacturers, colleges, government agencies and casinos. ""We would be open to discussion about voluntary efforts,"" Curry said during a videoconference on Thursday. Steps such as GM's plan to gather information about employees' vaccination status would be subject to bargaining before they could be applied to UAW workers, Curry said. Such data collection would raise medical privacy concerns, he said. Likewise, Curry said the UAW would expect companies to negotiate before following the example of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which said it will charge unvaccinated employees an extra $200 a month for company health coverage. ""We have not had an employer reach out to discuss with us"" a vaccine mandate or a penalty for workers who are not vaccinated, Curry said. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds support for employer vaccination requirements. The poll found that 60% of adults support employers who require people to show a proof of vaccination before allowing them to return to the office, while 34% oppose vaccine requirements. The poll, conducted from Aug. 13 to 19, gathered responses from 4,427 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points. About two-thirds of American adults support mask requirements in restaurants, airplanes, gyms and the workplace, while less than one-third oppose them, the poll found. Detroit automakers have reinstated masking requirements in their factories as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has spread. But they have so far not proposed broad measures to require vaccinations. GM has about 48,000 salaried workers in the United States, as per its annual regulatory filing. ""GM earlier this month implemented an expanded vaccination status reporting process that was mandatory for all U.S. salaried employees. We gathered this information via a confidential online tool,"" the company said in a statement. Ford is requiring salaried staff who travel internationally to get vaccinated. ""We are currently assessing whether we need to expand the requirement,"" the company said in a statement. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
3M loses bid to dodge October bellwether trial in earplug mega MDL,3773,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - An upcoming bellwether case over claims that 3M Co's Combat Arms earplugs were defective and led to hearing damage for U.S. military personnel who used them can go to trial as scheduled next month, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers in Pensacola, Florida on Monday denied 3M's motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by Michelle Blum, who served in the U.S. Army Reserves, National Guard and Army between 1989 and 2009, rejecting the company's arguments that her claims were time-barred. Blum's case is set to go to trial on Oct. 18, following another bellwether trial set for Sept. 20. ""We look forward to the next bellwether trial next month, and plan to hold 3M fully accountable for the damage they have caused to those who served our nation,"" plaintiffs' lawyers Bryan Aylstock of Aylstock, Witkin, Kreis & Overholtz; Shelley Hutson of Clark, Love & Hutson; and Christopher Seeger of Seeger Weiss said in a joint statement. ""We are confident in our case and are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves in all upcoming trials,"" 3M spokesperson Fanna Haile-Selassie said in an email. The company is represented by lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis including Hariklia Karis, Nick Wasdin and Mark Nomellini. 3M is facing more than 240,000 claims over the earplugs, known as Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2, which were standard issue for many U.S. military service members between 2003 and 2015. The vast majority of those are consolidated before Rodgers in the largest multidistrict litigation in history. Three bellwether trials have already been held, one of which resulted in a $7.1 million verdict for three plaintiffs and another in a $1.7 million verdict for a single plaintiff, though the jury found 3M only 62% liable in the latter case. 3M was cleared of liability in the third. In moving for summary judgment against Blum, 3M argued that many of her claims, brought under New York law, were barred by the state's three- or four-year limitation periods because she sustained hearing damage in 2009 or earlier but did not bring her claims until 2019. Rodgers, however, wrote that 3M could not rely on the statute of limitations because it was up to the jury to decide whether the company had concealed defects in the earplugs, preventing Blum from bringing timely claims. The judge said there was ""ample record evidence from which a jury could find that defendants affirmatively misrepresented information"" about the earplugs to the military and to soldiers. The ruling came after Rodgers on Friday scheduled five further bellwether trials in November and December, each involving a single plaintiff. Four will be tried by other judges in Rodgers' district, the Northern District of Florida, and a fifth will be tried in Pensacola by a judge from the Northern District of Alabama. Rodgers is presiding over the September and October bellwether trials, as well as another bellwether set for January involving three plaintiffs. The case is In re 3M Combat Arms Earplug Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, No. 19-md-2885.

Indonesia probes suspected data breach on COVID-19 app,1672,"JAKARTA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Indonesia is investigating a suspected security flaw in a COVID-19 test-and-trace app that left exposed personal information and the health status of 1.3 million people, a health ministry official said on Tuesday. Researchers from encryption provider vpnMentor said personal information in the Indonesia Health Alert Card (eHAC) app, often required to be used by travellers, was accessible ""due to the lack of protocols put in place by the app's developers."" Anas Ma'ruf, a health ministry official overseeing data, said the government was looking into the potential breach, but said the potential flaw was in an earlier version of the app, which has not been used since July. ""The eHAC from the old version is different from the eHAC system that is a part of the new app,"" he said. ""Right now, we're investigating this suspected breach"". The eHAC system is now part of the Peduli Lindungi (Care Protect) app, which the government has promoted for various tracing purposes, including entry at malls. Anas urged people to delete the old app and said the breach might have originated from a partner, without elaborating. He said the current eHAC system was now managed by the government and its safety was ""guaranteed"". VpnMentor researchers said the flaw could expose people to phishing or hacking, as well as discourage people from using a COVID-19 tracing app. Experts say such data breaches point to Indonesia's weak cyber security infrastructure. In May, authorities also launched an investigation into an alleged breach of social security data from the country's state insurer. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Explainer: Why and how China is drastically limiting online gaming for under 18s,3622,"BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China on Monday introduced new rules that limit the amount of time under-18s can spend on video games to three hours a week, a move it said was necessary to combat gaming addiction. The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. WHY IS CHINA CONCERNED ABOUT GAMING ADDICTION? Authorities in China, the world's largest video games market, have worried for years about addiction to gaming and the internet among young people, setting up clinics which combine therapy and military drills for those with so-called ""gaming disorders"". Rising rates of nearsightedness were also cited as a concern in 2018. The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the regulator which approves video game titles, said on Monday the new rules were a response to growing concern that games affected the physical and mental health of children. About 62.5% of Chinese minors often play games online, and 13.2% of underage mobile game users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on weekdays, according to state media. Chinese regulators have also targeted the private tutoring industry and what they see as celebrity worship in recent weeks, citing the need to ensure the wellbeing of children. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR? In 2017, Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said it would limit play time for some young users of its flagship mobile game ""Honor of Kings"", a response to complaints from parents and teachers that children were becoming addicted. A boy plays a game on a phone on a street in Shanghai, China August 31, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song A year later, citing concerns over growing rates of myopia, Beijing said it was looking at potential measures to restrict game play by children and suspended video game approvals for nine months. In 2019, it passed laws limiting minors to less than 1.5 hours of online games on weekdays and three hours on weekends, with no game playing allowed between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. It also limited how much minors could spend on virtual gaming items each month, with maximum amounts ranging from $28 to $57, depending on the age. In addition, minors were required to use their real names and national identification numbers when they logged on to play and companies like Tencent and NetEase (9999.HK), set up systems to identify minors. In July, Tencent rolled out a facial recognition function dubbed ""midnight patrol"" that parents can switch on to prevent children from using adult logins to get around the government curfew. WHAT ARE THE NEW CURBS AND HOW WILL CHINA ENFORCE THEM? The new restrictions forbid children under 18 to play online games from Monday through Thursday, effective Sept. 1. They can only play for one hour, between 8 and 9 p.m., on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Online gaming companies must ensure they have put real name verification systems in place, and all titles will eventually need to be connected to an anti-addiction system being set up by the NPPA. NPPA told state news agency Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections of online gaming companies to ensure time limits were put in place. The regulator will also step up measures to punish gaming firms that violate the rules and has increased penalties given after inspections, noting that more than 10,000 gaming titles were reviewed last year. It noted minors could still use their parents' accounts to bypass the restrictions and said parents and schools also need to step up supervision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Pennsylvania governor issues mask mandate for schools, child care facilities",1827,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Tuesday issued a mask mandate for all K-12 school and child care facilities to protect against the spread of COVID-19, three weeks after the Democrat said he would leave the decision to individual districts. The order, which goes into effect Sept. 7, comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the highly-contagious Delta variant of the virus. Since July, Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 case load has increased from less than 300 a day to more than 3,000 a day, according to the state's health department. “With case counts increasing, the situation has reached the point that we need to take this action to protect our children, teachers and staff. The science is clear,"" the state's acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said in a statement. The decision comes as millions of public education students head back to schools across the United States. School districts, state education agencies and governors across the nation are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements. In South Carolina, for example, the state's supreme court heard arguments on Tuesday in two cases involving mask mandates in city of Columbia schools. The order in Pennsylvania requires students, teachers and staff to wear masks in all public and private K-12 schools. The order also applies to child care providers and early learning programs. The order does not apply to school sports or outdoor activities. In early August, Wolf said he intended to leave the decision to require masks in schools up to individual districts. ""Unfortunately, an aggressive nationwide campaign is spreading misinformation about mask-wearing and pressuring and intimidating school districts to reject mask policies that will keep kids safe and in school,"" he said.

'Most stressful time of my career': Law deans reflect on pandemic,3501,"(Reuters) - Law school deans have lost plenty of sleep during the pandemic, according to a newly published survey in which top law school administrators reported high levels of COVID-related stress. It wasn’t just the health of their law school communities that kept deans up at night during the early months of the pandemic. They were also worried about potential budget shortfalls and the learning experience for students who abruptly traded in-person courses for online classes, according to the survey, which was published last week. It was conducted in November by University of Toledo Law Dean Benjamin Barros and 2021 Toledo law graduate Cameron Morrissey, and generated responses from 51 deans – or about a quarter of those who lead American Bar Association-accredited law schools. “I’ve had some stressful days as a dean,” Barros said in an interview with Reuters. “But that April, May, June period early in the pandemic was hands down the most stressful time of my career.” In addition to quickly figuring out how to move his school online, Barros said he was bracing for a 20% budget cut from the state because Ohio officials were unsure of how the pandemic would impact tax revenue. The state funding reduction ended up being less than anticipated, but the scramble to quickly identify costs savings was unnerving, he said. Barros surveyed his colleagues in November of 2020, in part to create a historical record of how the pandemic was felt across legal education. The resulting article, titled, “A Survey of Law School Deans On the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” appears in the latest edition of the University of Toledo Law Review. The survey looks to be the first to document that law deans at some public schools felt political pressure to hold classes in-person. Only eight of the responding deans indicated a strong degree of political pressure to teach in person, the survey found, but all eight were from public law schools. The survey results were anonymous and did not disclose where the deans who reported political pressure were located. All but four responding deans said their schools went remote in the spring of 2020. For the fall 2020 semester, 63% of courses were given online, on average. The deans generally reported low rates of COVID-19 within their law school communities. When asked what percentage of students and staff had tested positive for the virus in the first nine months of the pandemic, the average response was 3% among students and less than 2% among staff and faculty. But the mental well-being of both students and faculty emerged as a major source of concern among the deans, the survey found. On a scale of 0 to 7, all but six rated the “impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental wellbeing of your students” as a four or higher. The results were similar when asked about the mental wellness of faculty and staff. When asked to report the extent to which the pandemic had negatively impacted their own stress level, all but 10 of the responding deans responded with a four or higher. Barros noted that he conducted the survey at a time when vaccines were about to become widely available and the end of the pandemic seemed to be on the horizon. But the rise of the Delta variant has meant deans are still grappling with COVID-19. “All of us were hoping we’d be past this right now, and we aren’t,” he said.

Eagle escapes Par's patent claims over proposed Vasostrict generic,3870,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc's proposed generic of Endo International subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical Inc's best-selling drug doesn't infringe Par's patents, a Delaware federal court ruled Tuesday. Eagle's generic doesn't infringe patents related to Par's Vasostrict, which is used to treat shock in patients whose blood vessels suddenly relax, because it has a lower pH than the drug composition covered by Par's patents, U.S. District Judge Colm Connolly said following a three-day bench trial in July. Eagle's CEO Scott Tarriff said in an email that the company was ""very pleased"" with the decision, which is ""a significant step towards bringing our vasopressin product to the market."" Tarriff said he anticipated that Eagle would have final approval for the generic in time to launch it this year. Eagle's attorneys David Moore and Bindu Palapura of Potter Anderson & Corroon and Bryan Hales and Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Endo or Par's attorneys Brian Farnan of Farnan and Martin Black of Dechert. Dublin-based Endo sold over $785 million worth of Vasostrict last fiscal year, making it the company's highest-selling drug, according to a company report. Par sued Eagle in 2018 after the Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based company filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a generic version of Vasostrict, alleging the generic would infringe its patents related to the drug. Eagle said it didn't infringe because its formulation of the drug's active ingredient, vasopressin, has a pH value below the range covered by Par's patents. During a study, a batch of Eagle's generic had a pH level in Par's patented range, but Connolly said Eagle altered its manufacturing process to ""assure tighter control of pH"" after the test result, and that none of the test results for batches created after this change approached the patented pH range. Par said the pH of Eagle's generic tends to drift upwards and that its proposal outlines a drug that is just below the patented range, making it likely to infringe. ""But the data do not establish that Eagle's ANDA product has the 'drift problem' Par claims,"" Connolly said in his Tuesday ruling. The measurements for Eagle's product didn't show a ""steady and inevitable creep"" toward higher pH values, but ""minor fluctuations"" with no ""discernible trend,"" Connolly said. Connolly also said Par mischaracterized the high end of Eagle's proposed pH range. Eagle asserted in its ANDA that its drug would have a lower pH value than outlined in Par's patents ""through the entirety of the products' shelf lives,"" and it must comply with its ANDA specifications to receive FDA approval, the court said. ""Accordingly, the ANDA product Eagle is asking the FDA to approve cannot have"" a pH in Par's patented range, and ""therefore a judgment of noninfringement must necessarily ensue,"" Connolly said. Par's infringement case against Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc, which proposed its own generic of Vasostrict and was also part of the July bench trial, is still pending. The case is Par Pharmaceutical Inc v. Eagle Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, No. 1:18-cv-00823 For Par: Brian Farnan of Farnan; and Martin Black of Dechert For Eagle: David Moore and Bindu Palapura of Potter Anderson & Corroon; and Bryan Hales and Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis Blake Brittain reports on intellectual property law, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.

"Russian Olympic medallists made to quarantine before meeting Putin, athlete says",1484,"MOSCOW, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Russian Olympic medallists are being made to quarantine for a week after returning from the Tokyo Games so that they can meet President Vladimir Putin, one of the team's athletes said on Tuesday. Russians won 71 medals, including 20 golds, at the Olympics, a result feted as a victory at home despite the country competing without its flag and anthem because of doping sanctions. Putin, 68, had two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, one in March and one in April, according to the Kremlin, but Moscow has continued to take pandemic precautions with regards to his health. Before being vaccinated, Putin spent much of the pandemic running the country from his residence rather than the Kremlin, chairing video conference meetings instead of face-to-face encounters. People who meet him in person have reported being required to quarantine. ""All Olympic champions and medallists have a meeting with the president when they return home,"" gymnast Angelina Melnikova, who won gold in the women's team event and bronze in the all-around and floor exercice, wrote in her Instagram stories. ""The meeting is planned for September 10, and because of COVID, which we are all fed up with, we have to be in quarantine for seven days.""

(Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc has hired a lobbying team at Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz to represent it on matters including antitrust and tech supply chain issues, according to a new disclosure from the Washington, D.C.-based law firm. Baker Donelson's U.S. advocacy disclosure on Aug. 27 did not reveal the scope of the antitrust lobbying, and a spokesperson for the firm and two lobbyists on the registration, Nathan Daschle and Joe Hack, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Baker Donelson is advocating for Broadcom through its public policy advisory firm, The Daschle Group, where Daschle is president and chief operating officer and Hack is a vice president. Lobbying on antitrust and privacy matters has soared in recent years amid a new bipartisan push to confront the power and influence of major U.S. technology companies. In June, the Biden White House announced a new executive order directing federal agencies to consider the competition implications of their decisions. A representative from Broadcom did not return a message seeking comment about Baker Donelson's lobbying, which began in late July, according to the disclosure. The Washington, D.C.-based government affairs firm Invariant also disclosed it was lobbying for Broadcom on antitrust and other matters. Eric Rosen, Invariant's head of tech, judiciary and commerce matters, and a lobbyist for Broadcom, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Last month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced Broadcom had agreed to settle an antitrust complaint alleging the company abused its monopoly power through restrictive contract terms and threats of retaliation against ""disloyal"" customers. The chip products at issue in the agency's complaint were used in video set-top boxes and broadband internet access devices, the FTC said. The company said in a statement then that ""while we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC's characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us."" The statement also said ""the FTC investigation into our other businesses has been closed without action."" Lawyers from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Latham & Watkins represented Broadcom in the FTC settlement. The public comment window on the settlement runs until Sept. 8.

"South Africa detects new coronavirus variant, still studying its mutations",2785,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - South African scientists have detected a new coronavirus variant with multiple mutations but are yet to establish whether it is more contagious or able to overcome the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection. The new variant, known as C.1.2, was first detected in May and has now spread to most South African provinces and to seven other countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania, according to research which is yet to be peer-reviewed. It contains many mutations associated in other variants with increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, but they occur in a different mix and scientists are not yet sure how they affect the behaviour of the virus. Laboratory tests are underway to establish how well the variant is neutralised by antibodies. South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, one of only four labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Beta is believed to spread more easily than the original version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and there is evidence vaccines work less well against it, leading some countries to restrict travel to and from South Africa. PANDEMIC 'FAR FROM OVER' Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist and one of the authors of the research on C.1.2, said its emergence tells us ""this pandemic is far from over and that this virus is still exploring ways to potentially get better at infecting us"". People queue outside a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination centre as the country opens vaccinations for everyone 18 years old and above in Cape Town, South Africa, August 20, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo He said people should not be overly alarmed at this stage and that variants with more mutations were bound to emerge further into the pandemic. Genomic sequencing data from South Africa show the C.1.2 variant was still nowhere near displacing the dominant Delta variant in July, the latest month for which a large number of samples was available. In July C.1.2 accounted for 3% of samples versus 1% in June, whereas Delta accounted for 67% in June and 89% in July. Delta is the fastest and fittest variant the world has encountered, and it is upending assumptions about COVID-19 even as nations loosen restrictions and reopen their economies. read more Lessells said C.1.2 may have more immune evasion properties than Delta, based on its pattern of mutations, and that the findings had been flagged to the WHO.

Egypt ramps up local vaccine production with eye on exports,2367,"CAIRO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Egypt is ramping up production of the Sinovac coronavirus vaccine as it aims to become a hub for vaccine exports to Africa and protect its own population of more than 100 million from a fourth wave of infections. The government is preparing new facilities that it says could produce several million vaccine doses daily, and is also in talks with an unspecified European vaccine producer. ""We are currently in discussions with other companies because it is important to us that we diversify our sources, and hopefully soon we will announce our partnership with a European company,"" said Dr Heba Wali, president of the state-run Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA). Wali, speaking at VACSERA's headquarters, said one million doses of the VACSERA-Sinovac jab had already been distributed within Egypt. In recent months, Egypt has also received shipments of vaccines made by Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinovac and Johnson & Johnson. Nearly 7.5 million people in Egypt had received at least one dose of a vaccine, Health Minister Hala Zayed said last week as she announced a push to accelerate jabs. A fourth wave of COVID-19 infections is expected to peak in late September after a lull in infections, according to Zayed. A new VACSERA facility outside Cairo aims to begin production in November and have a capacity of 1 billion vaccines per year. ""We aim to not only be self-sufficient regarding the vaccine, but we hope to export it to our brothers in African countries and the entire region,"" Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in a statement on Monday. Wali said that Egypt's Chinese partners had overseen the local production lines, and she dismissed doubts about the Sinovac shot's efficacy, citing its approval by the World Health Organization. ""However, with the appearance of new strains of the virus, companies always study their vaccines and their effectiveness with these new strains, and if any company confirms that it is ineffective, they will (further) develop their vaccine."" On Tuesday, Egypt reported 263 new cases, bringing its total to 288,162, including 16,727 deaths. Officials and experts say the real number is far higher but not reflected in government figures because of low testing rates and the exclusion of private lab results.

Three hours a week: Play time's over for China's young video gamers,4407,"SHANGHAI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - China has forbidden under-18s from playing video games for more than three hours a week, a stringent social intervention that it said was needed to pull the plug on a growing addiction to what it once described as ""spiritual opium"". The new rules, published on Monday, are part of a major shift by Beijing to strengthen control over its society and key sectors of its economy, including tech, education and property, after years of runaway growth. The restrictions, which apply to any devices including phones, are a body blow to a global gaming industry that caters to tens of millions of young players in the world's most lucrative market. They limit under-18s to playing for one hour a day - 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. - on only Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, according to the Xinhua state news agency. They can also play for an hour, at the same time, on public holidays. The rules from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) regulator coincide with a broader clampdown by Beijing against China's tech giants, such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and Tencent Holdings (0700.HK).

The crackdown reverberated around the world. Shares in Amsterdam-listed tech investment company Prosus (PRX.AS), which holds a 29% stake in Chinese social media and video games group Tencent, were down 1.45%, while European online video gaming stocks Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) and Embracer Group (EMBRACb.ST) each fell over 2%. Shares of Chinese gaming stocks slid in pre-market trading in the United States with NetEase falling over 6% and mobile game publisher Bilibili dropping 3%. About 62.5% of Chinese minors often play games online, and 13.2% of underage mobile game users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on working days, according to state media. Gaming companies have been on edge in recent weeks as state media criticised gaming addiction among young people, signalling a regulatory crackdown. A state media outlet described online games as ""spiritual opium"" this month and cited Tencent's ""Honor of Kings"" in an article that called for more curbs on the industry, battering shares in the world's largest gaming firm by revenue. Tencent later announced new measures to reduce the time and money children spend on games, starting with Honor of Kings. Its president also said it was working with regulators to explore ways in which the total amount of time minors spent on gaming could be capped across all titles in the industry. The NPPA regulator told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems. It also said that parents and teachers played key roles in curbing gaming addiction. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Walgreens to raise minimum hourly wage to $15 for all staff from October,1734,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said on Tuesday it would raise the minimum wage of all its staff to $15 an hour from October, as the drugstore chain joins several U.S. firms in trying to retain and lure more people back to work.

The causation problem in robotically assisted surgical device litigation,9239,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 31, 2021 - Robotically assisted surgical devices (RASD) are one type of computer-assisted surgical systems. RASD have become popularized in recent years and are now commonly used by health practitioners to perform a variety of different surgical procedures. The precision and minimal invasiveness offered by these devices make them attractive to health practitioners and patients, but like all products, RASDs are not flawless and generally not regulated by any singular government agency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared RASDs for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures in general surgery, cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, thoracic and urologic. The FDA does not supervise or credential physician training, however. That role is assumed by manufacturers, physicians, and health care facilities. Some professional societies and specialty board certification organizations have developed and support training for RASD specialty physicians. Specialty boards also maintain RASD specialty physician certification status. RASDs have been the subject of increased litigation due to alleged defects in the manufacturing or design, as well as the failure by health care facilities and practitioners to properly maintain and operate the devices. A variety of causes of action are available to plaintiffs in these matters, including strict products liability, negligence, corporate negligence, medical malpractice, and breach of warranty. A common element of each cause of action applicable to RASD litigation is causation, and a trend in RASD litigation is the difficulty plaintiffs experience in establishing causation. Understanding the various causes of action applicable to RASD litigation and the nature of the causation problem is critical to parties prosecuting and defending these matters. The element of causation, linking the wrongdoing of a defendant to the harm incurred by the plaintiff, is an essential element to every RASD cause of action. In fact, the causation element is the most frequently contested issue at the summary judgment stage in RASD case law. Causation, in broad terms, refers to two critical and related components: actual cause and proximate cause. Actual cause is the simpler concept that merely connects the injury to the cause-in-fact; e.g., a scalpel nicked tissue, causing injury. Proximate causation is the more difficult aspect to establish, as it is the primary cause of injury: e.g., what caused the scalpel to nick the tissue? To establish causation, a plaintiff generally must prove that the defect, design, warning, maintenance or use of the robotic device proximately caused the injury. The failure of a plaintiff to establish causation is fatal to their cause of action. Although causation is generally held to be a question of fact appropriate for a jury to determine, defendants have effectively established the lack of causation as grounds for summary judgment. Certain key issues have been addressed by courts in the struggle of litigants to establish or eliminate the causation element. Causation involving complex medical devices has been most typically established through the use of expert witnesses. Where a jury is expected to consider complex medical or scientific issues beyond the scope of the common person's knowledge, expert testimony is favored and the lack of expert testimony can be fatal to a plaintiff's causation requirement. In addition to it being proffered at the trial stage, plaintiffs often present expert testimony at the summary judgment stage to overcome defensive arguments regarding the lack of causation. In Mraceck v. Bryn Mawr Hosp., a 2010 case in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the plaintiff filed a strict products liability lawsuit arising from an RASD prostatectomy surgery. Plaintiff alleged the RASD malfunctioned and displayed an ""error"" screen, which the surgery team was unable to resolve. The surgeon opted to finish surgery without the RASD. Shortly after surgery, plaintiff began experiencing symptoms, which he attributed to the malfunction of the RASD. The device manufacturer defendant sought summary judgment, arguing the plaintiff failed to submit expert testimony and could not establish the RASD caused his injuries. Summary judgment was granted and affirmed at the appellate level because the plaintiff had not created an issue of fact for a jury to resolve regarding the causal link between his injuries and the RASD. While expert testimony may not be required in all RASD cases, plaintiffs opting to proceed without expert testimony are ideal summary judgment targets for defendants on the causation issue. Because it is difficult to prove a defect and causation in RASD cases, plaintiffs try to employ the res ipsa loquitur theory. Under res ipsa loquitur, an inference that the defendant was negligent is created if the plaintiff can establish: (1) the product was under the exclusive control of the defendant; (2) the plaintiff did not contribute to the incident; and (3) the incident resulting in the injury does not normally occur without negligence on the part of the party in control of the product. Res ipsa loquitur has been disfavored in RASD cases. In Brown v. Griffin, a 2016 Kentucky Court of Appeals case, the appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of a surgeon in a medical malpractice action arising from an RASD hysterectomy. The plaintiff argued res ipsa loquitur should apply because the surgeon testified about his relative inexperience with the RASD, from which she argued a jury could infer the surgeon's ""newness"" in the use of RASD contributed to her injury. The trial and appellate courts rejected this argument, holding jurors do not have general knowledge sufficient to understand the complex nature of RASD surgeries, complications, and mechanisms by which injury or complications occur. A causation issue arises in these cases where certain aspects of a procedure were performed using an RASD and while certain aspects were performed without using an RASD. The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the RASD component of surgery caused injury as opposed to the non-RASD aspect. In Mohler v. St. Luke's Medical Center, LP, a 2008 Arizona Court of Appeals case, the plaintiff underwent a laparoscopic surgery at the defendant's medical center. The attending surgeon performed part of the surgery using a RASD and the other part without. Plaintiff's small intestine was perforated during surgery. In his lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged the medical center negligently failed to ensure the surgeon was properly credentialed to operate the RASD, causing his injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment, finding the plaintiff was unable to establish the failure to ensure credentialing or even the uses of RASD caused his injuries. The Court of Appeals disagreed and found that issues of fact existed for a jury to decide; namely, whether the perforation occurred during the use of the RASD. While RASDs are becoming more common in the practice of health care, it cannot be said that layperson knowledge of these devices has increased proportionally. Because the use of these devices remains heavily specialized, courts will continue to defer to expert testimony and strict causation requirements without allowing causation inferences or more relaxed proof requirements available in more commonplace cases. Counsel on both sides of litigation should expect causation to continue to be the primary point of contention in RASD cases. Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Greek PM sacks public order minister after wildfires,2212,"ATHENS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis replaced his public order and tourism ministers on Tuesday and created a new civil protection post following sharp criticism of the government's response to a spate of summer wildfires. More than a quarter of a million hectares of pine forests were destroyed in August by blazes that burned for several days across Greece, with flames reaching the outskirts of Athens. Homes and businesses were destroyed, two people were killed and thousands were forced to evacuate. read more Mitsotakis, whose conservative government took office in July 2019, has apologised publicly for delays and breakdowns in the official response to the fires, and promised to rectify mistakes. read more On Tuesday, he replaced Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis with Takis Theodorikakos, a political analyst and former interior minister. He switched Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias, who last year oversaw Greece's successful containment of the first wave of COVID-19 infections, to the country's key tourism post in place of Harry Theoharis. Mitsotakis' spokesperson also announced the creation of a civil protection ministry to be headed by Evangelos Apostolakis, a retired admiral and former defence minister. But Apostolakis, who served as defence minister under a previous Syriza leftist government, did not accept the post on grounds that an interparty consensus regarding his appointment had not been reached. The prime minister's office confirmed the rejection by Apostolakis and plans to look for a replacement for the post. The prime minister set up a natural disaster recovery committee in mid-August in the wildfires' aftermath. The reshuffle, in which Finance Minister Christos Staikouras and Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias were retained in their posts, comes less than two weeks before Mitsotakis is due to outline his 2022 economic policy in a keynote speech in Thessaloniki.

Yanomami shaman sees tough times ahead for Brazil's indigenous,4104,"BRASILIA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shaman Davi Kopenawa, chief of the Yanomami people who live on Brazil's largest indigenous reservation, fears a pending Supreme Court decision on native land claims could worsen an onslaught of aggressive mining encouraged by President Jair Bolsonaro. ""The machines will scrape off the skin of Mother Earth and wound it,"" he told Reuters in Brasilia, where thousands of indigenous protesters gathered last week to protest ahead of the landmark ruling. Kopenawa said illegal gold miners, emboldened by Bolsonaro's criticism of native land protections, are invading his people's ancestral lands on the border with Venezuela in growing numbers and using automatic weapons to intimidate the Yanomami. In the past, wildcat miners brought influenza and malaria that killed hundreds of Yanomami, but today the danger is the spread of COVID-19 that has taken nine of their people so far. On Wednesday, the top court will discuss an appeal by the Xokleng tribe against a position adopted by Brazilian governments since 2016 that claims to indigenous land can only be recognized if tribes were living there when the constitution was ratified in 1988. The Xokleng were expelled from much of their land in 1952. read more The ruling will affect 230 pending land claims, many of which offer a bulwark against deforestation in the Amazon. A defeat in court for the indigenous people would set a precedent for the rollback of native rights advocated by Bolsonaro and backed by powerful farming interests. ""Our territory was registered and signed by the federal government in 1992, but they want to reduce its size because Bolsonaro says it is too large for so few people,"" the 66-year-old shaman said in an interview. Some 29,000 Yanomami live in 360 villages spaced out over the 96,650 square kilometers (24 million acres) of reservation, about the size of Portugal, stretching from northern Brazilian savannah into the Amazon rainforest. An internationally renowned spokesman for the Yanomami, Kopenawa is the author of ""The Falling Sky,"" a poetic account of his initiation as a shaman, his first encounters with outsiders and an appeal to save his people's culture and the rainforest. WOUNDS TO THE EARTH Satellite and aerial images show the dramatic advance of polluted gold mining ponds in deforested areas along the Uraricoera and Mucajai rivers in the reservation since Bolsonaro was elected in 2018. Bolsonaro has often said indigenous people make up less than 1% of Brazilians and live on more than 13% of the country's territory, sitting on undeveloped mineral riches. Critics say his efforts to legalize mining on protected lands have encouraged the advance of illegal miners, who have swarmed the Yanomami reservation in motorboats and prop planes landing on clandestine airstrips in the forest. A wave of invasions in the 1980s brought miners offering gifts of machetes, hammocks, clothes, soap and even guns and liquor to befriend the Yanomami, Kopenawa said. They chased the women and spread killer illnesses such as influenza and malaria. Now, after international criticism that Brazil's indigenous people had been left to the mercy of the coronavirus, the government has began to vaccinate communities and, according to the Health Ministry, 84% of the target Yanomami population have had a first vaccine dose. An equally dangerous enemy is the mercury used by miners to separate gold from the earth. The toxic liquid metal is polluting rivers and poisoning the fish that the Yanomami and other indigenous people rely on to eat. read more ""The mercury wounds the Earth for years and years, and there is no medicine to cure the Earth,"" said Kopenawa, who complains the government has done little to evict the miners despite a Supreme Court order to protect indigenous people. ""They want to eliminate us and take our land. We have to keep fighting to save it for future generations so they can continue our customs, our language, our songs,"" he said.

Putin approves pre-election payments to soldiers and police in Russia,1889,"MOSCOW, Aug 31 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved one-off payments to law enforcement and military officials ahead of a parliamentary election next month, a move critics said was designed to encourage them to vote for the ruling party. The payments, worth 15,000 roubles ($200) each, will be made in September to fire fighters, police officers, prosecutors and soldiers, among others, according to two decrees signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website on Tuesday. The decrees said the payments were designed to protect the social needs of those receiving them. The Kremlin leader last month pledged similar payments to pensioners, many of whom have been affected by rising food rises and inflation of 6.5%, well above the central bank's 4% target. Kirill Rogov, a political expert who is sometimes critical of the Kremlin, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station that the payments amounted to targeted bribes of key voter groups upon whom Putin relies to remain in power. The Kremlin denies the payments are in any way connected with the elections. Putin, 68, has been in power as either president or prime minister since 1999. He helped found the ruling United Russia party which is expected to retain its dominance at next month's elections despite a slump in its rating fuelled by years of stagnating or falling real incomes. At the party's congress in June, Putin pledged additional spending on infrastructure, education and health projects designed to boost living standards. read more Putin earlier this year signed legislation barring members of groups deemed extremist, including allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, from running for office. The move, critics say, was designed to stamp out opposition to United Russia. The Kremlin denies the crackdown is political.

Geronimo the alpaca euthanised in Britain despite public outcry,1869,"LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - An eight-year-old alpaca named Geronimo, who was at the centre of a legal row with the British government and whose plight triggered a nationwide campaignto keep him alive, has been killed after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis. Video footage showed veterinary staff in blue overalls, masks, and goggles, backed by police officers, arrive at a farm in western England where the animal lived, and lead him away. The order to kill the alpaca led to pleas from owner Helen Macdonald for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie to show mercy, prompting some celebrities to demand they swerve away from what they cast as a public relations disaster. Protesters in recent weeks had shown up at Macdonald's farm to guard him from executioners after the government ordered him to be put down. More than 140,000 people had signed a petition calling for the creature to be saved. ""The infected animal was moved from the premises and euthanised by staff from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) as a necessary measure to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis,"" the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement. Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other mammal species. It can spread to humans through the ingestion of unpasteurised milk. Macdonald, a veterinary nurse, said the alpaca was negative when he was brought in from New Zealand and believes the government’s diagnosis is the result of a false positive. She has spent thousands of pounds on a failed court battle to save the animal. A spokesman for the prime minister said it is highly distressing for someone to lose an animal. ""Our sympathies are with Ms Macdonald and others that are affected by this terrible disease,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
France aims to give third COVID-19 vaccine shot to 18 million by early 2022,1910,"PARIS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - France aims to have administered a third shot of a COVID-19 vaccine to some 18 million people by early 2022, a health ministry official said on Tuesday. Last week, France's top health advisory body (HAS) recommended a booster shot for those aged 65 and over and for those with existing medical conditions that put them at risk. read more ""Those eligible for a booster shot have been able to make appointments since Monday this week. We see this as a genuine health requirement to extend protection, as some studies demonstrate,"" the official said. ""We are talking of around 18 million people who are currently eligible for a third dose. We hope to see some 12.4 million get this booster shot by year-end and the rest at the beginning of next year."" Government data shows nearly 72% of the total French population had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Aug 30. A little more than 65% had received two doses or one dose after having been diagnosed with COVID-19. There is no consensus among scientists and agencies on whether a third dose is necessary. Last week, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus, said data on third shots was inconclusive. He had previously said they should be halted and that authorities should focus on delivering doses to poorer nations. However, WHO Europe head Hans Kluge appeared to be more positive than the U.N. health body's past assessments on Monday, saying booster shots were a way to keep the most vulnerable safe. read more A fourth wave of COVID-19 infections is receding in France but the government is taking a cautious stance as schools prepare to reopen after the summer vacation.

Hong Kong to further relax law to fix doctor shortfall,1545,"HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong will further relax a contentious plan to let non-local doctors practise in the city in order to tackle a shortfall of medical staff in the public sector, the city's Health Secretary said on Tuesday. Sophia Chan, speaking at a press conference, said the government was proposing to allow foreign doctors with specialist qualifications to work in the city via a scheme which allows them to skip a decades-old compulsory exam. The scheme, which was announced at the start of this year, had initially been limited to overseas-trained Hong Kong residents and even then had sparked a backlash amongst many in the local medical sector who believed it would lower health care standards in the Asian financial hub. Some see the legislation as a first step in replacing local doctors with those from mainland China, where there are concerns over health and safety standards, more than a dozen medical workers told Reuters in May. read more Chan dismissed concerns that the law would lead to lower standards. ""We are very careful about ensuring the quality of these doctors,"" she said. Hong Kong has an acute doctor shortage with the per capita ratio two doctors per 1,000 people, far lower than other economies, the government said. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has urged medical workers to support the bill and sharply criticised medics for ""politicising"" government policies, including its response to COVID-19 and the use of the Chinese-made vaccine Sinovac.

Chinese teens vent at new gaming limits as investors weigh impact on industry,3526,"SHANGHAI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Young Chinese gamers took to social media to express their outrage at new rules that limit their gaming time to just three hours per week, while investors fretted about the long-term impact on the industry. Authorities argue the restrictions are necessary to stop growing gaming addiction and the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, said the government had to be ""ruthless"" as online games impair normal study life and the physical and mental health of teens. The curbs are part of Beijing's efforts to promote the primacy of socialism and strengthen controls over society it now views as having become too lax after years of laissez-faire growth for the tech sector and other industries. Young gamers were, however, angry. ""This group of grandfathers and uncles who make these rules and regulations, have you ever played games? Do you understand that the best age for e-sports players is in their teens?"" said one comment on China's Twitter-like Weibo. ""Sexual consent at 14, at 16 you can go out to work but you have to be 18 to play games. This is really a joke."" While the hit to gaming stocks was relatively measured as children do not provide much revenue for gaming companies, analysts noted that the implications for the long-term growth of the industry were much more severe. ""The root of the problem here is not the immediate revenue impact,"" said Mio Kato, an analyst who publishes on SmartKarma. ""The problem is that this move destroys the entire habit-forming nature of playing games at an early age."" There was also relief that the regulations did not go further. ""What the industry is really afraid of is if the government stops approving new games like they did in 2018,"" said a Beijing-based private equity investor, referring to a nine-month period when China suspended approvals of new video game titles as part of an overhaul of the regulatory bodies that oversee the sector. ""The new policy is not the worst thing that could have happened,"" said the investor who declined to identified given the sensitivity of the topic. ONUS ON GAMING COMPANIES Shares in Tencent, the world's largest gaming firm by revenue, initially slid but ended up 3%, with analysts noting it had already imposed additional limits on gaming for minors earlier this month. Krafton Inc (259960.KS), a South Korean company that earns fees by providing services for a similar game to its blockbuster ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG) to Tencent, finished 1% lower. Tokyo-listed Nexon (3659.T) and Koei Tecmo (3635.T) joined NetEase (9999.HK), which is traded in United States and Hong Kong, in losing more than 3%. The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. Kids can often circumvent rules that require the use of their real names and national identification numbers when signing into games by using the login details of adult family members. ""This is a family education issue, not a gaming issue,"" said a 17-year-old gamer who wanted to be known only by her surname Luan. But some parents like Li Tong, a hotel manager in Beijing with a 14-year old daughter, were heartened by the new rules. ""My daughter is glued to her phone after dinner every day for one to two hours and it's difficult for me or her mother to stop her,"" he said. ""We told her it's bad for her eyes and it's a waste of her time, but she won't listen."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thai PM faces parliamentary grilling as protests persist,2134,"BANGKOK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers began a censure debate against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Tuesday, as opponents threatened to intensify street protests fueled by frustration at his government's handling of a COVID-19 crisis. The political opposition accuses the former army chief and five of his cabinet ministers, including deputy prime minister and health minister Anutin Charnvirakul, of corruption, economic mismanagement and of bungling the coronavirus response. Prayuth has weathered two previous censure motions and is expected to survive a no confidence vote scheduled for Saturday, owing to his coalition's clear parliamentary majority. But the motion is unlikely to appease the youth-led anti-government groups that sought Prayuth's removal last year and have returned with renewed support from Thais angered by lockdowns, record COVID-19 deaths and a haphazard vaccine rollout. Demonstrators have threatened nationwide protests while the opposition grills Prayuth in parliament. ""Every seven minutes a Thai person died because of the blundered management of the COVID-19 situation,"" opposition leader Sompong Amornwiwat of the Pheu Thai Party said in opening the debate. ""There are economic losses of 8 billion baht ($247.60 million) per day from a lack of management and lockdown measures that have failed."" Prayuth told parliament the government was always working for public interest. ""For those who suffered, I have introduced assisting measures,"" he said. ""The government has increased domestic spending, investment and built healthcare. For you to tell me that I have nothing to show for my performance I'd say look again."" Staunch royalist Prayuth took power in a 2014 military coup and remained prime minister after a 2019 election, making him the longest-serving Thai leader since the end of the Cold War. The protests against him, which are outlawed under coronavirus restrictions, have gathered steam in recent weeks, despite frequent, at times violent clashes with police who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.

"EXCLUSIVE Thailand's elderly lag behind in COVID vaccination drive, data show",5035,"BANGKOK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Just two weeks before her long-awaited vaccine appointment in Bangkok, Anyamanee Puttaraksa's 62-year-old mother became feverish. Three days later, her mother tested positive for COVID-19. Four hours afterward, she died. Alongside Anyamanee's grief is anger at a vaccine rollout that has left the elderly among Thailand's least-vaccinated groups - a contrast to much of the rest of the world, where vulnerable older people have been a priority. ""If she had been vaccinated, her symptoms wouldn't have been so severe,"" Anyamanee said. Government data analysed for the first time by Reuters shows Thailand has fully vaccinated 6.7% of an estimated 10.9 million people 60 and older, compared with 15% of adults aged 18 to 59 and 10.2% of the total population - including children, who are not being vaccinated. Thailand was the only one of 30 countries for which Reuters reviewed data that had a lower percentage of seniors vaccinated than those in younger age groups. Neighbouring Malaysia had fully vaccinated at least 82% of its senior citizens by Aug. 22, according to government data, compared with 45.6% of its total population to date. In Indonesia, only 17% of the elderly have been fully vaccinated, but that is still higher than the 13% for the total population. Chawetsan Namwat, a senior official at the public health ministry's Department of Disease Control, said plans to prioritise the elderly shifted after a major outbreak in Bangkok and added that the relatively low rate of vaccinations in that age group could have led to more deaths among senior citizens. Since April, people aged 60 and over have accounted for at least 62% of deaths in Thailand and about 8.7% of cases. The proportion of elderly deaths has risen, pointing to the possible impact of slow vaccinations. In Indonesia, the elderly account for nearly 12% of cases, but only 47% of deaths. Critics of Thailand's vaccination policy blame it in part for a spike to more than 10,000 deaths in a country where fewer than 100 people died of COVID-19 last year. ""The higher death toll now is a direct result of the failure to prioritise the elderly earlier,"" said Chris Potranandana, co-founder of Zendai, a volunteer group helping the old and the poor access COVID tests and treatment. Chawetsan said that the higher number of deaths in the current outbreak corresponded with higher case numbers and that death rates were only slightly higher in this outbreak. Since April, Thailand's case fatality rate - the ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases - has nearly tripled to 0.96%, from the first two outbreaks' average of 0.33%, data analysed by Reuters show. The rate for the elderly is 7.2%, up from 4% earlier. SHIFTING PRIORITIES Although the government initially announced that the elderly would be a priority group for vaccinations, planning shifted from an age-based priority system to a geographically-based one after an outbreak in Bangkok in April. But younger and working-age groups in the capital ended up being able to access vaccination centres more easily than senior citizens, resulting in lower inoculation rates for the elderly, Chawetsan said. ""We were going to prioritise the elderly but we didn't foresee the massive wave of infections from the Delta variant,"" Chawetsan said. ""When that happened, we had to pool our supply for the risk area with high infection rates and vaccinate all age groups there to curb infections."" Bangkok was allocated a third of Thailand's vaccine supply when the country's mass rollout began in June, despite having only a tenth of the population, official data analysed by Reuters show. Another chunk of vaccines went to the tourist island of Phuket, where a government plan to vaccinate all adults has allowed it to resume limited international tourism. A chaotic start to the vaccine rollout could also have made it harder for the elderly, Potranandana said. Vaccination bookings were invited on a plethora of mobile apps and websites and sometimes cancelled at short notice or set far in the future because of vaccine shortages. ""Access wasn't oriented towards the elderly, who are the least technologically-savvy group,"" he said. Chawetsan said early registration numbers were also low because of vaccine hesitancy among the elderly. The government says it now aims to step up vaccinations for the elderly. Chawetsan said at 70% or more of senior citizens should have at least gotten their first doses by the end of September. A concerted vaccination push in Bangkok now means 97% of senior citizens there have had at least one dose - higher than the 90% for the city's total population - with 7% of the elderly fully vaccinated. Many families complain it came too late. ""They should have vaccinated the elderly right after health and frontline workers,"" said 18-year-old Thippawan Rodinthra, whose 78-year-old grandfather died of COVID-19 last month. ""Between grief and anger, I'm more angry at the government."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

'Perfectionist' Osaka keen to change mindset at US Open and beyond,2038,"NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Defending U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka said on Monday she had put undue pressure on herself by constantly striving for perfection and that going forward she wanted to stop picking holes in her own performances and be happy with trying her best. Osaka, who began her Flushing Meadows title defence with a 6-4 6-1 win over Czech Marie Bouzkova, withdrew from this year's French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to do media duties. The former world number one had said facing the media contributed to the mental health issues she had struggled with for years. She told reporters on Monday she was her own worst critic. ""I tell people that I'm a perfectionist,"" said Osaka, who beat American great Serena Williams to win the first of her four Grand Slam titles at the U.S. Open in 2018. ""I think for me something that's less than perfection, even though it might be something great, is a disappointment. ""I don't really think that's a healthy way of thinking. So something that I really wanted to change,"" she added. The 23-year-old said she wanted to be happy with knowing that she had tried her best at the U.S. Open, and that even if she made mistakes she would learn from them and keep on playing. ""It's not really a tournament thing, it's more like a life thing. Like I hope I can keep this mindset throughout my life going forward,"" she added. Osaka had said on social media at the weekend she intended to celebrate her own achievements more and told reporters on Monday it was important to believe in herself more. ""For me, one of the biggest things is hearing a little kid telling me that I'm their favourite player or I'm a role model. Instinctively the first thought in my mind is like, 'Why?' ""I feel like I have to sort of embrace more the feeling, the honour that they're telling me that, and I should believe more in myself. I feel like if you don't believe in yourself, then other people won't believe in you."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
S. Korean COVID-19 vaccine in late-stage test against AstraZeneca shot,2249,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Bioscience (302440.KS) and Britain's GSK (GSK.L) said on Tuesday the drugmakers had begun a late-stage trial of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate against AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) approved shot, the second study of its kind globally. The AstraZeneca vaccine will take the place of a dummy shot in the trial, which will enrol about 4,000 candidates worldwide. It will test SK's candidate, GBP510, in combination with GSK's vaccine booster after positive early-stage data and a greenlight from South Korea earlier this month. read more Shots from Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O), J&J (JNJ.N) and AstraZeneca have been approved for use in South Korea. However, its inoculation campaign has been dogged by vaccine shortages and shipment delays amid a surging fourth wave of infections. A potential success of the SK vaccine, the country's first domestic candidate, would help cut reliance on Western shots. ""While many countries have made good progress with vaccination, there remains a need for accessible and affordable COVID-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access and to protect people across the world,"" said GSK Chief Global Health Officer, Thomas Breuer. The GSK-SK vaccine, if approved, would be supplied worldwide through the World Health Organization-led COVAX vaccine sharing programme, the companies said, adding that results from the study were expected in the first half next year. Researchers in some countries may not be able give a placebo shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available for ethical reasons. France's Valneva (VLS.PA) is also conducting a late-stage trial against AstraZeneca's shot. The vaccine by SK, also a contract manufacturer for AstraZeneca and Novavax (NVAX.O), is a coronavirus protein-based vaccine, while AstraZeneca's shot uses a modified version of a common-cold virus to deliver immunity-building instructions. British drugmaker GSK, the world's largest vaccine maker by sales, has focused on supplying its adjuvant, or booster, to developers rather than make its own shot in the first leg of the vaccine race. Shares of SK Bioscience closed up about 5% on Tuesday, while GSK was down 0.6% in morning trade. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. Open day one,6365,"NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray went down fighting in the first round of the U.S. Open as third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas triumphed in a near five-hour contest on Monday. As fans returned in numbers to Flushing Meadows for the first time in two years, they were treated to quality tennis at Arthur Ashe Stadium where Tsitsipas won 2-6 7-6(7) 3-6 6-3 6-4, even as Murray fumed over what he saw as the Greek's stalling tactics. ""I lost respect for him,"" Murray said after Tsitsipas took a bathroom break and a medical timeout that broke the Scot's momentum.

Taiwan expects much-anticipated first BioNTech vaccines to arrive soon,2229,"TAIPEI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Around 900,000 doses of BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine are expected to arrive in Taiwan soon, the health minister said on Tuesday, the first delivery of a highly politicised, much-anticipated order whose tortured progress has transfixed the island. Taiwan has blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an order from the German firm earlier this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high profile billionaire founder Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the shot. A $350 million deal for 10 million shots was inked last month, which will be donated to the government for distribution. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung, asked whether the first of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) vaccines would arrive on Wednesday, told reporters he was not able to give an exact timetable, ""but the time mentioned is very close"". ""The number is around 900,000 doses,"" he added. BioNTech, which jointly developed the vaccine with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), declined to comment. Chen said that the arrival of the vaccines had ""great meaning"" for Taiwan, and he would definitely go to the airport to receive them. ""I'll only go when the aircraft arrives,"" he said. Taiwan is getting the shots earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island.

New Zealand COVID-19 cases drop for second day amid lockdowns,2183,"WELLINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - New Zealand's government on Tuesday reported that new COVID-19 cases fell for a second day, down to 49, amid the tight lockdown the country undertook during the latest outbreak this month. Except for a small number of cases in February, New Zealand was mainly coronavirus-free for months, until an outbreak of the Delta variant imported from Australia prompted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. The total number of cases in the outbreak is at 612, with 597 in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland and 15 in the capital Wellington. The declining number of daily cases signals that the social restrictions are reducing the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant, Ardern said in a news conference. ""We have a second day where our numbers have declined. We want the tail of this outbreak to be as short as possible,"" Ardern said. Around 1.7 million Aucklanders will remain in strict level 4 lockdown for another two weeks, while restrictions for the remainder of the country will ease slightly from Wednesday. read more Police placed checkpoints at the outskirts of Auckland to ensure no non-essential movement was allowed into the city. Police also said they had arrested 19 people on Tuesday following anti-lockdown protest around the country. There are now 33 people in hospitals from the latest Delta outbreak, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said, with eight cases in stable condition in intensive care. ""It is sobering to see six cases in the outbreak are under the age of one,"" he said But he added that the public health measures in place were slowing the spread of the virus and cases will continue to decline. Ardern's lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, were credited with reining in COVID-19. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just over a quarter of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Factbox: India prepares for future COVID surge as cases inch up,1836,"NEW DELHI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - India's health infrastructure proved inadequate when COVID-19 cases surged in April and May this year, leading to tens of thousands of deaths as hospitals ran out of oxygen and beds. Infections have started rising again and experts warn of another big jump around October, India's peak festival season. Federal and state governments have said they are more prepared this time around. Here are some numbers shared by the government in parliament as of July or early August: HOSPITAL BEDS * Dedicated hospitals to treat COVID patients have jumped 27 times to 4,389 from April last year. More than 18,000 other centres have been set up mainly for less-serious patients. * Oxygen-supported beds rise eight fold to 416,947. * Total isolation beds jump to 1.8 million from 10,180 in March 2020. * ICU beds rise to 124,598 from 2,168 in March 2020. * Testing capacity jumps to more than 2 million samples a day from 30,000 in April 2020. * The health ministry has supplied about 45,000 ventilators to government hospitals across the country. MEDICAL OXYGEN * The federal government and its ministries are setting up a total of 1,573 PSA oxygen-generation plants, although fewer than 300 plants had started by early August. * Total number of medical oxygen carriers has gone up by 225 to 1,244 since March 2020. PAEDIATRIC WARDS, MEDICINES * Almost all states are setting up special paediatric wards as experts warn unvaccinated children could be vulnerable to any new mutations in the virus. * Some states are also stocking up on anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir. * India is also trying to vaccinate a big majority of its 944 million adults with at least one dose before another COVID wave.

Explainer: What we know about Japan's contaminated Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,3411,"TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japan's COVID-19 vaccination push suffered a blow from widening reports of contamination in supplies of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) vaccine. read more Here are key aspects of the concerns. WHEN WAS IT FIRST REPORTED AND HOW HAS IT WIDENED? The first contamination was reported to Moderna's local distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T), on Aug. 16. That led to the discovery of 39 vials containing foreign material, all from the same lot of 57,000, or about 570,000 doses. On Aug. 26, Japan said that, as a precaution, it had halted use of 1.63 million Moderna doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide. It suspended the use of lot 3004667 that included those vials and two similarly sized lots - 3004734 and 3004956. On Sunday, a vaccination centre in Okinawa prefecture reported finding contaminants from a fourth lot, 3005293. Black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial, with pink substances found in another syringe, the health ministry said. A vaccine centre in Gunma prefecture near Tokyo found a tiny, black substance in a vial from lot 3005236. read more Regional authorities temporarily halted use of the affected lots from Okinawa and Gunma. Later, the health ministry and Takeda said there were no safety concerns and no suspension of use was necessary. The Okinawa cases were probably caused by needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters on Tuesday. read more WHAT ARE THE CONTAMINANTS? The contaminants that triggered suspensions of the first three lots are believed to be metallic particles, public broadcaster NHK said, citing health ministry sources. The ministry has not officially identified the particles, pending an investigation by Takeda, Moderna, and its Spanish contract manufacturing partner Rovi (ROVI.MC). The firms have also yet to comment on what the foreign material is. IS THERE A SAFETY ISSUE? Japan and Moderna have said no safety issues were identified. Two men, aged 38 and 30, died this month within days of receiving their second Moderna doses, the health ministry said on Saturday. Each had a dose from one of the suspended lots, 3004734. The causes of death are being investigated. Each had a fever the day after his second dose and died two days after getting the fever. There has been no evidence of contaminants in their shots, a health ministry official told reporters. By Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving COVID-19 shots from Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech, and 11 after receiving Moderna's. No causality has been established between the injections and deaths, according to the health ministry. About 500,000 people have had shots from the first three suspended batches, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccine push, told reporters on Friday. ARE OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO AFFECTED? Rovi, which packages Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said last week the batch in question was meant for distribution only in Japan. South Korea, which also receives the Moderna vaccines produced from sites in the United States and Spain, said it was not affected. Last week, the European Union drugs regulator said it was investigating the incident but an initial assessment yielded no reason to seek a temporary suspension of production. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Xi’s anti-screen campaign will reshape family time,3638,"HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping wants to reshape Chinese family time at the private sector’s expense. New rules restrict kids to three hours of video games a week to combat smartphone addiction. The financial hit looks manageable for gaming giants like Tencent (0700.HK). But the president wants to drag children away from screens into healthier activities, which will require harsher measures. The latest curbs are strict. Minors under 18 years old are only allowed one hour of game time on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as well as on public holidays. The previous rule allowed them to play an hour and a half on any day, and three hours on holidays. Investors in Hong Kong promptly knocked off some $20 billion from Tencent's market value, roughly 4%, on the news. The sell-off extended to rivals NetEase (9999.HK) and Bilibili (9626.HK). Tencent's smash hit ""Honour of Kings"" is so popular that it has been singled out by state media in a recent column lambasting video-games as ""spiritual opium"". Still, the $575 billion company insists that its systems for verifying identity and limiting game time are adequate. The latest curbs shouldn’t hit the bottom line too hard. In the three months to June, those under 16 accounted for just 2.6% of its domestic gaming revenue. Official distaste for video-games is aggravated by worries about the country's myopia epidemic, a combined side-effect of constant cramming plus screen glare. An estimated 81% of high school students are short-sighted, according to government figures cited by state media in June; Xi is officially concerned, as is the military. The government has already banned for-profit tutoring and is pushing to reduce homework loads. To prevent children from simply shifting to other forms of on-screen entertainment, more online restrictions are likely. Officials are also preparing to reverse decades of systemic under-investment in physical fitness infrastructure like public sports facilities and parks. Parents will feel the change. Workaholics will find it harder to foist off children on tutors or use addictive games and apps as de-facto babysitters, but then the government is trying to reduce overtime too. Over the longer term, this could be healthy for Chinese families, but not so much for businesses. Follow @mak_robyn on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - China's National Press and Publication Administration on Aug. 30 published new rules that allow those under 18 years old to play video games for up to one hour a day, between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

South Korea to begin offering COVID-19 vaccine booster shots in October,2200,"SEOUL, Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Korea plans to begin giving out COVID-19 booster shots from October, joining several countries that have approved such doses amid resurgent infections and concern that vaccine protection wanes over time. The plan will kick in once an October target for full vaccination of 70% of the population is achieved, as authorities aim to boost the rate above 80% with coverage for pregnant women and minors aged between 12 and 17 in the fourth quarter. Initial booster doses will go to those with weakened immune systems or deemed to be at high risk. Others will receive them six months after full vaccination, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said. ""We will start with booster shots for high-risk groups such as the elderly and virus-prevention, medical personnel and gradually expand inoculation in line with expert recommendation and decisions by health authorities,"" President Moon Jae-in told his top aides on Monday. Although the World Health Organization has repeatedly urged a delay in booster doses, arguing that the world's most vulnerable people should be fully vaccinated first, several countries have approved them, citing data on waning protection. Vaccine booster doses will be made widely available to Americans in September, while nations from France and Germany to Israel have decided to offer them to older adults and those with weak immunity. Evidence is growing that protection from COVID-19 vaccines ebbs after six months or more, especially in older people with underlying health conditions. read more In June, South Korea said it planned to secure more mRNA vaccines for booster doses next year for the entire population, on top of its already agreed 106 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N)/(22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O). South Korea has struggled to rein in daily COVID-19 cases as it battles its worst wave of infections since early July. Monday's 1,372 new cases take its tally of infections to 251,421, with a death toll of 2,285. By Monday, at least 56.5% of the population of 52 million had received at least one vaccine dose, while 29.6% had completed the inoculation. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Japan health minister says Okinawa vaccine contaminants likely from needle stick,1691,"TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japan's health minister said on Tuesday it was highly likely that foreign matter found in Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccines in the southern prefecture of Okinawa were caused when needles were stuck into the vials. Some Moderna shots were temporarily halted in Okinawa on Sunday after foreign materials were discovered in vials and syringes. The health ministry said later needles may have been incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. ""Whatever the reason (for the foreign matter) we have heard that there is no safety or other issues,"" health minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters, adding that it was not uncommon for foreign material to enter a vial with other vaccines. ""We will continue to gather information and report back,"" he added. Japan is facing its biggest wave of COVID-19 infections so far during the pandemic, driven by the highly transmissable Delta variant. A race to boost inoculations has been hampered by delays in imported vaccines and the discovery of the contaminants in some Moderna doses that prompted the suspension of three batches last week. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the inoculation campaign, said on Tuesday he wanted to speed up shipments of vaccines to municipalities that had been forced to put a halt reservations due to shortages. The government is considering when and how to give out booster shots that may be needed to maintain immunity against the virus but is focusing for now on completing the first two shots for the public, Kono told reporters.

About 1.6 mln more Americans had health insurance in 2020 - CDC,1654,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - About 1.6 million more Americans had some form of health insurance coverage despite the COVID-19 crisis last year, helped mainly by enrollment growth in government-sponsored health plans, early data from a U.S. government office showed. Estimates based on a household survey by the statistics division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed on Tuesday that a total of 31.6 million, or 9.7% of Americans of all ages, were uninsured last year, down from 33.2 million in 2019. Among Americans of all age groups, the number of people with public health plan coverage grew by 2.1 million to 123.5 million in 2020, while those that had private health insurance grew by 1.9 million to 200.6 million. The United States last year saw a steep rise in job cuts compared to 2019, as companies were forced to layoff employees to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. About 14% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 were uninsured last year, compared to 14.7% in 2019. Hispanic adults were the most likely to lack health insurance coverage, followed by non-Hispanic black adults, the National Center for Health Statistics survey showed. Americans with a family income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level, had the highest percentage of coverage from public health plans such as those of Medicaid, Medicare or children's health insurance program, the survey showed. Officials said the estimates for last year could be impacted by lower response rates, as lockdowns due to the pandemic forced data collection to switch to a telephone-only mode beginning March 2020.

"Louisiana hospitals avoid Ida catastrophe, but staffing challenges loom",2855,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Louisiana hospitals largely escaped catastrophic damage from Hurricane Ida, but the storm created the ""perfect petri dish"" for spread of the coronavirus, officials said on Monday. The weather disaster hit a state where hospitals are crowded with COVID patients, cases of the Delta variant were surging and nurses were in short supply. A handful of smaller hospitals have been forced to evacuate patients, while all major regional hospitals were doing fine for now, Dr. Joseph Kanter, the top medical official in Louisiana, told Reuters by phone. ""Outside of a few, small outlying hospitals, it doesn't appear to be anything catastrophic,"" said Kanter, who worked through the harrowing days of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when some two dozen hospitals in New Orleans had to be evacuated. Warner Thomas, the CEO of Ochsner Health, the largest healthcare provider in the state, said Monday night that two of its smaller hospitals southwest of New Orleans had been evacuated because of damage to roofs and flooding. That affected 65 patients at St. Anne Hospital and Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center, where temporary roofing was being installed. Thomas said Ochsner helped move about 100 patients from Terrebone General Medical Center in Houma, southwest of New Orleans, which is a partner hospital with Ochsner. So far there were no reports of any injuries to patients or staff members because of Hurricane Ida, Thomas said. All Ochsner hospitals in New Orleans suffered roof damage and are working on generator power as electricity remains out, Thomas said, including powering operating rooms where surgeries are still being carried out. The facilities have a 10-day supply of fuel on site, with more on the way already. Nearly all of Louisiana was without power Monday. Many hospitals were using their own water wells while they awaited the restoration of city water services, he said. ""The biggest challenge in the coming days is around our people,"" Thomas said. Doctors, nurses and other staff members have damage to their homes or no power. Ochsner is working on housing them in hotels and elsewhere. Louisiana was already facing a shortage of more than 6,000 nurses before the storm hit, so having more personnel out dealing with damage to their homes would put even more stress on the system, Thomas said. Dr. Rebekah Gee, who until last year was the health secretary for Louisiana and now leads Louisiana State University's healthcare services division, worried about where evacuated patients would go when wards are filled with COVID patients and how the spread of COVID would be impacted. ""This is a perfect petri dish condition for COVID to grow,"" she said. ""People are in close quarters, they aren't going outside, and a lot of congregate sheltering is going to be starting.""

Japan's Moderna vaccine contamination woes widen as regions put holds on shots,3884,"TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine contamination woes in Japan widened after two regions put temporary holds on shots following the discovery of foreign substances in more batches. The disruption to Moderna supplies comes as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 yet, driven by the contagious Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time amid a slow vaccine rollout. The latest reports of vaccine contamination came from Gunma prefecture near Tokyo and the southern prefecture of Okinawa, prompting temporary holds on Sunday on shots from two new Moderna lots. That followed the nationwide suspension of 1.63 million doses last week. A tiny black substance was found in a Moderna vaccine vial in Gunma, an official from the prefecture said, while in Okinawa, black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial, and pink material was found in a different syringe. Japan's health ministry said some of the incidents may have been due to needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. The ministry and Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), which distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan, said there were no safety issues from the Okinawa and Gunma incidents and that there was no need for nationwide suspensions. Gunma and Okinawa can resume using vials from the lots in question as long as they do not contain foreign materials, the ministry told a briefing late on Monday. The contamination cases come on the heels of a government report on Saturday that two people died after receiving Moderna shots that were among lots later suspended. The government had said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was a precaution. The causes of death are being investigated. ""It is unlikely, in my opinion, that contamination of foreign substances led directly to sudden deaths,"" said Takahiro Kinoshita, a physician and vice chair of Cov-Navi, a vaccine information group. ""If the contaminated substances were dangerous enough to cause death for some people, probably many more people would have suffered from some symptoms after the vaccination. ""However, further investigations are definitely needed to evaluate the harm of the particular doses in question."" 'LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE' Japan earlier halted the use of 1.63 million Moderna doses, shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide after Takeda received reports of contaminants in some vials. Some 500,000 people received shots from those supplies, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccine push, has said. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said at the time that the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of Rovi's production lines. Rovi said, in a statement on Sunday, that an investigation was under way in coordination with Moderna, Takeda and the health authorities. Takeda also said, on Monday, that the investigation was ongoing. Rovi shares closed down 13.5% on Monday. Nicholas Rennick, an Australian doctor practicing at the NTT Medical Centre in Tokyo, said the contamination ""is a serious problem"" and there is need to investigate, but given rising COVID-19 cases, Moderna vaccinations should ""continue with appropriate precautions"". Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 44% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries. ""We've got thousands of Delta variant patients around Japan as we speak, spreading the virus, and so many of the population remain unvaccinated and unprotected,"" Rennick said. ""We have to look at the bigger picture."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Florida withholds funds from two school districts over mask mandates,1867,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Florida Department of Education said on Monday it has withheld funds from two school districts that made masks mandatory in classrooms this fall.

Earlier this month, the Florida Board of Education told the two school districts that some of their state funding would be withheld if they failed to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that children wear masks.

'Mission: Impossible' sues insurance company over 7 COVID shutdowns,2374,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. LOS ANGELES, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Production on the new ""Mission: Impossible"" movie was shut down seven times due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday that accuses the film's insurance company of failing to pay out for all but one of the costly stoppages. Filming on the action series starring Tom Cruise was delayed four times in Italy, and three times in the United Kingdom between February 2020 and June 2021, said the lawsuit filed by Paramount Pictures in U.S. federal court in California. The stoppages were caused by positive coronavirus tests among members of the cast or crew, or quarantine or lockdowns imposed in countries where the thriller was being filmed. The lawsuit accuses Indiana-based Federal Insurance Company of breach of contract, saying it has agreed only to pay out $5 million for the first stoppage. Federal Insurance did not immediately return a request for comment. Cruise, who is also a producer on the film, lost his temper on the set of ""Mission: Impossible 7"" in England in December over a breach in COVID protocols, threatening to fire cast and crew members who did not take them seriously. ""Mission: Impossible"" is one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood, with 2018's ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" taking more than $791 million at the worldwide box office. Multiple film and television productions have been disrupted by the pandemic and the cost of testing, consultants and protective equipment has added millionsof dollars to their budgets. Paramount said in the lawsuit that the insurance company argued there was ""no evidence that those cast and crew members could not continue their duties, despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and posing an undeniable risk to other individuals involved with the production."" Paramount did not say how much the shutdowns had cost but said its losses ""far exceeded"" the $5 million that Federal had agreed to pay for the first instance of coronavirus in February 2020. Paramount is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages. The delayed ""Mission: Impossible 7"" is due to be released in May 2022."
U.S. opens investigations into bans on school mask mandates in 5 states,2625,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education is opening civil rights investigations to determine whether five states that have banned schools from requiring masks are discriminating against students with disabilities, the agency said on Monday. The department is targeting Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, all Republican-led states, in its investigations. It said it was concerned that their bans on mandatory masking could leave students with disabilities and underlying health conditions more vulnerable to COVID-19, limiting their access to in-person learning opportunities. ""It's simply unacceptable that state leaders are putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. ""The Department will fight to protect every student's right to access in-person learning safely and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall."" As millions of U.S. public school students head back to the classroom, numerous school districts and state education agencies are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements, especially in the South where the virus is surging. After the announcement of the investigations, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds accused the Biden administration of playing politics. ""I believe and trust in Iowans to make the best health decisions for themselves and their families,"" Reynolds said in a news release. ""Iowa’s democratically elected legislature endorsed that view as well when they passed a law to support a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their own children."" Florida, Texas, Arkansas and Arizona are four other Republican-led states that have banned mandatory masking orders in schools. The Education Department left those states out of its inquiry because court orders or other actions have paused their enforcement, it said in a news release. The department says it is monitoring those states and would take action if local mask-wearing policies are later barred from going into effect. A Florida state judge on Friday ruled that the state had no authority to enforce an order by Governor Ron DeSantis banning public school districts from requiring masks in classrooms. Before the ruling, multiple school districts in the state had defied the governor's order, putting in place mandates that provide exceptions for students with medical conditions. DeSantis has said his office will appeal the court's decision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
BHP considers making COVID vaccinations mandatory at Australian sites,2003,"MELBOURNE, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group (BHP.AX) is mulling whether to make vaccinations for COVID-19 mandatory at its workplaces in Australia as the country's east battles ballooning virus cases. The world's biggest miner on Monday set out measures it was taking to support vaccination in communities where it operates including on-site jabs at its Mt Arthur Coal Mine in New South Wales state that are to begin this week. The state has become the epicentre of Australia's current coronavirus outbreak, having declared a record 1,290 new cases on Monday as the nation struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant. read more Although Australia has used a system of strict lockdowns and quarantine to keep coronavirus infection and death rates lower than in most comparable nations, the Delta variant is now pressuring health services. Residents of its two biggest cities have been on strict lockdown for more than a month. BHP said in a statement that it was actively assessing vaccination as a condition of entry to its workplaces. ""As vaccinations become more accessible to all Australians, we have been encouraging our people to better protect themselves and their families and communities, and we will look for further opportunities to increase access and uptake of vaccinations,"" Edgar Basto, who runs BHP's Minerals Australia business, said. BHP expects to complete its assessment in September, with a policy likely to come into effect in early 2022, once people have had a reasonable opportunity to be fully vaccinated.

Brazil abandons plans to have fans at Argentine qualifier,1267,"SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities have abandoned plans to allow a crowd of 12,000 to watch Sunday’s World Cup qualifier with Argentina due to what the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said was a lack of time to prepare.

U.S. vaccine advisers unanimously favor Pfizer/BioNTech shot after approval,3150,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday unanimously recommended the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration last week granted full approval to the vaccine that was previously available under the agency's emergency use authorization (EUA), which had allowed the shots to be rolled out rapidly to Americans. Health officials hope the formal approval and CDC recommendation will spur more Americans to get vaccinated. With full FDA approval, some companies and states have begun mandating COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination rates remain low in many parts of the United States, contributing to a big surge in hospitalizations due to the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Some panel members said increasing vaccinations before the fall season was critical to getting children back to schools safely. ""Everyone who has anything to do with a child that is not old enough to be vaccinated yet should be vaccinated for the benefit of their children,"" said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, an infectious disease specialist who was part of the panel. Regulators have authorized a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines for those with weak immune systems, and the U.S. government has said it plans to make booster doses available to more Americans in September. The CDC advisers are considering an approach to boosters that would focus on preventing severe disease among those most at risk - residents in long-term care facilities, other older adults and healthcare workers - much like the original vaccine rollout. CDC staff presented available data on the need for boosters and said, at this point it may be difficult to determine whether immunity from prior vaccination is waning over time or if the vaccines are just less able to prevent infection by the highly-transmissible Delta variant. Several panel members expressed concern about the White House announcement of a booster policy starting in September, even before the vaccine advisory panel had seen the evidence or determined that such a campaign was needed. read more Members of the vaccine advisory working group, which is shaping the agency's approach to boosters, stressed that the top U.S. priority remains getting shots to the unvaccinated. Another meeting will be scheduled in mid-September to discuss boosters. At Monday's meeting, the CDC reiterated that the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweigh potential risks associated with the shots. New Zealand on Monday reported its first death linked to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine after a woman suffered myocarditis, a type of inflammation of the heart muscle that is a known rare side effect of the vaccine. read more Health officials there said other factors could have contributed to her death.

Abortion providers ask U.S. Supreme Court to block Texas' six-week ban,2237,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Abortion rights groups filed an emergency request at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which is set to take effect on Wednesday. The groups, including Planned Parenthood and other abortion and women's health providers, told the court that the law would ""immediately and catastrophically reduce abortion access in Texas, barring care for at least 85% of Texas abortion patients"" and would likely force many abortion clinics to close. The groups challenged the law in federal court in Austin in July, contending it violates a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The law, signed on May 19, is unusual in that it gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion past the six-week cutoff. The law is among of a number of ""heartbeat"" abortion bans enacted in Republican-led states. These laws seek to ban the procedure once the rhythmic contracting of fetal cardiac tissue can be detected, often at six weeks - sometimes before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Courts have blocked such bans as a violation of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The state of Mississippi has asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade in a major case the justices agreed to hear over a 2018 law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The justices will hear arguments in their term that begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. The Texas lawsuit seeks to prevent judges, county clerks and other state entities from enforcing the law through citizen lawsuits. The plaintiffs also sued the director of an anti-abortion group that they said has threatened enforcement actions under the new law. A federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss the case, prompting an immediate appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which halted further proceedings in the case. On Sunday, the 5th Circuit denied a request by the abortion providers to block the law pending the appeal. The plaintiffs on Monday asked the Supreme Court to block the Texas law or allow proceedings in the lower court to continue."
Uber proposes industry-wide gig worker benefits model in Canada,2664,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) on Monday proposed a plan for a flexible benefits fund for app-based ride-hail and food delivery drivers in Canada under which all gig industry players would share data on workers' hours and earnings. Under the preliminary proposal outlined in a company blog post, the fund would provide gig workers with cash benefits to put toward a retirement or life insurance plan, or to pay for educational or dental and health benefits not covered by Canada's universal healthcare system. The benefits fund would be enabled by Canada's provincial governments, Uber said in the blog post without providing further details, but managed by ride-hail and delivery companies. The companies would share data on drivers' hours and earnings and pay into the fund proportionally. Workers would qualify for fund benefits if they meet a threshold, which Uber's Monday proposal did not disclose. Uber in a statement said it welcomed discussions with other industry players, adding the benefits fund was part of a recent Ontario government submission. DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) in a statement said it welcomed other stakeholders who wanted to provide workers with benefits while maintaining their flexibility, but did not directly comment on Uber's plan. Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) and Just Eat Takeaway.com's (TKWY.AS) Grubhub did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Uber said it advocates for benefits funds everywhere, but added that labor laws, social safety nets and different cultures meant it would pursue a different approach in every country, with Monday's proposal tailored to Canada. Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer their independent contractor workers. Many labor unions, some lawmakers and the Biden administration have said gig workers should be reclassified as employees. read more The companies have also faced several lawsuits in Canada and the United States alleging worker misclassification. The companies have rejected calls for reclassification, saying surveys showed the majority of their workers do not want to be employees. In recent years, the companies have suggested limited benefit models while maintaining workers' contractor status, including in California where voters approved such a proposal last year. The companies at times have argued apportioning benefits is complicated by the fact that many drivers work for multiple platforms at once. In a March blog post outlining its initial Canadian proposal, Uber advocated for industry-wide reforms that held every company to the same standards.

U.S. health department sets up climate change office,2245,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established an office to address climate change and health equity at the national level, Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Monday. The office aims to protect vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by pollution and climate-driven disasters, including drought and wildfires, he said. ""There is no doubt that America is experiencing climate change, and there is no reason for us to doubt that we must take this on immediately, because it's not just about the climate, it's not just about our environment. It's about our health."" Becerra spoke to reporters as Hurricane Ida knocked out power across Louisiana and Mississippi, killing at least one person and littering roads with downed power lines and debris. President Joe Biden declared major disasters and ordered federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in both states. Becerra declared public health emergencies there. Biden has made tackling the climate crisis domestically and abroad a key part of his agenda. He ordered in May the creation of a comprehensive government-wide climate-risk strategy within 120 days. Establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity is part of that strategy, Becerra said. The office will identify communities disproportionately exposed to climate hazards, address health disparities resulting from climate change, and help with regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare sector. Biden aims to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The health sector accounts for roughly 8.5% of U.S carbon emissions, and the global health sector accounts for around 4.5% of the world's emissions, said Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine. The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250,000 deaths annually. Dr. John Balbus, senior public health adviser to the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is interim director of the new office. Arsenio Mataka, formerly Becerra's environmental adviser when he was California attorney general, joined the department as senior adviser for climate change and health equity."
U.S. urges lawyers to volunteer to fight feared surge of evictions,2219,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday urged attorneys across the legal profession to volunteer their time to assist the crush of tenants expected to be forced out of homes now that a COVID-19 pandemic-related eviction moratorium has ended. The move came four days after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a federal moratorium aimed at keeping people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Democratic President Joe Biden and top members of his party in Congress blasted that decision but have not taken further emergency action to stop what could be a wave of evictions. In a letter addressed to ""members of the legal community,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said eviction filings are expected to spike to roughly double their pre-pandemic levels and that lawyers have an ethical obligation to help the most vulnerable. ""We can do that by doing everything we can to ensure that people have a meaningful opportunity to stay in their homes and that eviction procedures are carried out in a fair and just manner,"" Garland said. Garland's letter encouraged lawyers to volunteer at legal aid providers, or to help tenants apply for emergency rent relief through government programs. Garland said ""the vast majority of tenants need access to legal counsel because far too many evictions result from default judgments in which the tenant never appeared in court."" The nation's top court on Thursday granted a request by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that was to have run until Oct. 3, saying it was up to Congress to act. Over 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives pushed for congressional leaders to take action, writing a letter urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, to revive the national eviction moratorium for the rest of the pandemic. Congress approved $46 billion in rental assistance earlier in the pandemic, but the money has been slow to get to those who need it, with just $3 billion issued through June for rent, utilities and related expenses, according to U.S. Treasury data.

"McDonald's, others consider closing indoor seating amid Delta surge in U.S.",2858,"NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Some U.S. fast-food restaurants are closing indoor seating areas or limiting hours of operation because of the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, according to franchisees. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) had temporarily closed indoor dining at nearly all U.S. locations in early 2020, but it reopened 70% by last month. The global burger chain said on July 28 that it was on track to open nearly 100% by Labor Day - barring any COVID-19 resurgence. But last week, McDonald's instructed its franchisees on steps they should take to re-close their dining rooms in areas where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading, according to internal company materials seen by Reuters. ""We have a much deeper sense of what actions make a difference for the safety of our restaurant teams and crew,"" McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said during a Wednesday meeting, according to the materials. In Wednesday's conference call, McDonald's executives recommended franchisees consider closing indoor seating in counties where COVID cases exceed 250 per 100,000 people on a rolling three-week average. The materials did not specify how many locations have shut indoor seating or could soon do so. One McDonald's franchisee who operates multiple locations told Reuters it had to bar indoor seating at several restaurants. But expected closures are fewer than the number that shuttered in spring of 2020, when the pandemic first hit the United States. ""We’re monitoring the impact of the Delta variant closely and recently convened together with our franchisees to underscore existing safety protocols, reinforce our people first approach and provide updates on the rise in cases in the country,"" McDonald's Corp said in a statement on Friday. Top U.S. health officials said on Friday that U.S. cases of the coronavirus continue to rise amid the fast-spreading Delta variant. Vaccination rates were also higher, they said. Deaths and cases were up 11% and 3% respectively over the past seven days nationwide, with hospitalizations up 6% over the past week to an eight-month high, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. Drive-thru, carry-out and delivery helped fast-food sales rise this year despite shuttered dining rooms. But franchisees told Reuters that sales went up further when indoor seating reopened. PMTD Restaurants had to cut hours in a few of its nearly 40 KFC and Taco Bell (YUM.N) restaurants in Alabama and Georgia because they were short-staffed when several employees became infected with COVID-19, according to Bill Byrd, president of PMTD Restaurants. That impacts Taco Bell locations in particular, because closing at 8 p.m. instead of midnight or later means the restaurants lose late-night customers, who can make up 20% of business, Byrd said.

Biogen offers free Alzheimer's drug as Medicare payment uncertainty remains,4505,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) is providing its controversial and expensive new Alzheimer's drug free of charge for some patients amid slow claim reviews by Medicare, according to sources familiar with the situation, including a doctor treating patients with the drug. The development underscores the division among doctors about whether the $56,000-a-year drug helps patients and how uncertainty about reimbursement from Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for people over age 65, has held back prescriptions and sales. Aduhelm, which is given as a monthly infusion, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June even though one of Biogen's two large clinical trials failed to show a benefit for patients diagnosed with the incurable mind-wasting disease. In order to expedite treatment, Biogen has begun to provide Florida's First Choice Neurology with free-of-charge Aduhelm, according to Dr. Jeffrey Gelblum, a neurologist at the center's Aventura, Florida, operations. ""We have been using the Biogen access program - it is almost like a sample program - to get patients started,"" he told Reuters. Biogen has said it has a number of plans in place to support patient access, but did not give further details. Pharmaceutical companies can provide free medications through patient assistance programs, ""however we have never heard of that for an injectable, infused drug,"" Steven Lucio, vice president at Vizient Inc, which works with about half of U.S. hospitals to buy drugs, said in an email. James Chambers, a researcher at the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said providing free medications is a common strategy drugmakers use to boost patient prescription numbers. HOSPITALS SLOW TO USE A number of hospitals, as well as the Veterans Health Administration, have said there is not enough evidence to justify widespread use of Aduhelm. Several commercial insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest private insurer offering Medicare Advantage coverage to seniors, have said they are waiting for further direction from Medicare before covering the drug. ""Mainly because of the uncertainty around insurance coverage ... most doctors and systems are in a holding pattern,"" said Dr. Anton Porsteinsson, director of the University of Rochester Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program, which is only using Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab, on patients enrolled in clinical trials. A recent survey of 78 neurologists conducted by Morgan Stanley found that half were willing to prescribe Aduhelm, but nearly two-thirds don't think the FDA should have approved the drug. Just eight of the surveyed neurologists had prescribed Aduhelm and six of their Medicare claims had been paid as of early August. Florida's First Choice has so far infused more than 30 patients with Aduhelm, but only the first doses for two patients were billed to Medicare - their second doses, and first doses for the others, were provided at no cost by Biogen, Dr. Gelblum said. He said the clinic has been reimbursed by Medicare for the infusion component of claims, but not for the medication itself, although he expects that to happen within the next couple of weeks. Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people eligible for Aduhelm are covered by Medicare, which recently launched a nine-month process to determine standardized national coverage terms for the drug. For now, the government health plan is processing Aduhelm claims on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the medication itself, costs of administering Aduhelm include diagnostic testing for Alzheimer's and monitoring for side effects such as dangerous brain swelling. Experts say Medicare could seek to lower the therapy's cost to taxpayers by limiting access to the treatment, linking coverage to real-world evidence of patient outcomes, or setting a fixed payment that combines drug reimbursement with other costs related to the treatment. Aduhelm, developed in partnership with Japan's Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T), comes in two vial sizes of 300 milligrams (mg) and 170 mg. Patients are started out on a low dose, which is increased over time to the full dose of 10 mg per kg of a patient's weight. Sales of the drug are forecast to total $81 million this year, $1.3 billion next year and $5.8 billion by 2026, according to Wall Street analysts polled by Refinitiv.

New Zealand reports first death linked to Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,3860,"WELLINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - New Zealand reported its first recorded death linked to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the health ministry said on Monday, after a woman suffered a rare heart muscle inflammation side effect. The report comes as the country battles an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus after nearly six months of being virus free. It followed a review by an independent panel monitoring the safety of the vaccines. ""This is the first case in New Zealand where a death in the days following vaccination has been linked to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine,"" the ministry said in a statement, without giving the woman's age. The vaccine monitoring panel attributed the death to myocarditis, a rare, but known, side effect of the Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine, the ministry added. The board said the myocarditis ""was probably due to vaccination"", according to the ministry. The health ministry said other medical issues at the same time could have influenced the outcome after vaccination. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms. Pfizer said it  recognised there could be rare reports of myocarditis after vaccinations, but such side effects were extremely rare. ""Pfizer takes adverse events that are potentially associated with our vaccine very seriously,"" the company said. ""The benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine continue to greatly outweigh the risk of both COVID-19 infection and vaccine side effects, including myocarditis,"" Pfizer said. A health worker draws a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine from a vial during a vaccination event hosted by Miami - Dade County and Miami Heat, at FTX Arena in Miami, Florida, U.S., August 5, 2021. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo Regulators in the United States, the European Union and the World Health Organization have said that mRNA vaccines from Pfizer with German partner BioNTech and by Moderna (MRNA.O) are associated with rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining around the heart, but that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks. The cases, affecting mainly younger men, tend to be mild and treatable but can lead to serious illness and hospitalization. There have been no U.S. deaths reported for young adults who developed myocarditis after being given the mRNA vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday. Separately, it also said that a total of 2,574 U.S. cases of myocarditis or pericarditis had been reported. More than 330 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been administered in the United States. The risk of myocarditis was 18.5 per million doses given among people aged 18 to 24 after their second Pfizer dose and 20.2 per million for that age group among Moderna second dose recipients. The risk decreases with age, according to the CDC analysis based on its national reporting system. The EU's drug regulator said on July 9 that five people had died due to the heart side effect after receiving either of the two mRNA vaccines in the European Economic Area, all of whom were elderly or had other diseases. More than 200 million mRNA doses have been administered in the region. New Zealand has provisionally approved use of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines, but only the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for rollout to the public. More than 3 million doses have been given so far, mostly to people over 50. New Zealand reported 53 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, taking its tally of infections in the current outbreak to 562, amid a nationwide lockdown enforced this month to limit spread of the Delta variant. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Defendants in U.S. Capitol attack have no attorney after lawyer contracts COVID-19: prosecutors,3344,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors said on Monday that 17 defendants who have been charged in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump have no attorney as John Pierce, the lawyer who has been representing them, is reportedly on a ventilator and unresponsive after contracting COVID-19. Prosecutors said in a filing in Washington, D.C. federal court that although Ryan Marshall, a Pierce Bainbridge associate and chief financial officer of Pierce's National Constitutional Law Union, has been acting in Pierce's stead, he is not a licensed attorney and cannot advise Pierce's clients. Marshall might not be able to obtain a bar license at all due to the criminal charges he is facing in Pennsylvania, prosecutors noted. Marshall was allegedly involved in a scheme to defraud a widow, according to an August 2020 Pittsburgh Tribune-Review report prosecutors cited. Marshall did not respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors made the filing in the case of Casey Cusick, 35, a Florida pastor facing charges relating to the Jan. 6 assault -- including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds -- and said the case was at a standstill from the government's perspective. Cusick, who has pleaded not guilty, could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors said since Marshall is not an attorney, it is not appropriate to communicate with him regarding Pierce's clients. ""Unfortunately, it seems that Mr. Pierce may be hospitalized and unable to communicate, and it is unclear when Mr. Pierce will recover,"" prosecutors said in their filing. It's unclear whether Pierce's firm Pierce Bainbridge is still operating. The firm saw a string of departures last year, which led to it shortening its name from Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht. The phone numbers for Pierce Bainbridge, as well as its only two partners, Pierce and Jim Bainbridge, were no longer in service as of Monday. The government noted there have been conflicting news reports about the exact status of Pierce's health. An NPR reporter on Wednesday said a friend of Pierce's told him Pierce did not have COVID-19 but was hospitalized due to ""dehydration and exhaustion."" That same reporter on Thursday said another source told him Pierce contracted COVID-19 but was not on a ventilator. Prosecutors said they have not had any contact with Pierce since Aug. 23. A prolific Twitter user, Pierce has not tweeted anything since Aug. 20, the government noted. Pierce has previously represented Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal lawyer, and Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old facing homicide charges stemming from protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

"Use of leaded petrol eliminated in 'milestone' for health, environment, U.N. says",2224,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Leaded petrol has been eliminated after the world's last remaining stocks were used up last month, the U.N.'s Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Monday, after heading a 19-year campaign to end use of the poisonous substance that poses major health and environment risks. Algeria, the only country still pumping leaded petrol into vehicles, exhausted its final stocks in July, UNEP said. The agency said the petrol contaminates air, soil and drinking water and can cause heart disease, stroke and cancer. Some studies have shown it harms brain development, especially in children. UNEP worked with governments, businesses and civic groups to eradicate leaded petrol and said ending its use after a century marked a ""huge milestone"". ""Leaded fuel illustrates in a nutshell the kind of mistakes humanity has been making at every level of our societies,"" Inger Anderson, UNEP executive director, told journalists. Those mistakes had driven climate change, pollution and a loss of biodiversity, she said, but the global response to lead in fuel shows that ""humanity can learn from and fix mistakes that we've made"". Lead's toxicity has been recognised since Roman times. It nevertheless began being added to gasoline in the early 1920s to make cars more powerful, and from then on was used in all petrol globally until the 1970s when wealthier countries began phasing it out. But in the early 2000s, 86 nations were still using leaded gasoline. The UNEP-led campaign was formed to help them move away from the fuel including by driving investment and overcoming concerns around prices, Anderson said. UNEP warned, however, that the transport industry remained a driver of climate-warming emissions, and 1.2 billion vehicles were set to hit the road in the coming decades. Antonio Guterres, U.N. Secretary General, said the elimination of leaded gasoline showed what could be achieved via collaboration, and called for similar initiatives towards emissions-free transport and tackling climate change. ""We must now turn the same commitment to... create a world of peace that works with nature, not against it,"" he said in a pre-recorded video. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Class lawyers win reduced fee of $152 million in Sutter case,3818,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A California judge has slashed a requested legal fee award in an antitrust settlement with Sutter Health, approving $152.3 million in compensation for class counsel, after concluding the plaintiffs' lawyers had claimed ""unreasonably high"" hours for their work. Judge Anne-Christine Massullo of San Francisco Superior Court gave final approval to the $575 million settlement as she awarded fees to five law firms that represented plaintiff labor unions and employers, in an order released on Friday. Sutter Health in 2019 first agreed to the settlement resolving claims that anticompetitive practices led to higher healthcare costs in northern California. The awarded legal fee marked about 26% of the settlement, in line with compensation in other class actions, Massullo wrote. Massullo said her award accounted for the ""risk presented by this litigation"" and also ""the novelty and complexity of the issues."" The plaintiffs' lawyers had asked for $172.5 million in fees. A lead lawyer for the class, Richard Grossman of California's Pillsbury & Coleman, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Monday. The firms Farella Braun + Martel; Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll; Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick; and McCracken, Stemerman & Holsberry also represented the plaintiffs. Jones Day partner David Kiernan, a lawyer for Sutter, also did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Monday. Massullo's order awarded $11.5 million in fees to the California attorney general's office, which sued Sutter in 2018. The state's complaint was consolidated with the private litigation, which began in 2014. Massullo said the state attorneys and class lawyers ""demonstrated a high level of skill in providing high quality of representation in this case."" Still, the judge raised concerns about the number of hours -- 194,642 -- that class lawyers claimed in their request for fees. Massullo said the claimed hours compared to ""93.6 years of work, or more than 7 years of work for 13 attorneys."" Declarations from plaintiffs' attorneys involved in the case ""do not, except at a high level and very generally, permit assessment of the extent to which the five firms that constitute class counsel unreasonably duplicated efforts,"" Massullo said. Still, she said she was ""satisfied that this litigation was a monumental undertaking"" that required a ""vast number of hours."" Class named plaintiffs United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and Employers Benefit Trust objected to the requested legal fees as excessive. A lawyer for the union, Stephen Siegel, partner at Chicago's Novack and Macey, argued the assistance provided by the California attorney general's office should have reduced the fees paid to private lawyers.

"Lagging in COVID-19 vaccinations, Brussels takes vaccination campaign to shops",2219,"BRUSSELS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Health authorities in Brussels began offering COVID-19 jabs in supermarkets and shopping centres on Monday to increase vaccination rates in the Belgian capital that have not kept up with Belgium's rapid inoculation roll-out. Host to the European Union and NATO, Brussels has only given vaccinations to about 65% of its population, much lower than the surrounding Belgian regions, mainly because people did not respond to requests to go to vaccination centres. ""We're really trying to bring, as much as possible, the vaccine to the people,"" Inge Neven, crisis manager responsible for the COVID-19 response in Brussels, told Reuters. Belgium has recorded 25,360 deaths from the coronavirus, one of the world's highest tolls per capita. Neven said Brussels was home to 182 different nationalities, which made the job of reaching people to encourage them to go to a vaccination centre much harder. Within Brussels, vaccination is also lower in poorer neighbourhoods, even though many are just short walk from the steel and glass EU buildings and the leafy suburbs inhabited by diplomats and officials. ""We are selecting a number of areas where a lot of people are passing by and so we try really to offer them the vaccine at their place, in their environment, where they work, where they go to school, where they live, and also where they shop,"" she said. One shopper, who gave her name as Esther, said the vaccination points near supermarket check-outs had helped her overcome her fears about having a needle in her arm. ""I didn't want to but I've changed my mind,"" she said. ""Before I didn't want to because I was afraid, but now I have seen other people taking it who feel better, people in my family who've had it and it hasn't been a problem, so I decided to get one too,"" she added. Others worry that Belgium will follow neighbouring France and require proof of vaccination to be able to go into cinemas and cafes. ""I didn't want to do it (get vaccinated). I didn't want to do it but as it's going to become like it is in France, to go into a restaurant you have to show your pass, now I'm doing it,"" another shopper Rudi Jacquet said.

U.S. pending home sales drop for second straight month in July,2384,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes declined for the second consecutive month in July in step with limited supply that's been unable to keep up with demand from potential homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 1.8% after dropping a revised 2.0% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would increase 0.4%. Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later. ""The market may be starting to cool slightly, but at the moment there is not enough supply to match the demand from would-be buyers,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Inventory is slowly increasing and home shoppers should begin to see more options in the coming months."" Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply, with the median price for new single-family homes now topping $390,000 and for existing homes just under $360,000. Compared with one year ago, pending home sales were down 8.5%. ""The highly competitive real estate market we saw in the first six months of 2021 squeezed available inventory to record-lows and pushed prices to new highs just as summer emerged, leaving many first-time buyers feeling frustrated,"" said George Ratiu, manager of economic research for Realtor.com. ""However, in a noticeable shift, homeowners responded to market trends and started listing homes in larger numbers."" Only the West region posted a month-over-month gain in contract activity in July, while the Midwest, Northeast and the South all reported declines. All four regions saw transactions decrease on a year-over-year basis. ""Homes listed for sale are still garnering great interest, but the multiple, frenzied offers – sometimes double-digit bids on one property – have dissipated in most regions,"" Yun said.

German Social Democrats power ahead in latest setback for Merkel's conservatives,3174,"BERLIN, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) extended their lead over Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in the latest poll published on Monday, increasing the chances of a left-leaning coalition government following a general election next month. The Insa poll for Bild TV showed support for the SPD and their chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz jump by 2 percentage points to 25%, the highest reading in the survey in four years. Merkel's conservatives and their top candidate Armin Laschet lost 3 points to reach a record low at 20%. The ecologist Greens stood at 16.5%, the business-friendly FDP at 13.5%, the far-right AfD at 11% and far-left Die Linke at 7%. Insa head Hermann Binkert said Laschet could currently only become chancellor with a three-way 'Jamaica coalition' consisting of the black conservatives, the Greens and the yellow FDP. ""Olaf Scholz would have four options in which to lead the government,"" Binkert added. This included a so-called ""traffic light"" coalition with the Greens and the FDP and a more left-leaning coalition with the Greens and Die Linke. Another possibility would be an SPD-led coalition government supported by the Greens and conservatives, or an SPD-led coalition supported by the conservatives and the FPD. The conservatives rallied behind Laschet, promising to go on the offensive after he struggled to revive their campaign in a televised debate with rivals. Laschet, leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), was judged to have lost the heated televised debate with his two main rivals on Sunday, a snap poll suggested, as surveys showed his party falling behind the SPD. Laschet has been under fire since he was caught on camera laughing during a visit last month to a flood-stricken town, but senior party officials praised his combative style in Sunday's debate even if it did not immediately appear to win over voters. ""We have to fight for the next four weeks,"" Jens Spahn, a Laschet ally and CDU health minister, told Bild TV, rejecting suggestions that the conservative alliance should drop Laschet in favour of Bavarian conservative Markus Soeder. ""You don't change the coach during the game,"" Spahn said. The CDU's slide marks a remarkable fall for the party after 16 years in office and four straight national election victories under Merkel, who plans to step down after the election. Soeder, who earlier this year ran against Laschet to be the conservative chancellor candidate, said his erstwhile rival had laid a good foundation for the next three-way debate in two weeks. ""From my point of view, this was exactly what we had hoped for to give us new momentum,"" Soeder told reporters in Munich. ""It also motivates our own election campaigners."" Laschet on Monday brushed off the post-debate snap poll, which showed that of voters surveyed by pollster Forsa, 36% believed SPD candidate Olaf Scholz won, ahead of 30% for Greens candidate Annalena Baerbock and 25% for Laschet. Scholz is the most popular of the candidates in the polls. Despite the SPD's lead, they would still need to team up with two other parties to govern.

Planning for shifting merger enforcement under the new administration,8401,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 30, 2021 - New leadership at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have expressed strong concerns that prior administrations did not vigorously enforce the antitrust laws and failed to prevent widespread consolidation in many industries. They believe this lack of enforcement has led to higher prices for consumers and reduced wages for workers, curbed economic growth and innovation, and curtailed opportunities for small and independent companies. These views are also reflected in President Biden's recent Executive Order on Promoting Competition that asks the antitrust agencies to step up their enforcement of the antitrust laws and reduce corporate consolidation. What does all this mean for companies considering growth through strategic acquisitions? They should plan for a broader range of outcomes — in types of questions to be ready to address, in timing, and in divestitures needed to assure a closing — before entering into a merger agreement. At a minimum, a government review of proposed mergers is likely to take longer and to cover a broader array of issues. The current administration is also more likely to pursue enforcement actions against proposed mergers, especially for mergers in Big Tech, health care, and agriculture, industries targeted by the President as areas of concern. The first announced salvo regarding heightened review of proposed mergers occurred in early February when the Acting Chair of the FTC announced that the agency would be reassessing its long-established internal processes and procedures for reviewing merger filings. At the same time, the FTC ""temporarily"" suspended its power to grant early termination to the required 30-day waiting period for transactions that pose no credible antitrust concern. More than six months later, this temporary suspension remains in effect with no end in sight even for proposed mergers that do not even remotely raise competitive issues. The FTC and DOJ, which share responsibility for enforcing the antitrust laws, also announced immediately after the President's Executive Order in July that they are rewriting their joint merger guidelines that they use to investigate and challenge mergers. These bipartisan guidelines, last revised in 2010 under President Obama for horizontal mergers (mergers among current and potential competitors) and in 2020 under President Trump for vertical mergers (mergers among firms that provide different supply chain functions), are the government's well-established playbook for determining whether a merger is illegal. The FTC Chair and acting head of the DOJ's Antitrust Division stated that they plan to revise the merger guidelines to counter years of ""overly permissive"" merger enforcement as part of a broader effort to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws. Lina Khan, the new Chair of the FTC, and Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, have each stated their intention to ramp up merger enforcement. The revised merger guidelines are likely to include new areas of concern such as the impact of a merger on workers' wages, whether small and independent companies may be adversely affected, and whether underrepresented groups may be disadvantaged. These issues will be in addition to bedrock antitrust issues that include higher prices or reduced quality for consumers. The staff at the FTC and DOJ, under guidance from the new leaders, are already broadening their typical in-depth investigations to cover the new playbook of issues. The revised merger guidelines are also likely to capture mergers with lower combined market shares than the standards in the current set of merger guidelines. For example, mergers with a combined market share below 30% will likely face a more in-depth investigation than in the past and a higher likelihood of being challenged by the government. The guidelines are also likely to offer clearer guidance regarding acquisitions of potential or nascent competitors and ""killer acquisitions"" of up-start companies that could independently develop into meaningful competitors. The FTC and DOJ more recently have been focusing on these types of acquisitions in the high technology and life sciences sectors, and the revised guidelines may specifically address the conditions under which these mergers will be challenged. The agencies, however, are not waiting to issue revised merger guidelines before increasing their enforcement actions. When Aon attempted its $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson, their agreement to divest certain assets satisfied concerns expressed by the European Commission, which subsequently approved the merger. The Department of Justice, however, rejected the parties' divestiture offer to resolve issues in the United States and in June sued to block the merger. The parties subsequently terminated the merger and Aon had to pay a $1 billion reverse break fee to Willis Towers Watson pursuant to the merger agreement. The FTC also announced in early August a new and unprecedented policy of issuing letters warning companies that their mergers will remain under continuous scrutiny. Under this new policy, the FTC is informing these companies that due to the ""tidal wave"" of merger filings, the agency can no longer fully investigate all deals during the required statutory deadlines by issuing standard requests for additional information. Although the companies can merge due to the expiration of the required waiting period, the continuous-scrutiny letter states they are doing so ""at their own risk"" because the FTC may later challenge the merger after its consummation. This new FTC policy may not prevent companies from closing their mergers, especially those where the companies are contractually obligated to close after the expiration of the required waiting period, but it does add uncertainty to the 40-year merger review process. The FTC has provided no further guidance on its new policy. At this time, no one knows how many companies are receiving warning letters, how long these ongoing investigations may last, and if in fact the FTC is going to sue to challenge any of these mergers. The FTC and DOJ, however, cannot unilaterally stop a proposed merger or order companies to unwind a consummated merger. To stop a proposed merger, the agencies must seek injunctive relief in federal court where there are many precedents that provide strong guard rails against overly aggressive merger enforcement. Likewise, the FTC and DOJ cannot block or unwind a merger absent a trial at which the government has the burden to demonstrate that the merger is unlawful. Companies seeking mergers may need to consider more seriously the prospects of litigation to ultimately close their mergers or potentially the need for additional or unexpected divestitures. Companies should also be mindful of their obligations in their merger agreements, which cover both buyers' and sellers' required efforts to close a merger, including divestiture and litigation commitments, timing for the outside closing date, and prospects for a reverse break fee in the event the merger does not close. It will be important to plan in advance to address quickly the full playbook of new questions that may arise. Strategic growth through M&A will continue but will require more advanced planning to ensure closing under conditions that are commercially acceptable. Opinions expressed are those of the author.

"Afghanistan's healthcare system near collapse, aid agencies warn",2776,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's healthcare system is at risk of collapse, two major aid agencies told Reuters, after foreign donors stopped providing aid following the Taliban takeover. After the United States withdraw the bulk of its remaining troops last month, the Taliban accelerated its military campaign, taking control of the capital Kabul on Aug. 15. International donors including the World Bank and European Union froze funding to Afghanistan shortly afterwards. ""One of the great risks for the health system here is basically to collapse because of lack of support,"" said Filipe Ribeiro, Afghanistan representative for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), one of the largest medical aid agencies in the country. ""The overall health system in Afghanistan is understaffed, under-equipped and underfunded, for years. And the great risk is that this underfunding will continue over time."" Necephor Mghendi, Afghanistan head of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC), said the healthcare system, which was already fragile and heavily reliant on foreign aid, had been left under additional strain. ""The humanitarian needs on the ground are massive,"" he said. INCREASED DEMAND Both aid agencies said that while their ground operations were broadly unaffected, they had seen a significant increase in demand as other facilities are unable to fully function. Mghendi said closures of Afghan banks had meant almost all humanitarian agencies have been unable to access funds, leaving vendors and staff unpaid. Compounding the issue, medical supplies will now need to be restocked earlier than expected. ""Supplies that were supposed to last for three months will not be able to last three months. We may need to replenish much earlier than that,"" Mghendi said. Ribeiro said MSF had stockpiled medical supplies before the takeover but that with flights disrupted and land borders in disarray, it was unclear when more might reach the country. The World Health Organization said on Monday that a plane carrying 12.5 tonnes of medicines and health supplies had landed at Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, the first such shipment since the Taliban took control. read more During its period in power from 1996-2001, the Islamist militant Taliban had an uneasy relationship with foreign aid agencies, eventually expelling many, including MSF, in 1998. This time, the group has said it welcomes foreign donors, and will protect the rights of foreign and local staff - a commitment that has so far been upheld, Ribeiro said. ""They actually ask us to stay, and they asked us to keep running our operations the way we were running them before,"" he said. ""The relations are, so far, pretty reassuring.""

"Coronavirus booster shots can help vulnerable, WHO Europe head says",1945,"COPENHAGEN, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A COVID-19 booster shot is a way to keep the most vulnerable safe and not a luxury robbing people who have yet to have even a single jab, a senior World Health Organization official said on Monday. The comments from WHO Europe head Hans Kluge appeared to be more positive than the U.N. health body's past assessments of the third vaccinations being administered by a growing number of countries. Last week, WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said data on the third shots was inconclusive. read more He had earlier said they should be halted and authorities should focus on getting the doses to poorer nations. On Monday, Kluge told a press briefing that more studies were showing that third doses protect vulnerable people. ""A third dose of vaccine is not a luxury booster (that is) taken away from someone who is still waiting for a first jab. It's basically a way to keep the most vulnerable safe,"" he said. Kluge said more evidence was still needed and urged European countries with excess vaccines to share them with other states, particularly in Eastern Europe and Africa. An increase in COVID-19 transmission rates across Europe over the last two weeks, combined with low levels of vaccination in some countries, was ""deeply worrying"", he added. The Czech Republic said on Monday it would offer booster shots to anyone vaccinated at least eight months earlier, joining a growing list of countries stepping up measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus Delta variant. read more Israel began offering a COVID-19 booster to children as young as 12 on Sunday. read more In response to the WHO director-general's comments last week, Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE) said a third dose of its vaccine, the most widely used in the Western world, spurred more than three times as many antibodies against the coronavirus as the second shot. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Czechs to offer booster vaccine shot to all after eight months,1444,"PRAGUE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Czech government will offer a booster COVID-19 vaccine shot from Sept. 20 to any previously vaccinated person, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Monday. The Czech Republic, a country of 10.7 million, has been one of the countries worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as measured by deaths per population, with over 30,400 victims. Nearly 1.68 million Czechs have contracted the virus, and many more are estimated to have caught it without being tested. The government's coronavirus task force said on Twitter that the boosters were strongly recommended for people over 60 but would also be available for all who had completed previous vaccinations, either by a two-dose or single-dose schemes. The government will use Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for the boosters for those who completed a regular vaccination at least eight months earlier, Vojtech told a news conference shown live on television. As of Monday, 5.73 million people have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, mostly from Pfizer/BioNTech, and another 197,254 received the one-dose vaccine made by Johnson and Johnson. Separately, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Czech Television the government will offer financial bonuses to general practitioners who convince more people over 65 to undergo initial vaccinations, to boost the vaccination rate among the oldest citizens.

Theranos founder claims abuse by ex-boyfriend in fraud trial -court filings,2551,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Theranos Inc founder Elizabeth Holmes has accused her former boyfriend, who was president of the blood-testing startup, of abusing her, court documents unsealed on Saturday showed, hinting at a possible defense strategy with jury selection in her fraud trial set to start next week. In court filings submitted more than 18 months ago, Holmes' lawyers said they planned to present evidence that Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically in a relationship that spanned more than a decade. That includes the period when the company claimed its technology could enable a wide array of medical tests with a few drops of blood. Theranos, which Holmes founded in 2003 at the age of 19, collapsed in March 2018 when she, Balwani and the $9 billion company were charged with fraud by U.S. regulators. Theranos had made Holmes, a Stanford University dropout, a Silicon Valley star. In the filings Holmes' lawyers argued that the alleged ""intimate partner abuse"" was relevant to the question of whether she knew that financial information provided to investors and others was false. Holmes intends to blame Balwani, alleging he exerted controlled over her through the abusive relationship, the filings indicate. Balwani, whose case is being handled separately, has denied the allegations. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes arrives at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building to attend a federal court hearing in San Jose, California, U.S. May 4, 2021. REUTERS/Kate Munsch ""Mr. Balwani unequivocally denies that he engaged in any abuse at any time,"" his lawyers wrote in a December 2019 filing.

"King lauds Osaka for mental health stand, calls it 'fantastic progress'",2722,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Tennis great Billie Jean King has praised Naomi Osaka for speaking out on mental health issues and her stand against racial injustice. Japan's Osaka withdrew from this year's French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to do media duties, which she said had contributed to the depression issues she had struggled with for years. The 23-year-old, a four-times Grand Slam champion, also pulled out of Wimbledon, leading to a broader conversation about mental health in sport. Osaka was joined by King, mercurial Australian Nick Kyrgios and former American player Mardy Fish for a discussion hosted by Racquet Magazine on the eve of the U.S. Open. ""Everyone loves you guys. They listen to you guys, and I think it's great when you talk and talk about your feelings. Kids need that,"" King, a leading figure in the campaign for gender equality in tennis, told Osaka. ""When I was outed in '81 for being gay, I lost everything in 24 hours. You guys can talk about these things and you're celebrated. Other people have the same issues. But we couldn't talk about it the way you get to. ""Every time I go to any place now I have to talk about mental health. Why? Because you guys talked about it. That's fantastic progress."" The 77-year-old has in the past likened Osaka's off-court stance to that of the Original Nine, a group of players led by King who fought tirelessly to start a professional women's tennis tour, which led to the creation of the WTA in 1973. Osaka was lauded for supporting the ""Black Lives Matter"" campaign as she highlighted racial injustice by wearing different face masks at her 2020 U.S. Open matches bearing the names of African Americans who died in recent years. ""After my first Slam, I was supposed to be the good girl,"" Osaka said. ""But now that I'm talking about stuff that bothers me, I think it's confusing a lot of people. I honestly don't know what people think about me.""

WHO opens air bridge to Afghanistan with medical supplies,1482,"GENEVA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A plane carrying World Health Organization medicines and health supplies landed in Afghanistan on Monday, the UN health agency said, the first shipment to get in since the country came under the control of the Taliban.

The WHO had warned on Friday that medical supplies would run out within days in Afghanistan, announcing that it hoped to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by then with the help of Pakistani authorities. The 12.5 tonnes of supplies that arrived on Monday consist of trauma kits and emergency health kits, enough to cover the basic health needs of more than 200,000 people as well as provide 3,500 surgical procedures and treat 6,500 trauma patients, the WHO said. They will be delivered to 40 health facilities in 29 provinces across Afghanistan, it added. The plane, which was provided by the government of Pakistan, flew from Dubai to Mazar-i-Sharif airport. It was the first of three flights planned with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to fill urgent shortages in medicines and medical supplies in Afghanistan.

U.S. says Brooklyn woman who aided Islamic State is arrested after skipping hearing,1912,"NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A Brooklyn woman who faces a resentencing for supporting Islamic State but skipped a court hearing because she feared being sent back to prison has been arrested in New Mexico, U.S. prosecutors said. Sinmyah Amera Ceasar, who prosecutors said used the name ""Umm Nutella"" in her role as a ""committed recruiter"" for Islamic State, was arrested on Friday afternoon by FBI agents following a nationwide search, prosecutors said in a letter on Sunday. Ceasar, 26, had missed a scheduled appearance in Brooklyn federal court on Aug. 25, one week after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan threw out what it called her ""shockingly low"" four-year prison term and ordered her resentenced. read more In their letter to U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, prosecutors said Ceasar, when she was arrested, did not have the GPS ankle bracelet she was supposed to wear, and before fleeing had told others she ""expected to be sent to prison"" at the Aug. 25 conference.

Federal public defenders who represent Ceasar were not immediately available on Monday for comment. Ceasar had received her four-year term in 2019 from late U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who cited her need for educational and mental health support after a lifetime of abuse. In throwing out that sentence, the appeals court called it too short relative to ""similar terrorism crimes"" and did not ensure just punishment. read more Ceasar had been out of prison since July 2020, having received credit for time served.

"India's COVID vaccine supply jumps, raising export hopes",3287,"NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India's rising output of COVID-19 vaccines and the inoculation of more than half its adult population with at least one dose are raising hopes the country will return as an exporter within months, ramping up from early next year. After donating or selling 66 million doses to nearly 100 countries, India barred exports in the middle of April to focus on domestic immunisation as infections exploded, upsetting the inoculation plans of many African and South Asian countries. India's daily vaccinations surpassed 10 million doses on Friday, with national vaccine production more than doubling since April and set to rise again in the coming weeks. New production lines have been set up, a vaccine developed by Cadila Healthcare (CADI.NS) won recent approval, and commercial production of Russia's Sputnik V is starting in India. The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, is now producing about 150 million doses a month of its version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shot, more than twice its April output of about 65 million, a source with knowledge of the matter said. ""No fixed timeline on exports but the company hopes to restart in a few months,"" said the source, who declined to be named without approval to talk on the matter. SII, which has previously indicated exports could resume by year-end, did not respond to a request for comment. Global vaccine sharing platform COVAX hopes India will restart foreign sales sooner than later. ""With successful national vaccination and the arrival of more products, we are hoping that Indian supply to COVAX will resume as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson for the platform's co-lead GAVI told Reuters in an email. India, a major international producer of many other vaccines, could play a ""similarly transformative role in the global response to COVID-19,"" the spokesperson said. India's health ministry and the foreign ministry, which coordinates vaccine exports, did not respond to a request for comment. Bharat Biotech, the maker of India's first domestically developed COVID-19 shot, on Sunday inaugurated a new factory with a production capacity of 10 million doses a month. It said it was ""marching towards"" a goal of a total annual capacity of about 1 billion doses of the drug, Covaxin. read more Infections, meanwhile, are again rising in India after an explosive outbreak in April and May.

A government source told Reuters in June the U.S. experience showed that vaccinations tend to slow down after a big majority of people get their shots. That might give SII a chance to export excess output, said the source. The chief of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party said this month India could produce as many as 1.1 billion vaccine doses between September and December, enough to fully immunise all adults in the country this year. read more India has so far given emergency authorisation to six COVID-19 shots, four of which are being produced locally.

The vehicle and pedestrians, however, came into contact before it came to a complete halt,"" Toyota said in a statement on Monday. Aramitsu Kitazono was not seriously injured in the incident, but had to pull out of the Games judo event on Saturday because of cuts and bruises, further embarrassing the Japanese company, which along with other global automakers is trying to develop autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads. The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly. Operators will now be given control over how fast the vehicles travel with two safety staff members, rather than one, on board to look out for pedestrians, a Toyota spokesperson said. Warning sounds on e-Palettes will also be turned up and pedestrian guides at busy crossings in the athletes village will also be increased to 20 from six said the company, which is cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident. The 2020 Paralympic Games began on Tuesday in Tokyo, even as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak, with record daily cases and an overwhelmed health service. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"New Zealand's Auckland stays in lockdown, officials report Pfizer-linked death",2777,"WELLINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday extended a lockdown in Auckland by two weeks, while officials reported the country's first death linked to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. New Zealand had been largely virus-free for months, barring a small number of cases in February, until an outbreak of the Delta variant imported from Australia prompted Ardern to order a snap nationwide lockdown on Aug. 17. Infections in the outbreak have reached 562 but the number of daily new cases dropped to 53 on Monday, the lowest over the past five days. ""I know we all feel encouraged that our number is lower than what we've seen in the last few days and I know we're all willing for that trend to remain,"" Ardern said at a news conference. ""The job is not yet done and we do need to keep going."" Around 1.7 million Aucklanders will remain in strict level 4 lockdown for another two weeks, while restrictions for the remainder of the country will be eased slightly to a level 3. Ardern's tough and swift lockdowns, along with closing the international border from March 2020, were credited with reining in COVID-19 in the country. However, the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Around 21% of the population of 5.1 million people have been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. VACCINE DEATH The health ministry on Monday announced a woman had died due to myocarditis, which is known to be a rare side effect of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N) (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms. The health ministry did not provide the woman's age. Pfizer in New Zealand did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. read more Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the risk of myocarditis after the vaccine was a lot lower than risk of myocarditis after being infected with COVID-19. ""And that's part of the reason we've been very open about this case,"" Bloomfield said. ""It's of great interest internationally as well because it's one of the few cases where we've got the full range of evidence around the side effects and then been able to explain this death."" New Zealand has provisionally approved use of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines, but only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for rollout to the public. Ardern said the country has 840,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remaining and it continues to receive 350,000 doses each week. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Russia sees possible increase in West Nile virus cases this autumn,1250,"MOSCOW, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Russia warned on Monday of a possible increase in West Nile virus infections this autumn as mild temperatures and heavy precipitation create favourable conditions for the mosquitos that carry it. Originally from Africa, the virus has spread in Europe, Asia and North America. It is mainly transmitted through mosquito bites and can lead to a fatal neurological disease in humans, although most people infected never develop any symptoms. Scientists have said that milder temperatures attributed to climate change could cause diseases such as the West Nile virus to become more widespread. ""In light of favourable climatic conditions this year - an abundance of precipitation... a warm and long autumn, a high number of (virus) carriers could be observed in the autumn,"" Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer health watchdog, said. The virus causes West Nile fever in around 20% of cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. It is related to the Zika, dengue and yellow fever viruses. More than 80% of Russia's West Nile fever cases are recorded in its southwest region. There is no vaccine against the virus in humans although one exists for horses, the WHO says.

Jenner taps DWT partners for antitrust practice co-leads,3501,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Jenner & Block announced on Monday it has brought aboard a pair of Davis Wright Tremaine partners as new co-leaders of its antitrust and competition law practice. Chris Renner will co-lead the practice from Chicago while Doug Litvack will co-lead from Washington, D.C. They'll head the practice alongside a third partner, D.C.-based Lee Van Voorhis, who joined Jenner in 2016. Both Renner and Litvack had prior roles in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau. Prior to joining Davis Wright Tremaine in April 2020, Renner was a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner. Litvack had associate roles at Jones Day and McDermott Will & Emery prior to joining Davis Wright Tremaine in 2018. Renner and Litvack described themselves as full-service antitrust litigators, with Renner mostly representing plaintiffs and Litvack representing defendants in antitrust actions. Litvack and Renner were among the Davis Wright Tremaine attorneys defending Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica Health Systems Inc in court over its ability to cancel contracts with Ohio-based hospital McLaren St. Luke's. St. Luke's this week asked the full 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a three-judge panel's ruling siding with ProMedica. ""We have this diversified, complementary focus,"" Renner said. A representative for Davis Wright Tremaine did not respond to a request for comment. Their move to Jenner comes as the Biden administration has been stepping up antitrust enforcement. Last month, the president signed a sweeping executive order that urged agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. Meanwhile, the administration added more detail to its lawsuit against Facebook Inc, once again asking a judge to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. A federal judge dismissed the FTC's first lawsuit against Facebook in June. ""I don’t think it’s any great shock to say we’re in an antitrust moment in our country unlike any I’ve seen in my 25-year career. Antitrust is in the spotlight like it hasn’t been in that timeline,"" said Van Voorhis. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Latham & Watkins, Mayer Brown, Shearman & Sterling, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati have all added Justice Department and FTC alumni in recent months. Renner and Litvack said they expect most of their antitrust clients to come over with them. Jenner has its own slate of antitrust clients it is representing in litigation, including Comcast Corp, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, McKesson Corp, and Tegna Inc. ""We thought long and hard what opportunities there would be with potentially other law firms to grow our practice. Jenner was the perfect fit for us,"" Litvack said.

Australian state warns COVID-19 hospitalisations to peak in October,2970,"CANBERRA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Intensive care cases in Australia's New South Wales will hit a peak in October as COVID-19 infections accumulate, said the premier of the country's most populous state, which reported record daily new infections on Monday. New South Wales, the epicentre of Australia's current outbreak, declared a record 1,290 new cases as the nation struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the state was preparing for additional hospitalisations as infections pile up, before increased vaccination coverage starts to ease the pressure. ""We anticipate that the worst month, the worst time for our intensive care unit will be in October,"" Berejiklian said in the state capital Sydney. ""We will need to manage things differently because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but we will cope."" There are 840 people in hospital for COVID-19 in New South Wales, with 137 in intensive care and 48 requiring ventilation. The state reported four additional fatalities on Monday, taking the COVID-19 death toll to 1,003 in Australia, the last of the Group of 20 big economies to exceed that milestone. read more A lone woman, wearing a protective face mask, walks across an unusually quiet city centre bridge on the first day of a lockdown as the state of Victoria looks to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Melbourne, Australia, July 16, 2021. REUTERS/Sandra Sanders One of the four was the first known death of an Aboriginal person. The 50-year-old man, who was not vaccinated, lived in western NSW where vaccination rates are particularly low, raising fears there will be many more deaths there. ""Aboriginal people were deemed to be vulnerable communities, vulnerable groups in the vaccine rollout. And clearly that has failed,"" Linda Burney, Labour's Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, told reporters. Nationwide, a record 1,375 new COVID-19 cases were reported. Australia has used a system of strict lockdowns and quarantine to keep coronavirus infection and death rates lower than in most comparable nations, however the Delta variant is now pressuring health services. Just over 33% of those aged 16 and older have received two vaccine doses, well below most comparable nations, according to government data. The delays were partly because of changed health advice over the use of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine, which was to be the backbone of the country's immunisation programme, after rare cases of blood clots among some recipients. The pace of vaccination in Australia has since risen to a seven-day average of more than 250,000 doses a day, the fastest rate ever, according to a Reuters analysis. Australia's second-most populous state, Victoria, reported 73 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, a day after Premier Dan Andrews said he would extend lockdown measures as daily infections reached the highest in a year.

Electric-car crash is double pain for Evergrande,3192,"HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It doesn’t take many bits malfunctioning in a traditional car to bring it to a screeching halt. So too with Evergrande’s (3333.HK) electric car dreams. The indebted Chinese property developer has seen the market value of its auto unit plummet 90% since an April peak to just $10 billion. Investors are left with a hodge-podge of assets whose survival as a business relies on Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan staying on course. Read the announcements of Evergrande New Energy Vehicle (0708.HK), also known as Evergrande Auto, and it is progressing towards its goal of becoming the world’s largest and most powerful electric vehicle enterprise. Under the hood however it is mostly a healthcare business ranging from hospital joint ventures to health-focused property developments. That’s the engine onto which it began bolting electric car deals in 2018. Investments there will help double the overall year-on-year first-half net loss to about $740 million, the company warned this month. The real damage has been caused by its parent and 65% shareholder. In May, Evergrande sold $1.4 billion of Auto’s shares and says it could sell more. Chinese regulators have publicly ordered Evergrande to get its debt under control. Auto’s 2020 accounts being presented as a going concern relied on extending the term of an existing loan from its parent, a one-year letter of support from its parent, plus capital raisings that brought in Tencent (0700.HK) and Sequoia among others. Market perceptions matter enormously to cash-guzzling early-stage companies whose high valuations underpin regular share sales to fund heavy spending. A planned Shanghai listing for Auto appears stalled, while Hui’s efforts to get it included in the stock connect have been overtaken by rivals Xpeng (9868.HK) and Li Auto , , both of which listed in Hong Kong recently and are poised to join the powerful system which allows mainland investors to buy the city’s shares directly. Hui has a track record of finding an extra gear and bolstering his companies’ shares just when the going gets dicey, but Auto’s high value was also a hoped-for crutch for his flagship property developer. Instead, this car crash represents double pain. Follow @JennHughes13 on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Shares in Hong Kong-listed Evergrande New Energy Vehicle, also known as Evergrande Auto, have fallen 90% from an April peak which valued the company at $87 billion. The company warned on Aug. 9 that its first-half net loss would double due to the cost of its electric vehicle business, which is in an early investment phase. Breakingviews

"Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New Orleans",6348,"NEW ORLEANS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida plowed into Louisiana from the Gulf of Mexico as a fierce Category 4 storm on Sunday, lashing the coast with 150 mile-per-hour winds, torrential downpours and pounding surf that submerged much of the shoreline under several feet of water. Power was knocked out Sunday night to the entire New Orleans metropolitan area with the failure of all eight transmission lines that deliver electricity to Louisiana's largest city, the utility company Entergy Louisiana reported. One transmission tower collapsed into the Mississippi River, according to the Jefferson Parish Emergency Management Department. U.S. President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in Louisiana, ordering federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in more than two-dozen storm-stricken parishes. Ida slammed ashore around noon near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a hub of the Gulf's offshore energy industry, blasting the coast with hurricane-force winds extending 50 miles (80 km) out from the eye of the storm. Landfall came 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina, one of the most catastrophic on record, struck the Gulf Coast. Sunday night, the sheriff's office in Ascension Parish reported the first known U.S. fatality from the storm - a 60-year-old man killed by a tree falling on his home near Baton Rouge, the state capital. Flash flooding was reported by the National Hurricane Center across southeastern Louisiana. Nearly all offshore Gulf oil production was suspended, and major ports along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts were closed to shipping. read more Residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days in advance of Ida. Those riding out the storm in their homes in New Orleans, less than 100 miles inland to the north, braced for the toughest test yet of major upgrades to a levee system constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from Katrina. read more ""I almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of Katrina,"" Janet Rucker, a lifelong New Orleans resident and recently retired sales manager who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog, Deuce. ""This is just not good for our nerves and our psyche."" The storm's approach forced the suspension of emergency medical services in New Orleans and elsewhere across a state already reeling from a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections that has strained Louisiana's healthcare system. For an estimated 2,450 COVID-19 patients hospitalized statewide, many in intensive care units, evacuation was not an option. A loss of generator power at the Thibodaux Regional Health System hospital in Lafourche Parish, southwest of New Orleans, forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor, the state Health Department confirmed to Reuters. Farren Clark, a Nicholls State University professor who studied Katrina's impact and was riding out the storm at his mother's home in Thibodaux, called the arrival of Ida ""nerve-wracking."" ""I can hear the howl of the storm getting stronger,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""Having done research on Katrina, it is a little bit triggering."" Michael Lewis, 45, restaurant owner in nearby Houma, said he could see shingles blown off his roof and a downed fence through a window of his home but was unable to check the full extent of damage as the storm raged. A parking sign lies in the street as Hurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana, in New Orleans, Louisiana, August 29, 2021. REUTERS/Marco Bello ""It's way too dangerous to go outside right now,"" he said in a phone interview. Officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said they expected the city's newly reinforced levees to hold, though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places. ""This is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times,"" Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a news briefing. Hundreds of miles of new levees were built around New Orleans after flooding from Katrina inundated much of the low-lying city, especially historically Black neighborhoods. That monster storm claimed more than 1,800 lives. Edwards voiced confidence in the $14.5 billion in levee improvements since then, saying they were ""built for this moment."" WIDESPREAD OUTAGES Power outages were widespread in the first hours of the storm, with more than 1 million Louisiana homes and businesses losing electricity by late Sunday night, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.US. Just three days after emerging as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, Ida had intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and swept ashore with top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported. As Ida pushed inland past to New Orleans over the next 10 hours, its maximum sustained winds diminished to 105 mph, ranking it as a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, according to the NHC. Palm trees trembled as rain blasted in sideways through New Orleans on Sunday, where retiree Robert Ruffin, 68, had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel. ""I thought it was safer,"" he said. ""It's double-trouble this time because of COVID."" Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet (1.8 m) along parts of the coast. Videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of Highway 90 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast into a choppy river. The NHC also warned of potentially catastrophic wind damage and up to 2 feet (61 cm) of rainfall in some areas. ""We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees,"" said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish, and one of the most vulnerable areas along Gulf Coast. The parish later issued an alert on Facebook urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee. Offshore energy operations in the region were at a virtual standstill. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said nearly 300 offshore oil and gas platforms were evacuated, cutting Gulf-based petroleum and natural gas production by 96% and 94%, respectively. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"A weary Australia plans reopening as COVID-19 death toll hits 1,000",4409,"SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - As Australia's COVID-19 deaths exceed 1,000, a grim toll but modest by global standards, a country that has used relentless lockdowns now faces perhaps its biggest health policy challenge of the pandemic - how to reopen. The highly infectious Delta variant has breached the country's fortress-style controls and entrenched itself deep enough in Sydney, Australia's biggest city, and with a foothold in Melbourne, that authorities have dispensed with plans to eliminate it. Instead, they plan to ramp up Australia's lagging vaccination effort and live with COVID-19, an approach that would help struggling businesses but which is opposed by states determined to crush the disease. Australia reported four fatalities on Monday, taking the total death toll from COVID-19 to 1,003, according to government data. It has logged an average of two to three deaths a day recently, the data shows. But while deaths are creeping higher, infections are surging to successive record highs above 1,200 a day. With more than half the population in lockdown, even those areas with little or no infections are affected. The exuberance that accompanied Australia's early suppression success has since been replaced with community frustration at a delayed vaccine programme that has only recently picked up pace. Just over 33% of those aged 16 and older have received two vaccine doses, well below most comparable nations, according to a Reuters tracker. As the weary nation reopens, authorities hope to avoid the soaring infections and rising death experienced in countries such as Britain and the United States - which recently posted more than 1,000 deaths in a single day. The lesson for Australia is that mask-wearing should not be discarded as restrictions ease and that classrooms should be better ventilated to protect students from the airborne virus, said epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre. ""Wearing a mask is a small price to pay to get that additional layer of control,"" said MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute, UNSW Medicine. ""We'll need a vaccines-plus strategy as well as ventilation."" PUSHBACK AGAINST LIVE-WITH-IT PLAN Australia plans to start easing restrictions once 70% of those aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated, expected late in the year. After 80% comes a gradual reopening of international travel, according to the government-backed plan modelled by the Melbourne-based Doherty Institute. Prime Minister Scott Morrison wants Australia to treat COVID-19 like the flu as vaccination rates rise. ""That is our goal, to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it,"" he said last week. But some largely infection-free states, including Queensland and Western Australia, are pushing back as they watch health services at the centre of the Delta outbreak in the Sydney area come under stress. There are 840 people in hospital being treated for COVID-19 in the epicentre, with 137 in intensive care and48 requiring ventilation. Mark McGowan, premier of Western Australia, said his iron ore-exporting state wanted to continue to ""crush and kill"" the virus, with lockdowns when necessary. The outbreaks and lockdowns are devastating tourism operators, said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. ""We are not in lockdown and that's great, but tourism is like a pipeline,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter where that pipeline is broken. If you sit at the end of the pipeline nothing is coming through."" The Australian economy, which rebounded swiftly in the pandemic's early stages, is set to contract sharply this quarter, threatening to push the country back into recession if the decline persists for the rest of the year. In the Group of 20 big economies, Australia is the last to mark 1,000 COVID-19 deaths. Among major Asia-Pacific economies, four – New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore – have well below 1,000 fatalities, with New Zealand having the lowest at just 26. Australia's rising case count means it will try to reopen under a cloud of infections when, up until the Delta strain, it was largely virus-free. Delta's high infectiousness, short incubation, and asymptomatic spread, meant it spread quickly after being first detected in Sydney in June. Caseloads are higher for younger people, who have had limited or no access to vaccines. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Evergrande to speed up asset sales as hopes swirl about gov't lifeline,5745,"HONG KONG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Too big to fail or too tough to save? As China's debt-laden No. 2 property developer lurched from one crisis to another in recent months its creditors, investors, suppliers, and bankers agonised over its fate with little hope on the horizon. But industry watchers say clear signs are now emerging that authorities at various levels are stepping in to avoid a hard landing for China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), amid worries about the ""social impact"" of a possible collapse that could cascade through the country's financial system. ""Its huge balance sheet will have a real domino effect on China,"" said Nomura chief China economist Lu Ting. ""If financial institutions lose money, they'll tighten credit to other companies and sectors."" Evergrande, whose debt has swelled to 1.95 trillion yuan ($301 billion), more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of Finland, is also set to accelerate asset sales to raise cash, company sources and analysts said. Concerns intensified in June when the developer failed to pay some commercial paper on time. Since then, its stock price has nosedived, its bonds have been cut into ""junk"" territory, and a growing number of suppliers have filed lawsuits to recover overdue payments. After having refrained from showing signs of bailing out the embattled privately-owned developer, Chinese regulators summoned senior company executives last week and issued a rare warning that it needs to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability. It's becoming increasingly clear now, analysts said, that Beijing needs to safeguard suppliers and their employees, in addition to home buyers, to ensure social stability, and policymakers may prioritise them over creditors. Banks have been instructed to roll over Evergrande's maturing loans, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, and many news reports on its woes have been removed from the internet. Those moves, coupled with the decision that a single court in Guangdong province will centrally handle lawsuits against Evergrande across the country, are the clearest signs yet that authorities are co-ordinating efforts, analysts said. Guangdong is the company's home base and the firm has been reported at various times to be in stake sale talks with various local government arms and companies there. Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment. According to financial news and data provider REDD, the government of Guangdong province is seeking feedback from Evergrande Group's major banks about forming a creditor committee for the developer, two sources briefed by bankers said. The government initiated the discussions with the banks last week and has yet to make a decision on such a move, which could pave the wave for a restructuring. Evergrande has 200,000 of its own staff, but it provides employment to 3.8 million people in the country, including construction workers, according to its website. ""Banks and trusts are relatively safe because they have collateral,"" said Oscar Choi, founder and chief investment officer of Oscar and Partners Capital. ""Construction workers are not wealthy people and need money to get food, without money they will stop working...if Evergrande has nothing to sell that will worsen its debt problem,"" Choi said Property sales, which Evergrande targets to raise 750 billion yuan this year, are its main source of cashflow, Choi noted. On Wednesday Evergrande warned interim net profit would slump as much as 39% from a year ago, as it cut the sales prices of its homes to boost revenue and on higher expenses. It is due to post the full report on Aug. 31. BARGAINING POWER If not swiftly defused, Evergrande's liabilities, which account for 2% of China's GDP, may trigger systemic risks, analysts and economists have warned. Standing at around one trillion yuan, the money owed to Evergrande's suppliers had not been widely discussed until recently when many threatened or launched legal action. read more Bondholders, on the other hand, said they are prepared for losses as Evergrande's restructuring is believed to be imminent. They also questioned how much of Evergrande's 2.3 trillion yuan of assets could be liquidated quickly, as potential buyers were expected to take advantage of its problems and seek distressed prices. Evergrande, whose other business interests include a bottling water company and an electric vehicle maker, also has been scrambling to raise funds by offloading property and land holdings in both mainland China and Hong Kong. After the regulatory rebuke last week, however, three insiders said the developer had even less bargaining power. ""Chairman Hui (Ka Yan) didn't want to sell at a cheap prices because he thought he's not desperate, but now he has probably changed his mind,"" said one person with knowledge of the sale processes, declining to be named because the talks are private. Hui did not respond to a request made via the company for comment. DOMINO EFFECT Beijing's decision to publicly step in to push for a debt resolution at Evergrande comes amid concerns about the collateral damage from its failing financial health. Construction firm Jiangsu Nantong Sanjian saw its credit ratings and outlook cut in June by two Chinese rating agencies which cited large amounts Evergrande owed the firm. State media reported earlier this month that construction work was halted on two Evergrande projects in the southwestern city of Kunming - one due to late payments. Policymakers also are concerned about the impact on home buyers who may have already put money down on apartments or arranged mortgages. The firm has hundreds of thousands of residential units yet to be delivered across China. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Osaka vows to celebrate her own accomplishments ahead of US Open title defence,1624,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka said she intends to celebrate her own achievements more and will not worry about the expectations others place on her as she prepares to begin her U.S. Open title defence. Osaka's match against Marie Bouzkova will mark the 23-year-old's first appearance at a Grand Slam since dropping out of French Open in June and skipping Wimbledon to protect her mental health. ""Recently I've been asking myself why do I feel the way I do and I realize one of the reasons is because internally, I think I'm never good enough,"" the Japanese player said in a social media post on Sunday. ""I'm gonna try to celebrate myself and my accomplishments more, I think we all should."" Osaka has emerged as the global face for the sport on the back of her four Grand Slam triumphs and outspoken views on racial injustice and police violence. She defeated Victoria Azarenka in three sets in last year's U.S. Open final before going on to win the Australian Open in February.

Osaka and fans back for first day of U.S. Open,2400,"NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka returns to the Grand Slam stage at the U.S. Open on Monday and the buzz will also be back with fans bringing the celebrated New York energy to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for what could be an exciting fortnight. While the year's final Grand Slam has been stripped of some of the marquee names, with Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams injured, it is still shaping up as an absorbing event in Flushing Meadows as Novak Djokovic bids to complete the calendar-year slam. Already the winner of the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon, the Serb needs a New York triumph to become the third man, and first since Rod Laver in 1969, to accomplish the feat. The history hunting Djokovic opens his account on Tuesday with a first round match against Danish qualifier Holger Rune. Third seed Osaka will be the headliner on Day One when she launches the defence of her U.S. Open crown against the Czech Republic's Marie Bouzkova. It will mark the 23-year-old's first appearance in a Grand Slam since dropping out of French Open in June and skipping Wimbledon to deal with mental health issues. The contest is sure to pull in a crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium with fans, who must show proof of vaccination to enter the grounds, filling seats in the massive venue after a COVID-19 pandemic forced last year's event to unfold in eerie emptiness. ""It's certainly nice to be back here now,"" said Australia's women's top seed Ash Barty. ""This week is going to be exciting. It's got fans. That's going to bring a lot of energy to this tournament. ""This is a tournament that thrives with the energy."" Opening day will see two of the big threats to Djokovic's shot at history, with second-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev and Greek third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas both in action. Medvedev, finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2019, takes on Frenchman Richard Gasquet, while French Open finalist Tsitsipas faces 2012 U.S. Open champion Briton Andy Murray. Centre court action kicks off with an all-American rematch of the 2017 women's final featuring Madison Keys and winner Sloane Stephens. A long day's play will end with the possibility of some late-night fireworks with unpredictable Australian Nick Kyrgios taking on Spain's 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the last match at Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Israel offers COVID-19 booster to all vaccinated people,2292,"JERUSALEM, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Israel on Sunday began offering a COVID-19 booster to children as young as 12, and its prime minister said a campaign that began a month ago among seniors has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant. Announcing the decision, top Israeli health officials said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine waned six months after administration, making a booster necessary. ""The third dose brings us to the level of protection achieved by the second dose, when it was fresh,"" said Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry. ""That means, people are 10 times more protected after the third vaccine dose,"" she told a news conference, where the expanded booster drive was announced. Those eligible for the third shot can receive it provided at least five months have passed since their second jab - a timeframe shorter than an eight-month interval in effect in the United States, which is considering cutting the waiting time. An Israeli man receives a third shot of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine as country launches booster shots for over 30-year-olds, in Rishon Lezion, Israel August 24, 2021. REUTERS/ Nir Elias Hoping to curb the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, Israel began administering the booster to its older population a month ago and has been gradually lowering the age of eligibility. It stood at 30 before Sunday's announcement. So far 2 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses. ""There are already results: the increase in severe morbidity has begun to slow,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement. ""But we have to complete third doses for all of our citizens. I call on those aged 12 and up to go out and immediately take the third shot."" Israel and other countries have pressed ahead with booster plans despite opposition from the World Health Organization, which said more of the world should be vaccinated with a first dose before people receive a third. The United States has said it will offer booster doses to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have also planned booster campaigns.

Fauci backs COVID-19 vaccine mandate for U.S. school children,1979,"WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said on Sunday he supports COVID-19 vaccine mandates for children attending schools as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to fuel a surge in cases in the nation. ""I believe that mandating vaccines for children to appear in school is a good idea,"" Fauci told CNN’s ""State of the Union"" program. ""We've done this for decades and decades, requiring polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis"" vaccinations. Currently, children under 12 are not eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. But Fauci, in a separate interview on ABC's ""This Week"" program, said there should be enough data by early October for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to consider whether the shot is safe for children under that age. ""I think there's a reasonable chance"" that the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) or Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines could get FDA clearance for kids under 12 before the upcoming holiday season, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said last Tuesday. As schools re-open for the fall, the rise in coronavirus cases is already causing significant disruptions. Dozens of schools nationwide have had to delay the start of the school year or shut down since opening in August, according to data from tracking website Burbio. Its data shows the impact on schools so far has been heaviest in the South, the epicenter of the current surge in cases and where vaccination rates among those already eligible are generally the lowest in the country. The re-opening of schools is also contributing to a supply shortage of COVID-19 tests in the United States as schools revive surveillance programs that will require tens of millions of tests, according to industry executives and state health officials, Reuters reported last week.

"Thousands protest in Berlin against COVID curbs, vaccines",2976,"BERLIN, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Several thousand people marched through the streets of Berlin on Sunday for a second day of unauthorised protest against coronavirus vaccinations and restrictions aimed at curbing a fourth wave of the pandemic. Shouting ""Hands off our children"", the protesters waved signs decrying what they called ""vaccination apartheid"" as parts of Germany consider imposing tougher restrictions on people who are not vaccinated against coronavirus. Dozens of police dressed in riot gear sought to control the march through residential streets in eastern Berlin. Berlin police said on Twitter it had detained about 80 people at the demonstration, with a focus on violent people or those calling for violations of coronavirus regulations. On Saturday, police detained more than 100 people at a similar demonstration after the marchers tried to get through barricades to the government quarter in central Berlin. About 60% of the German population has now been fully vaccinated and about 65% have had at least one shot, but infections are rising rapidly again, prompting officials to consider ways to encourage more people to get protected. With a significant minority in Germany sceptical about vaccination, the government in the city of Berlin has come under fire for exhorting teenagers to get the shots, which are authorised for those over the age of 12. At least one region in Germany is planning to impose tougher restrictions on people who are not vaccinated, an official was quoted as saying on Sunday. The German government currently requires people to be vaccinated, test negative or have a recovery certificate to enter indoor restaurants, visit hospitals and nursing homes and attend events, parties or do sports indoors. The southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg's social ministry has proposed banning unvaccinated adults from restaurants and concerts altogether, and restricting their contacts. ""If it hits the intensive care units, we have to act,"" Thomas Strobl, Baden-Wuerttemberg's deputy leader, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""It would be wrong to hold everyone jointly liable, including the vaccinated. That's why there will be different rules for the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated."" The health minister in neighbouring Bavaria also supports the proposals, the paper said. The leading candidates vying to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel in a federal election on Sept. 26 have pledged there will be no return to the strict lockdowns of last year and earlier this year even as coronavirus infections jump again. The country reported 8,416 new cases on Sunday and 12 fatalities, bringing the total number of cases to more than 3.9 million and the death toll to 92,130. To nudge more people to get vaccinated, the government has said it will stop offering free coronavirus tests from Oct. 11, except for those for whom vaccination is not recommended, such as children and pregnant women.

U.S. Gulf Coast residents flee 'extremely dangerous' Hurricane Ida,4569,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida intensified over warm Gulf of Mexico waters on Saturday, prompting tens of thousands to flee coastal areas, while President Joe Biden pledged aid to help states quickly recover once the storm has passed. Forecasters said Ida could make a U.S. landfall on Sunday night as an ""extremely dangerous"" Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, generating winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph), heavy downpours and a tidal surge that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline under several feet of water. On Saturday evening Ida was about 200 miles (320 km) southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, packing top winds of 105 miles per hour (169 kph) and aiming for the Louisiana coast, the National Hurricane Center said. ""We're concerned about explosive development shortly before it makes landfall,"" said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, which provides weather advice to oil and transportation companies. Flooding from Ida's storm surge - high water driven by the hurricane's winds - could reach between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 4.5 meters) around the mouth of the Mississippi River, with lower levels extending east along the adjacent coastlines of Mississippi and Alabama, the NHC said. Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled the seashore. ""I left Fourchon last night at 8 o'clock and it's a ghost town,"" said Andre LeBlanc, a sportfishing captain speaking from his inland home in Lafayette, Louisiana. “We were some of the last to get out of there.” POWER OUTAGES EXPECTED Utilities were bringing in extra crews and equipment to deal with expected power losses. Hundreds of thousands of homes could fall dark as Ida's strong winds carry well into Louisiana and as far east at Mobile, Alabama, said DTN's Foerster. Biden on Saturday said 500 federal emergency response workers were in Texas and Louisiana to respond to the storm. Aid workers have ""closely coordinated with the electric utilities to restore power as soon as possible,"" Biden said at a briefing with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. read more Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state is already reeling from a public health crisis stemming from a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ida's winds will be fierce and spread across a 300-mile area.

""This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in the state of Louisiana since at least the 1850s."" The state is not planning to evacuate hospitals now strained by an influx of COVID-19 patients, he said. There were more than 3,400 new infections reported on Friday, and about 2,700 people are hospitalized with the virus. ""We have been talking to hospitals to make sure that their generators are working, that they have way more water on hand than normal, that they have PPE on hand,"" Edwards said.

"As recall looms, California governor aims to galvanize Democrats",6033,"SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug 29 (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom and his supporters are stepping up their fight against a Republican-backed recall with a barrage of door knocks, text messages and outreach to communities of color as opinion polls show the Democrat in danger of losing. The group Voto Latino exclusively told Reuters it plans to spend about $1 million ahead of the Sept. 14 recall vote to try to persuade 600,000 young Latinos to cast ballots for Newsom, highlighting his need to spur more enthusiasm among Black and Latino voters. Democrats outnumber Republicans in California more than two-to-one. President Joe Biden won the state by nearly 30 percentage points last year. Half of the state's registered voters and 91% of Democrats said in a July 27 poll by the University of California, Berkeley, Institute for Governmental Studies that they want to retain the first-term governor. But a perfect storm of issues energizing Republicans - and complacency among Democrats who think the governor has it in the bag - has the recall election looking much closer than expected. Like Democrats across the country, Newsom has taken heat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from opponents of public health shutdowns, mask mandates and school closures. He also is grappling with a rise in cases of homelessness and homicides, extreme drought and devastating wildfires. A successful recall would serve as a wake-up call for Democrats already facing the threat of losing their majorities in Congress in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, said Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio. Maviglio served as press secretary for Democrat Gray Davis, ousted as California's governor by Hollywood action star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the state's last recall in 2003. Maviglio said Democrats must take the election seriously to avoid the same fate for Newsom, a former lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco. ""Democrats need a slap in the face to get off the sofa and fill out that form,"" he said. TURNOUT KEY The Patriot Coalition, a group angered by Newsom's policies on immigration and crime, spearheaded the effort to remove him. Their campaign gained steam as frustration mounted over Newsom's pandemic policies and a judge granted them extra time to get enough signatures to put the recall on a ballot. Voters will be asked to make two separate decisions - whether Newsom should be removed, and who should replace him. If Newsom is recalled, he will almost certainly be succeeded by a Republican with comparatively little statewide support. The winner needs only a plurality of votes to become governor, and just one little-known Democrat is among the replacement choices. Conservative talk show host Larry Elder leads recent polls, followed by businessman John Cox and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. Newsom goes into the final weeks of the race with a war chest of more than $51 million, campaign finance records show, compared to about $6 million for those seeking to unseat him. Keenly aware that turnout could decide the special election, Newsom's team is rolling out new daily messages predicting dire consequences for Democratic priorities such as abortion rights, immigration and other issues if he is removed from office. A Friday rally with Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, was canceled after a deadly attack outside the Kabul airport killed dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. ""There are no swing voters in this election,"" said Newsom adviser Nathan Click. ""There's no one who's choosing between yes and no. The 'swing voters' are all Democrats who are choosing between voting and not voting."" Just 36% of registered voters told pollsters at the University of California, Berkeley, last month that they favored removing the governor, with 51% opposed. But when researchers dug deeper, they found that very few Democrats were planning to vote - making the race exceedingly close with 47% of the most likely voters favoring the recall and 50% opposed. ""What we found was an astounding gap between likely and registered voters,"" said Eric Schickler, co-director of the institute that conducted the poll. The state sent mail-in ballots to all Californians who are registered to vote. Data released last week showed Democrats had returned their ballots by a rate of two-to-one compared to Republicans, buoying Democrats' hopes that their voters were beginning to understand the stakes. But analyst Paul Mitchell, whose firm Political Data studied the returns, said the early results could reflect Republicans' skepticism of voting by mail rather than heightened Democratic interest in the recall. Former President Donald Trump's repeated false accusations that mail-in voting was rife with fraud caused a shift in voting tendencies among Republicans that others in his party are now trying to counter. Political strategist Matt Shupe, the Republican Party chairman for Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he sent 35,000 text messages last week to members urging them to return their ballots. ""They need to not be worried, and they need to go and mail in the ballots,"" he said. Most of the ballots cast so far came from white voters, Mitchell's analysis found. Newsom also needs to persuade voters in communities of color to turn out if he wants to keep his job. Groups including the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project; Black Women for Wellness; the Chinese Progressive Association Action Fund; and the immigrant rights group CHIRLA are planning get-out-the-vote activities such as canvassing and phone banks. Voto Latino, which targets voters ages 18 to 34, has sent out text messages and digital advertisements urging people to vote, said Ameer Patel, vice president of programs. In coming days, he said, the messages will take on a more urgent tone, warning that voting rights, immigration and climate could be impacted if Newsom is replaced by a Republican.

India's Bharat Biotech scouts international COVID-19 vaccine partners,1450,"NEW DELHI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech is seeking international manufacturing partners as it targets a billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine each year, the company said on Sunday. COVAXIN, the company's home-grown COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in India, is one of two shots driving the country's massive vaccination programme. But Bharat Biotech has struggled to boost output, missing supply commitments to the Indian government, which is also relying on a version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. On Sunday, the company rolled out the first batch of COVAXIN shots from a facility in Ankleshwar in western India that has the capacity to produce more than 10 million doses per month. Bharat Biotech said it was exploring opportunities with its international partners who have expertise in commercial-scale manufacturing of inactivated viral vaccines. ""We want to ensure that Bharat Biotech can ably meet the demand for COVAXIN such that individuals across the country, and the globe, have access to the vaccine,"" chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said in a statement. Last month, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya told parliament that Bharat Biotech would supply 25 million doses in July and 35 million in August, less than half what the government had initially expected.

Japan eyes mixed use of COVID-19 shots to speed vaccine rollout,1415,"TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Japan is looking into the possibility of mixing shots of AstraZeneca Plc's (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine with those developed by other drug makers in a bid to speed up its vaccine rollout, the minister in charge of vaccinations said on Sunday. Japan, which has previously relied on the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) vaccines, approved AstraZeneca's vaccine in July and has secured two million doses. ""I have asked the health ministry to come up with an opinion about the use of AstraZeneca vaccines for the first dose and Pfizer's with the second, or the AstraZeneca's as the first shot and Moderna as second,"" vaccine programme chief Taro Kono said on the Fuji Television network. This could speed up the vaccination rollout by shortening the intervals between the first and second shots when using the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said. AstraZeneca's two shots are administered with an interval of eight weeks, longer than for the other vaccines. Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time. The country's vaccination ratio has lagged other developed nations. Japan has inoculated 54% of its population with at least one dose and fully vaccinated 43%, according to a Reuters vaccine tracker. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Yemen gets first batch of J&J COVID-19 vaccines,1201,"ADEN, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Yemen received its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Sunday, roughly 151,000 doses, the health ministry said. The desperately poor country, where health infrastructure has been devastated by six years of war, received 360,000 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine in March through COVAX. This shipment is the first batch of a total of 504,000 doses it is set to receive from the United States. The single-dose vaccines arrived as the United Nations warned early this month that Yemen, where only roughly 1% of the population is vaccinated, faces a third wave of COVID-19. The disease has killed 1,450 people in areas controlled by the internationally-recognised government of Yemen based in Aden, out of a total 7,751 recorded infections. The Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which is at war with the Aden-based government and controls the capital Sanaa as well as major cities in the north and west, has only announced four infections in areas it controls and one death of a Somali immigrant in April 2020.

World number three Stefanos Tsitsipas, who will face the unseeded Murray in the first round on Monday, has said he is wary of getting vaccinated and will only do so if it becomes mandatory to compete on the ATP Tour. read more But 20-time Grand Slam winners Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal feel athletes need to play their part and get vaccinated. Murray said players may be persuaded when they see the freedom that vaccinated players have compared to unvaccinated competitors at tournaments such as January's Australian Open. ""I know the conversations with regards to the Australian Open and stuff are already happening,"" Murray said. ""The players that have been vaccinated are going to potentially be able to ... have very different conditions to players who are not vaccinated."" Murray said he believes ""a lot"" of the tour is not vaccinated and said that if tournaments begin to require it in order to compete, it will spark controversy. ""There's going to have to be a lot of pretty long, hard conversations with the tour and all of the players involved to try and come to a solution,"" he said.

Taliban prepare to form new cabinet as U.S. evacuation nears end,2537,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Saturday they were preparing a new cabinet as the U.S. evacuation nears its end and they expected that sharp currency falls and economic turmoil following their takeover of Kabul two weeks ago would subside. Zabihullah Mujahid, the movement's main spokesman, made the comments to Reuters as the U.S. military winds down its mission to evacuate U.S. citizens and vulnerable Afghans and withdraw troops from Kabul airport ahead of the Aug. 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden. Mujahid condemned an overnight U.S. drone strike against Islamic State militants following Thursday's suicide attack near the airport as a ""clear attack on Afghan territory"". But he appealed to the United States and other Western nations to maintain diplomatic relations after their withdrawal, which he expected would be completed ""very soon"". The exact timing of the formation of a new cabinet remained unclear. Reuters originally quoted Mujahid as saying the announcement would be made in the coming week, but in a voice message later he said the makeup of the new cabinet would be cleared ""in one or two weeks"". Responding to a question about whether any women would be included in the new cabinet, he said this would be a matter for the leadership to decide and he could not anticipate what their decision would be. There is mounting frustration in Kabul at the severe economic hardship caused by a plummeting currency and rising food prices, with banks still shuttered two weeks after the fall of the city to the Taliban. On Saturday, a statement from the Taliban said that banks were ordered to reopen with a weekly limit on withdrawals of $200 or 20,000 afghanis. Mujahid said officials had already been appointed to run key institutions including the ministries of public health and education and the central bank. United Nations officials have warned that Afghanistan faces a humanitarian catastrophe, with large parts of the country suffering from extreme drought conditions. The economy, shattered after four decades of war, also faces the loss of billions of dollars in foreign aid, following the withdrawal of Western embassies from the country. Mujahid said the economic problems being experienced would be eased once the new government was in place. ""The fall of Afghani against foreign currency is temporary and it is because of the situation that suddenly changed, it will come back to normal once the government system starts functioning,"" he said.

Cuba to deploy China's Sinopharm alongside homegrown vaccines,3388,"HAVANA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Cuba, which to date had deployed exclusively its homegrown COVID-19 vaccines, will start also using the Sinopharm vaccine of its Communist-run ally China in its bid to battle one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world. Health authorities will apply two doses of Sinopharm combined with a Cuban booster in the central province of Cienfuegos from Sunday, Vicente Verez, the head of the Cuban Finlay Vaccine Institute, was cited as saying by the provincial state-run outlet 5deSeptiembre. The efficacy of the vaccine combo is above 90%, according to the outlet, without detailing where the data came from or whether Cuba's drug regulator had authorized the use of the Chinese vaccine. The World Health Organization gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm shot in May. Authorities who had said earlier this month they would be able to produce enough vaccines for all of Cuba by September did not explain why they were choosing to deploy a foreign one now. ""It seems obvious the decision to apply Sinopharm in Cienfuegos is associated to the limited availability of Cuban vaccines and the urgency caused by the explosion of cases,"" said Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol. The health ministry had said in May the plan was to have vaccinated 70% of the population by August but had so far only reached around 30%, said Perez Riverol, who has become a guru on Cuban COVID-19 data analysis, on Facebook. Meanwhile, Cuba has one of the highest COVID-19 caseloads in the world which is overwhelming its vaunted healthcare system which is heavily focused on prevention and primary care. The outbreak comes amid a shortage of basic goods including medicine that has fueled anger at the government, leading to unprecedented nationwide protests last month. Cuban authorities, which blame the economic crisis largely on a tightening of U.S. sanctions, have hailed donations of medical gear and food since the protests from allies like China although it was unclear if the vaccines were donated or bought. TOO LATE? Government critics had long urged it to acquire foreign vaccines rather than simply relying on homegrown ones, accusing it of placing its desire for prestige and good publicity over health concerns. Authorities said they preferred to focus scant resources on vaccine development and production than imports. U.S. President Joe Biden said last month the United States was prepared to send vaccines to Cuba if it was assured an international organization would administer them. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel retorted that if the United States cared about the island's humanitarian situation, it would lift the U.S. sanctions they accuse amongst other things of slowing down production of its homegrown vaccines. The country has developed an unusually large biotech sector for a country its size, partly in a bid for sovereignty given the decades-old crippling U.S. trade embargo. It is the only Latin American country to have completed the development of two COVID-19 vaccines, Soberana 2 and Abdala, which have elicited interest from nations worldwide from Jamaica and Mexico to Vietnam and Argentina. It says the three shot vaccines both have efficacy of over 90% although the data has not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. It has authorized both for emergency use.

U.S. Open unfolds amid a new era for players' mental health,3074,"NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Players' mental health is in focus as the U.S. Open kicks off Monday, after four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka led the charge for her fellow athletes this year. The 23-year-old withdrew from the French Open after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to attend media conferences, which she said had an adverse impact on her mental health, and disclosed she had suffered from depression for years. The incident led Roland-Garros organisers to concede that the sport's governing bodies needed to do better and the United States Tennis Association (USTA) this week announced a mental health initiative for players in partnership with the Mount Sinai Health System. read more ""Sports psychology has always been in the realm of, 'how do we optimize on the court?' but there's so many reasons for why athletes are impacted after competition,"" Shannon O’Neill, PhD, a psychologist at Mount Sinai West, told Reuters. ""Really promoting a well-rounded person who is multifaceted, not just an athlete... I think is really critical in the therapeutic process."" A broader conversation on mental health in sport has unfolded since Roland-Garros, with four-time Rio Olympic champion Simone Biles withdrawing from several gymnastics events at the Tokyo Games, citing the need to focus on her mental health and drawing worldwide support. At Flushing Meadows this week, world number two Aryna Sabalenka told reporters working with a psychologist had paid dividends on and off the court. She previously credited therapy with helping her handle the pressure of Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-final in the best major performance of her career. ""Knowing that I have someone who's going to help me whenever I need it... it's definitely help,"" she said. ""One time at night I couldn't sleep because I was overthinking about everything. I just call her and I spoke with her... After that I felt much better."" Moving swiftly to give athletes more support is imperative for sport's governing bodies, Bob Dorfman, the creative director at Baker Street Advertising, told Reuters, with the issue still top of mind. ""The mental health of athletes had never really been a major concern until Naomi Osaka bravely made it public, and Simone Biles courageously kept it front and center,"" he said. ""It’s admirable that the U.S. Open is putting forward initiatives in this regard, but it can’t be mere lip service or temporary. ""Action must be sincere, ongoing and well-funded. Anything less will ring phony."" The Women's Tennis Association (WTA), for its part, joined forces with seven-time Grand Slam winner Venus Williams, partnering with mental health services company BetterHelp for a $2 million ""free therapy giveaway."" ""We need to create an accepting and open environment to seek professional mental health therapy,"" said Williams.

Number of French COVID-19 intensive care patients drops,869,"PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The number of people in French hospital intensive care units due to COVID-19 dipped on Saturday for the first time in nine days, dropping by 11 to 2,259 in total. Since July 21, the number of patients in critical care had risen continuously, bar a small drop on Aug. 19. This period of rising ICU numbers coincided with a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections, according to the French government. Vaccinations have picked across France, where the government has also introduced a health pass or official documentation proving that a person has had the vaccine in order to enter restaurants, bars, museums and sports venues. Thousands of people demonstrated in France on Saturday against the health pass for the seventh weekend in a row, although a majority of French people are now vaccinated.

"Sudan receives over 200,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from France",1506,"KHARTOUM, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Sudan has received a shipment of 218,400 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a donation from France, the health ministry and UNICEF said. The vaccines were delivered with UNICEF's support through the COVAX facility, they said in separate statements on Friday. In March, Sudan received an initial 820,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine made by AstraZeneca in March through COVAX and UNICEF. It also received 606,700 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines as a donation from the United States earlier in August. China also had donated quantities of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine. More than 800,000 people in Sudan including health workers have been vaccinated since March 2021 with the first COVAX shipment and other donations, UNICEF said on Friday. Most have taken only one dose, and the new shipment will contribute to an increase in the number of people who are fully vaccinated, it added. ""The vaccinations come at a critical time as the infection numbers are climbing while the country is preparing to re-open schools after three years of numerous interruptions,"" the statement said. Sudan, with a population of 42 million, will start a second vaccination campaign in some states on Sunday after receiving new vaccines batches, the health ministry said.

Modi hails India's 10 mln COVID vaccine doses in a single day,2021,"NEW DELHI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - India administered more than 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses on Friday, a national record that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed as a ""momentous feat"" for the country ahead of fears of another surge in infections. India has now administered about 628 million vaccine doses in total, giving at least one dose to more than half of its 944 million adults and the required two doses to 15%. The government wants the entire adult population covered by December. ""Record vaccination numbers today!"" Modi said on Twitter. ""Crossing 1 crore (10 million) is a momentous feat."" The previous daily record was 9.2 million. India's vaccine production has jumped this month, thanks mainly to the Serum Institute of India that is now making about 150 million doses a month of its version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine. The sharp rise in vaccinations came as India reported more than 40,000 new infections for a second consecutive day on Friday. Cases had fallen to a five-month-low of 25,166 in the middle of the month but have risen sharply in the last three days, mainly in the southern state of Kerala which recently held a large festival during which families typically come together. India reported 44,658 new COVID-19 infections on Friday, taking the total to 32.6 million, the most in the world after the United States. The death toll rose by 496 to 436,861. Kerala has accounted for nearly 60% of the new coronavirus cases in the past week and more than half of the total active cases, followed by 16% in the western state of Maharashtra. ""Any laxity in ensuring a strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and ensuring COVID appropriate behaviour, may result in a further surge in COVID-19 transmission in Kerala and its neighbouring states,"" the health ministry told the Kerala state government in a letter shared with journalists. Kerala said it would impose a lockdown on Sundays until further orders. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Two die in Japan after shots from suspended Moderna vaccines - Japan govt,2368,"TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Two people died after receiving Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine shots that were among lots later suspended following the discovery of contaminants, Japan's health ministry said on Saturday. The men in their 30s died this month within days of receiving their second Moderna doses, the ministry said in a release. Each had a shot from one of three manufacturing lots suspended on Thursday. The causes of death are being investigated. Japan halted the use of 1.63 million Moderna doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide, more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T), received reports of contaminants in some vials. read more ""At this time, we do not have any evidence that these deaths are caused by the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,"" Moderna and Takeda said in a statement on Saturday. ""It is important to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether there is any connection."" The government has also said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and the suspension of the three Moderna batches was a precaution. Fumie Sakamoto, the infection control manager at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, cautioned against drawing a connection between the shots and the fatalities reported on Saturday. ""There may only be a temporal relationship between vaccination and death,"" Sakamoto told Reuters. ""There are so many things we still don't know to make any conclusions on these two cases."" The contaminants found in some vials in Japan are believed to be metallic particles, public broadcaster NHK reported, citing health ministry sources. Japan has administered more than 124 million COVID-19 vaccine shots, with about 44% of the population fully inoculated. As of Aug. 8, 991 people had died in Japan after receiving shots of Pfizer Inc's vaccine and 11 after receiving Moderna's, but no causality between the injections and the deaths has been established, according to the health ministry. Adverse reactions have been reported at a frequency of 0.01% for the Moderna shot. In the fatalities reported on Saturday, each man had a fever the day after his second dose and died two days after getting the fever. There has been no evidence that their shots contained contaminants, a health ministry official told reporters. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Australia logs record COVID-19 cases, driven by New South Wales",2407,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Australia reported a record 1,126 coronavirus infectious on Saturday, the vast majority in New South Wales, the epicentre of the Delta-fuelled outbreak. More than half of Australians have been in weeks-long lockdowns as officials in Sydney and Melbourne, the country's largest cities, and the capital Canberra struggle to quell the outbreak. New South Wales, the most populous state and home to Sydney, reported 1,035 locally acquired COVID-19 infections, breaking Thursday's record of 1,029 as the outbreak that started in mid-June continues to grow. Victoria reported 64 cases, mostly in its capital Melbourne, and Australian Capital Territory that includes Canberra had 26 infections. Queensland had one, Australia's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told a briefing. Despite the record in New South Wales, the state's conservative Liberal Party government said it would ease some restrictions next week, allowing for five-guest weddings. The state's management of the outbreak - which has nearly 14,700 active cases - has been criticised by officials in neighbouring Victoria, who have imposed stricter restrictions, believing the outbreak there can be suppressed. ""I'm not sure 1,000 cases a day is a sign of hope,"" Victoria's Health Minister Martin Foley said of the New South Wales infections. ""I'm pretty sure that if you ask those intensive care nurses in Sydney hospitals at the moment how they saw the situation, it wouldn't be a hugely rosy picture."" After months of supply delays with the Pfizer shots and public unease about the AstraZeneca vaccine, Australia has been racing in recent weeks to inoculate its population. At current rates, 80% could be vaccinated by mid-November. The federal government announced a plan last month that envisaged lockdowns as a key to quelling outbreaks until 70% percent of the population gets vaccinated and a gradual re-opening of Australia's borders when the number reaches 80%. Just 33.7% of people above age 16 have been fully vaccinated, but with some 49,800 cases and 993 deaths, Australia has kept its COVID-19 numbers relatively low. Neighbouring New Zealand, which had been largely virus-free this year, is also fighting a Delta outbreak, reporting 82 new locally acquired cases on Saturday, all in the epicentre Auckland, as the nation remains under a strict lockdown.

Philippines' Duterte extends coronavirus curbs as cases hit new record high,2570,"MANILA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has lengthened coronavirus restrictions in the capital region and some provinces, his spokesperson said on Saturday, as the Southeast Asian nation logged a new record in daily COVID-19 infections. The Philippines, which has among the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia, is battling a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases driven by community transmission of the more infectious Delta variant. ""We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a public briefing. The health ministry recorded 19,441 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, notching a record-high for the third time in the past nine days. Total confirmed cases have risen to more than 1.93 million, while deaths have reached 33,008, after 167 more fatalities were recorded. Active cases, at 142,679, were at a four-month high, overwhelming hospitals and healthcare workers in coronavirus hotspots, health ministry data show. ""Improving vaccination coverage, shortening the duration of detection to isolation, and compliance of people to community healthcare standards would really help us stop the transmission in communities,"" Vergeire said. The government on Saturday extended the second-highest level of quarantine curbs in the capital region until Sept. 7. Although some businesses can operate at up to 50% on-site capacity, restaurant dine-in, personal care services and religious activities are still prohibited in the capital region, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement. The capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to more than 13 million people, is the country's coronavirus epicentre, accounting for a third of the 1.91 million confirmed infections and a quarter of the 32,841 total deaths. Nine provinces and six cities facing a surge in cases and high healthcare utilisation were also placed under the second-tightest coronavirus curbs. The government is pinning its hopes for an economic recovery on its inoculation programme, which started in March. The Philippines has so far secured a total of 194.89 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, enough to inoculate about 100.5 million Filipinos or more than 100% of the country's adult population, the finance ministry said. Nearly 49 million doses have been delivered, while another 42 million will arrive in a month, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, adding that the government could inoculate everyone by January.

U.S. Gulf Coast braces for Category 4 landfall of Hurricane Ida after Cuba takes hit,4563,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida battered Cuba with roof-ripping force on Friday as it churned toward a weekend U.S. landfall along the Louisiana coast, prompting evacuations of flood-prone New Orleans neighborhoods and oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. By late on Friday, Ida was packing sustained winds of up to 80 miles per hour (129 kph), according to the National Weather Service, which expected the storm to intensify significantly before coming ashore as a major hurricane in southeastern Louisiana on Sunday afternoon or evening. Forecasters said Ida would likely make U.S. landfall as a robust Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, generating steady winds nearing 140 mph, heavy downpours and a tidal surge expected to plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline under several feet of water. Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - will likely reach between 10 and 15 feet around the mouth of the Mississippi River, with lower levels extending east along the adjacent coastlines of Mississippi and Alabama, according to the National Hurricane Center. Scattered tornadoes, widespread power outages and inland flooding from torrential rain across the region were also expected. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, his state already reeling from a public health crisis stemming from a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, urged residents to ready themselves for the hurricane immediately. ""Now is the time to finish your preparations,"" he told a Friday afternoon news conference. ""By nightfall tomorrow night, you need to be where you intend to ride out the storm."" New Orleans officials ordered residents to evacuate communities outside the city's levee system, and posted voluntary evacuation notices for the rest of the parish. Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome signed an emergency disaster declaration and said the city had pre-positioned sand and sandbags at eight strategic locations as part of storm preparations. Lifelong Gulf resident Hailey DeLaune, 29, told Reuters she and her fiance spent Friday evening boarding up the windows of his house in Gulfport, Mississippi, and gathering provisions to ride out the storm.

NOAA/via REUTERS ""Hurricanes have always been part of my life,"" said the high school theology teacher, who was born during 1992's Category 5 Hurricane Andrew. ""You just run through your list and hope for the best."" Edwards declared a state of emergency on Thursday, and on Friday U.S. President Joe Biden issued a pre-landfall federal emergency declaration at Edwards' request. It authorized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state. Edwards also said he had authorized activation of all 5,000 troops in the Louisiana National Guard for emergency deployments as needed. U.S. energy companies racing to complete evacuations of offshore platforms in the Gulf ahead of the storm had reduced petroleum production by nearly 60% and gas output by almost half, federal regulators said. read more CARIBBEAN TAKES FIRST HIT Soon after being upgraded from tropical storm to hurricane status, Ida smashed into Cuba's small Isle of Youth, off the southwestern end of the Caribbean island nation, toppling trees and tearing roofs from dwellings. The streets of Havana, the capital, were empty as residents shuttered themselves at home ahead of Ida's arrival, which government forecasters warned could bring storm surges to Cuba's western coastline. Jamaica was flooded by heavy rains, and there were landslides after the passage of the storm. Many roads were impassable, forcing some residents to abandon their homes. Ida, the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, may well exceed the strength of Hurricane Laura, the last Category 4 storm to strike Louisiana, by the time it makes landfall, forecasters said. But it pales in comparison to Katrina, the monster Category 5 storm that devastated the region in August 2005, claiming more than 1,800 lives. Officials in U.S. coastal areas preparing for the storm urged residents to move boats out of harbors and encouraged early evacuations. Officials in Louisiana's Lafourche Parish said they would enact a voluntary evacuation, especially for people in low-lying areas, mobile homes and RVs.

U.S. intelligence community says cannot solve COVID mystery without China,5138,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. intelligence community does not believe it can resolve a debate over whether a Chinese laboratory incident was the source of COVID-19 without more information, U.S. officials said in a declassified summary on Friday. U.S. officials said only China can help solve questions about the true origins of the virus that has now killed 4.6 million people worldwide. ""China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19,"" they said. President Joe Biden, who received a classified report this week summarizing the investigation he ordered, said Washington and its allies will continue to press China for answers. ""Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People's Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it,"" Biden said in a statement after the summary was released. The summary, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is set to worsen discord between Beijing and Washington at a time when ties are at their lowest point in decades. In the United States, activists worried the investigation could also encourage violence against Asian Americans. China's embassy in Washington issued a statement saying the report ""wrongly"" claimed that China continued to hinder the investigation and added that ""a report fabricated by the U.S. intelligence community is not scientifically credible."" ""The origin-tracing is a matter of science; it should and can only be left to scientists, not intelligence experts,"" it said. The embassy charged that the report was aimed at ""scapegoating China,"" an approach that would ""disturb and sabotage international cooperation on origin-tracing and on fighting the pandemic."" The statement also charged that Washington ""has been shying away from tracing the origin in the United States and closing the door on any such possibility."" China has ridiculed a theory that coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where COVID-19 infections emerged in late 2019, setting off the pandemic, and has pushed fringe theories including that it slipped out of a lab at the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick base in Maryland in 2019. The embassy statement suggested the United States should invite World Health Organization experts to Fort Detrick to investigate. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said the report ""underscores the need for China to stop stonewalling international investigations into a global pandemic that has cost so many lives and livelihoods around the world."" He also urged Americans to denounce ""hateful rhetoric and discrimination"" against Asian Americans. The U.S. report revealed new details about the extent of the disagreement within the Biden administration over the lab-leak theory. Several organizations within the sprawling U.S. intelligence community thought the novel coronavirus emerged from ""natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus,"" according to the summary. But they had only ""low confidence"" in that conclusion, it said. Other groups were not able to come to any firm opinion at all on the origins. One intelligence community segment, however, developed ""moderate confidence"" the first human infection with COVID-19 was likely due to a ""laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" A WHO-led team that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February dismissed that theory. But their March report, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists, has been faulted for using insufficient evidence in doing so. read more The new U.S. report concluded that analysts would not be able to provide ""a more definitive explanation"" without new information from China, such as clinical samples and epidemiological data about the earliest cases. Initially, U.S. spy agencies strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But people familiar with intelligence reporting have said there has been little corroboration over recent months the virus had spread widely and naturally among wild animals. ""While this review has concluded, our efforts to understand the origins of this pandemic will not rest,"" Biden said. ""We will do everything we can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again."" The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new committee to develop next steps on studying the virus SARS-CoV-2. But epidemiological experts said the window was closing for any useful data to be collected, particularly from people infected by the disease in 2019, when the virus likely first emerged.

U.S. on alert for further Kabul attacks in race to complete evacuations,6627,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. forces helping evacuate Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule were on alert for more attacks on Friday after an Islamic State suicide bombing outside Kabul airport killed at least 92 people, including 13 U.S. service members. The White House said the next few days of an ongoing U.S. evacuation operation that the Pentagon said has taken about 111,000 people out of Afghanistan in the past two weeks are likely to be the most dangerous. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the United States believes there are still ""specific, credible"" threats against the airport after the bombing at one of its gates. ""We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts,"" Kirby told reporters in Washington. ""We're monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real time."" (Graphic: Where bombers struck the Kabul International airport) U.S. and allied forces are racing to complete evacuations of their citizens and vulnerable Afghans and to withdraw from Afghanistan by an Aug. 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden after two decades of American military presence there. About 4,200 people were evacuated from Kabul during a 12-hour period on Friday, the White House said. Earlier in the day U.S. officials said a total of approximately 5,100 Americans had been evacuated, with about 500 more waiting to leave. While thousands have been evacuated, they are far outnumbered by those who could not get out. Some U.S. media including the New York Times cited local health officials as saying up to 170 people, not including the U.S. troops, were killed in Thursday's attack. Throngs of people have gathered outside the airport to try to get onto evacuation flights since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on Aug. 15. The attack was the deadliest incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a decade. Taliban forces have taken up positions in Kabul airport and are ready to take full control as early as this weekend, as soon as U.S. forces leave, two senior Taliban figures said. One senior commander said Taliban forces had taken over most of the airport, ""just not a small part where the Americans still are"". ""As soon as the Americans leave, they just have to give us the signal and we will then take over,"" a second Taliban official said. Kirby disputed the Taliban account, telling reporters that the military section of the airport remains under U.S. control. ""They are not in charge of any of the gates. They are not in charge of any of the airport operations. That is still under U.S. military control,"" Kirby said. Early on Saturday in Kabul, the U.S. Embassy warned that Americans should avoid traveling to the airport because of security threats, and those at the Abbey, East, North or Ministry of Interior gates should leave immediately. The United States expects some ongoing engagement with the Taliban will be necessary after the withdrawal to facilitate further evacuations, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The reality is, the Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan, including the areas surrounding the perimeter of the airport,"" she told reporters. ""So by necessity, that is our option.""

SINGLE SUICIDE BOMBER Islamic State (ISIS), an enemy of the Islamist Taliban as well as the West, has claimed responsibility for the attack, which the Pentagon said on Friday was carried out by one suicide bomber at an airport gate, not two as it earlier stated. The number of Afghans killed has risen to 79, a hospital official told Reuters on Friday, adding that more than 120 were wounded. A Taliban official said the dead included 28 Taliban members, although a spokesman later denied any such fighters had been killed. The attack underlined the realpolitik facing Western powers in Afghanistan: Engaging with Taliban forces who they have long fought may be their best chance to prevent the country becoming a breeding ground for Islamist militancy. The United Nations Security Council condemned the bombing as ""especially abhorrent"" for targeting civilians trying to flee the country. Biden said on Thursday he has ordered the Pentagon to plan how to strike ISIS-K, the Islamic State affiliate that claimed responsibility. Asked on Friday if Biden sought to capture and put on trial those responsible, Psaki said ""I think he made it clear yesterday that he does not want them to live on the earth anymore."" Biden was already facing strong criticism at home and abroad for the chaos surrounding the troop withdrawal and evacuations. As the Taliban rapidly advanced to Kabul amid the pullout, Afghanistan's Western-backed government and military collapsed. Biden has defended his decisions, saying the United States long ago achieved its rationale for invading the country in 2001. The U.S.-led invasion toppled the then-ruling Taliban, punishing them for harbouring al Qaeda militants who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States that year. Most of the more than 20 allied countries involved in airlifting Afghans and their own citizens out of Kabul said they had completed evacuations by Friday. The Taliban said that Afghans with valid documents would be able to travel freely in future at any time - comments aimed at calming fears that the movement planned harsh restrictions. Taliban guards blocked access to the airport on Friday, witnesses said. ""We had a flight but the situation is very tough and the roads are blocked,"" said one man on an approach road. Medical supplies will run out within days in Afghanistan, the World Health Organization said, adding that it hopes to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif with the help of Pakistan. Pakistani officials told Reuters that at the Torkham border crossing, Pakistani security forces had opened fire on a group of people trying to illegally enter Pakistan, adding that two Afghans were killed and two wounded. Up to half a million Afghans could flee their homeland by year-end, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said, appealing to all neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. There are also growing worries Afghans will face a humanitarian emergency with the coronavirus spreading and shortages of food and medical supplies looming. The Taliban have asked all women healthcare workers to return to work, a spokesman said, as trained and educated Afghans flee the country. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations hit eight-month high over 100,000",2905,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The number of coronavirus patients in U.S. hospitals has breached 100,000, the highest level in eight months, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, as a resurgence of COVID-19 spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant strains the nation's health care system. A total of 101,433 COVID patients were hospitalized, according to data published on Friday morning. U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations have more than doubled in the past month. Over the past week, more than 500 people with COVID were admitted to hospitals each hour on average, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The United States reached its all-time peak for hospitalizations on Jan. 14 when there were over 142,000 coronavirus-infected patients in hospital beds, according to HHS. As the vaccination campaign rapidly expanded in early 2021, hospitalizations fell and hit a 2021 low of 16,000 on in late June. However, COVID-19 admissions rose suddenly in July as the Delta variant became the dominant strain. The U.S. South is the epicenter of the latest outbreak but hospitalizations are rising nationwide.

The Delta variant, which is rapidly spreading among mostly the unvaccinated U.S. population, has also sent a record number of children to hospital. There are currently over 2,000 confirmed and suspected pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to HHS. Three states - California, Florida and Texas - amount to about 32% of the total confirmed and suspected pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States. Children currently make up about 2.3% of the nation's COVID-19 hospitalizations. Kids under 12 are not eligible to receive the vaccine.

U.N. chief says social fabric of Ethiopia being torn apart,1825,"UNITED NATIONS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the Security Council on Thursday that a conflict in Ethiopia has spread beyond the northern Tigray region and ""a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes."" Ethiopia has been embroiled in a conflict that flared nine months ago in Tigray and which has spread to other areas. The government has also struggled to contain other outbreaks of ethnic and political violence over land and resources. Gunmen killed at least 150 people last week in western Ethiopia in an attack by an armed group against local residents, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said on Thursday. read more ""Inflammatory rhetoric and ethnic profiling are tearing apart the social fabric of the country,"" Guterres told the 15-member Security Council. ""All parties must immediately end hostilities without preconditions and seize that opportunity to negotiate a lasting ceasefire."" The United States called out the Ethiopian government for not responding positively to proposals for negotiations and instead publicly calling for the mobilization of militia; the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for expanding its own military campaign into the Afar and Amhara regions; and neighboring Eritrean Defense Forces for re-entering Tigray. ""This is all gravely concerning to all of us. These developments are eroding the unity, the sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state,"" said Richard Mills, deputy U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

England gets ready for mass COVID inoculations for 12- to 15-year-olds,1965,"LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Britain's government said on Saturday it had told England's health service to get ready for a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged between 12 and 15 starting in September, if vaccination experts give the green light. A first vaccine dose has already been offered to all 16- and 17-year-olds in England as well as to 12- to 15-year-olds with specific underlying health conditions and those who live with someone who is immuno-suppressed. Britain has so far not followed the example of many other countries which have pressed ahead with widespread vaccinations for children younger than 16. On Friday, the White House said half of U.S. children aged 12 to 17 had received at least their first vaccination dose against COVID-19. Most children develop only mild or no symptoms from COVID-19, but they are able to spread the virus. Britain's health ministry said ""we need to be ready to hit the ground running and start those vaccinations as soon as possible"" if the government's vaccination advisers backed extending the programme to all 12- to 15-year-olds. The advisers are currently weighing up the possible harms and benefits of such an extension. However, British health regulators have already said that the Pfizer(PFE.N)/BioNTech(22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines are safe and effective for those aged between 12 and 17. England's health service will begin contracting providers to recruit and train staff to provide school-aged immunisations to ensure teams would be ready to start offering vaccinations in schools from early September, the health ministry said. Parental or carer consent would be sought before giving children vaccinations, it said. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over health policy. As in England, they are not currently offering COVID-19 vaccinations to all 12- to 15-year-olds. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: Biden's Supreme Court losses prompt more 'shadow docket' scrutiny,3966,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration was dealt a double blow by the conservative-majority Supreme Court this week, raising new questions about how the justices handle cases brought via an emergency process known as the ""shadow docket."" The court in recent years has increasingly made substantive decisions on major issues via the shadow docket, deciding quickly and sometimes late at night in a process that critics from across the ideological spectrum say lacks transparency. The administration of Biden's Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, did very well with the process, winning a wide majority of the cases it brought via emergency applications. Some experts attributed that to a court that has traditionally been deferential to the White House. This week's decisions have raised questions as to whether a Democratic president receives the same friendly reception from a court with a 6-3 conservative majority. ""What we are seeing are the consequences of a deeply conservative court, with the added travesties of the shadow docket,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal nonprofit based in Washington. The court in a decision on Thursday night ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions imposed by Biden's administration. That came two days after a Tuesday evening decision denying Biden's bid to rescind an immigration policy implemented by Trump that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico awaiting U.S. hearings. That decision requires the government to revive Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. In both cases the three liberals on the court dissented. Trump won 28 of the 41 cases his administration brought via the shadow docket, which his administration turned to at a much higher rate than those of both Republican President George Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama. The ""remain in Mexico"" request was the first request made by Biden, who faces a court with which he is ideologically out of sync. BREYER RAISES QUESTIONS In the evictions case, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer referenced some of the shadow docket criticism in his dissenting opinion. ""These questions call for considered decision-making informed by full briefing and argument. Their answers impact the health of millions,"" he wrote. The majority appeared to respond to Breyer in the unsigned ruling, saying the case had been ""thoroughly briefed"" and that the court had undertaken a ""careful review"" of the relevant court papers. Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law who is a critic of how the court has handled shadow docket cases, noted that the court did explain its evictions decision in an eight-page opinion. By contrast, the immigration case was resolved in a two-paragraph order. The eviction decision ""responded to at least some of the concerns,"" Vladeck said. But, he added, ""I still think decisions with implications as wide-ranging as the eviction moratorium would benefit from plenary review,"" meaning that the court would hear oral arguments and have more time to consider the case. But Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Ohio, said he believed the court handled both cases appropriately based on court precedent. In the evictions case, he added, the administration knew the court would likely find the moratorium was unlawful based on the justices' June decision that grudgingly allowed a previous version to remain in place. ""The CDC was on notice that the court would be very skeptical of a renewed moratorium, and made little effort to insulate the new order,"" Adler said. Last month, a Reuters analysis of emergency applications over the previous 12 months showed how certain litigants - most notably the Trump administration and religious entities - fared better than others."
Court denies challenge to wood-fired residential heater test standards,3501,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday denied the challenge of an industry association representing manufacturers of wood-fired residential heaters to an Obama-era rule updating how the Environmental Protection Agency audits air-pollution tests for the widely used heaters. A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied a petition by the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association (HPBA) that claimed a 2015 rule allowing for initial and audit pollution tests to be conducted at different laboratories was arbitrary and capricious under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The plaintiffs claimed testing results can vary drastically when changing laboratories and that the EPA failed to adequately justify its approach, but the panel concluded that the agency had addressed the group's concerns. Jack Goldman, HPBA's chief executive, said in a statement: ""This ruling means that the small business(es) that make up this industry are threatened by an unfair standard and we are enormously disappointed."" The association is represented by lawyers at Crowell & Moring. An EPA spokesperson referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, whose spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment. The 2015 rule updates a 1988 one that requires manufacturers to test at EPA-approved, private laboratories a representative heater for compliance with a CAA-mandated particulate matter limit. If the heater is compliant, the manufacturer receives a certification authorizing its sale. The update says that the audit tests, which are conducted randomlyand whose failure can lead to the suspension of a certification, can now be conducted at any of the EPA-accredited laboratories the agency selects rather than only the certifying laboratory, as was previously the case. The 2015 rule was spurred by lawsuits by New York, other states and green groups claiming the EPA had failed its nondiscretionary duty to update the standards. Wood-burning heaters, like wood stoves, heat hundreds of thousands of U.S. homes in the 11 states including New York and Alaska that filed an amici brief, that filing says. The states supported the EPA. The heaters emit various air pollutants including particulate matter, whose health effects range from shortness of breath to heart problems, according to the ruling. HPBA in a filing said a study it commissioned suggested tests for wood stoves, when conducted at different laboratories, led to wild variations in results. The variability would make it ""almost impossible"" for manufacturers to build products that would not fail an audit test, the association said. In Friday's ruling, U.S. Circuit Judge Nina Pillard said that the EPA's 2015 update was anchored in an adequate explanation for rejecting that data. Pillard was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Robert Wilkins. The case is Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Assoc v. EPA, et al, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Florida judge says governor cannot ban school districts from requiring masks,2291,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - A state judge on Friday ruled that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' administration cannot ban public school districts from requiring face masks to curb the spread of COVID-19, saying it overstepped its authority. The decision by 2nd Circuit Judge John Cooper marked an important turning point in the political tug-of-war between the Republican governor, who has said parents should decide if their child wears a mask in school, and several Florida school districts that defied the governor's order by requiring that masks be worn as children return to the classroom. Appearing by video at a Zoom hearing, the judge said the governor's administration overstepped its authority by issuing and seeking to enforce an order that prevented districts from mandating masks. ""The defendants do not have authority ... to a blanket mandatory ban against a face mask policy that does not provide a parental opt out. They simply do not have that authority,"" Cooper said. Ten of Florida's 67 school districts have imposed mask mandates with only a medical opt-out, the Tampa Bay Times reported. DeSantis' administration has threatened to withhold funding from those districts for imposing mandates, but the judge's injunction bars it from doing that. ""We will continue to defend the law and parent's rights in Florida, and will immediately appeal the ruling to the First District Court of Appeals, where we are confident we will prevail on the merits of the case,"" DeSantis told local TV station WPBF. Florida is one of several states where Republican governors have sought to prevent local governments and school districts from mandating masks. These governors have said that such rules infringe on personal liberty. Proponents of mask mandates have said the rules are necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases rise particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates, driven by the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant. The public health crisis has been especially acute in Florida, where more than 16,000 people currently are hospitalized with COVID-19, according to a Reuters tally.

U.S. resumes supply of Lilly's COVID-19 antibody combo to some states,1692,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Friday decided to resume the supply of Eli Lilly's (LLY.N) COVID-19 antibody cocktail to states where variants resistant to it are low, saying the therapy could work against the fast-spreading Delta variant based on lab studies. The Department of Health and Human Services narrowed the scope of authorization for the dual-antibody therapy, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, to states including Colorado, Connecticut and Illinois, Indiana. With the Delta variant becoming the dominant strain, the prevalence of variants resistant to the therapy is steadily decreasing, the agency said. Based on lab tests, the drugs administered together are expected to retain activity against the Delta variant, but not against Delta plus and variants first identified in Brazil, South Africa and Colombia, it said. The department had in June paused its distribution after the therapy failed to show effectiveness against the coronavirus variants that were first identified in Brazil and South Africa. read more The supply of standalone etesevimab to be paired with existing supply of bamlanivimab is also being resumed to some states. Regeneron's (REGN.O) antibody therapy REGEN-COV, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) and partner Vir Biotechnology's (VIR.O) sotrovimab may be used in all states, territories, and U.S. jurisdictions as they are likely to be effective against most variants including Delta, the agency said. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab, REGEN-COV and sotrovimab are authorized for use in people 12 years and above with mild-to-moderate infection and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Though the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday struck down the federal eviction moratorium imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, smaller-bore, state-level COVID mandates continued their winning streak in courts. Federal courts, in a pair of decisions this week, upheld the University of Massachusetts' requirement that students be vaccinated, and dismissed as moot a challenge to business closures ordered last year by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper in Boston on Friday dismissed a lawsuit filed by two UMass students. Both students had argued in a lawsuit last month that the mandate, which is subject to medical and religious exemptions, was arbitrary and unsupported by science. One of them, Cora Cluett, also argued that an administrator wrongly denied her an exemption after determining that her Roman Catholic faith did not support one. Casper said that the mandate was well supported, citing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. She also said that Cluett's challenge failed because she failed to allege that the religious exemption policy was applied in an unfair way. The students' lawyer, Ryan McLane of McLane & McLane, and a representative of the university did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Casper's decision came the day after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that a challenge by a Boston-area bar and videogame arcade to Baker's business closure rules last year was moot. Baker, like many other governors, ordered the closure of nonessential businesses pursuant to a state of emergency last year as COVID rapidly spread in the state. He subsequently issued an order with a phased reopening plan, in which different categories of businesses would be allowed to open at different times as the emergency eased. Bit Bar alleged in its lawsuit that the phased reopening plan was illegal because it placed arcades in a later reopening category than casinos. After the lawsuit was filed, the governor shifted arcades into the same reopening tier as casinos, and the state moved to dismiss as moot. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns agreed, and Bit Bar appealed. Baker has since ended the COVID state of emergency and lifted all restrictions, but the bar argued that the threat of future restrictions meant the case was not moot. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson disagreed, noting that the governor had said he was lifting the emergency largely because of widespread vaccination, not to avoid litigation. ""So as long as the executive issues an unconstitutional decree and then another decree revoking that decree, the First Circuit thinks that there should be no cost to that,"" Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group, a lawyer for Bit Bar, said in an email. ""The day that the executive does something that they don't like, they're going to be sorry that they gave such latitude to unilateral dictatorial powers to the government.""

"Cops, firefighters challenge Gainesville's 'odious' vaccine mandate",3881,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - More than 200 employees of Gainesville, Florida, have filed a lawsuit seeking to strike down the city's requirement that its workers receive COVID-19 vaccines or be fired, saying it violates their constitutional rights. The workers, represented by Seldon Childers of ChildersLaw, filed a complaint in state court on Thursday claiming that various less-intrusive alternatives to vaccinations exist, and that many city employees will simply quit or retire rather than be forced to get a vaccine. The Gainesville City Commission adopted the mandate on Aug. 5 requiring city employees and contractors to receive vaccines by Oct. 14 or face termination. But many of the plaintiffs have ""durable and robust natural immunities"" because they have already contracted COVID, according to the complaint, and masks and antibody treatments may be just as effective as vaccines at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. ""In its mad rush to solve an intractable problem not of the Plaintiffs’ making, the City has conceived an odious scheme to coerce the Plaintiffs into taking unwanted and unnecessary COVID vaccines by threatening their livelihoods, pensions and dreams,"" Childers wrote in the complaint. The plaintiffs say the mandate violates their constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and privacy and bodily integrity. Shelby Taylor, a spokeswoman for the city, said workers' health and safety was the city's top priority. ""The City has taken the steps necessary to achieve that priority and stand by that decision,"" Taylor said. Several U.S. cities and states have said they will require public workers to become vaccinated, including Chicago, San Diego, New York City and California, amid a surge in COVID cases and the recent approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But Thursday's lawsuit appears to be the first to challenge one of those mandates. The plaintiffs said requiring workers to get vaccines is unnecessary and not rationally related to the mandate's purpose of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Because the vaccines do not prevent transmission of the highly contagious Delta variant, vaccinating workers is not likely to reduce secondary infections, they said. And by mandating vaccines, the city is risking ""catastrophic collapse"" if a large number of employees quit or are fired, the plaintiffs said. The city agency that operates public utilities, for example, already had 10% fewer employees than needed as of late July, according to the complaint. And in a recent internal survey, nearly 60% of the agency's 150 employees said they would quit, retire, or accept termination if they were required to become vaccinated, the plaintiffs said. In addition to the constitutional claims, the plaintiffs said the mandate violates a Florida law barring government entities from requiring individuals to prove that they received COVID-19 vaccines ""to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the governmental entity’s operations in this state.""

NATO allies struggle to keep Kabul airport open for aid after withdrawal,3949,"GENEVA/ANKARA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - NATO allies are struggling to ensure that Afghanistan's main gateway, Kabul airport, remains open for urgently needed humanitarian aid flights next week when they end their evacuation airlifts and turn it over to the Taliban. The airport, a lifeline for tens of thousands of evacuees fleeing Taliban fighters in the past two weeks and for aid arriving to relieve the impact of drought and conflict, was hit by a deadly suicide bombing outside its gates on Thursday. Turkey said it was still talking to the Taliban about providing technical help to operate the airport after the Aug. 31 deadline for troops to leave Afghanistan but said the bombing underlined the need for a Turkish force to protect any experts deployed there. Turkey has not said whether the Taliban would accept such a condition, and President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday his country was ""not in a rush to start flights"" again to Kabul. But aid groups said there is an urgent need to maintain humanitarian deliveries to a country suffering its second drought in four years and where 18 million people, nearly half the population, depend on life-saving assistance. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Friday that U.S. and allied air traffic experts had assessed Kabul airport ""for capabilities that would support the resumption of commercial operations once we depart"" and that the United States was working with all parties ""to facilitate a smooth transfer."" However, he noted: ""With the U.S. military set to depart by Aug. 31, I think that it is probably unreasonable to expect that there will be normal airport operations on Sept. 1."" Price said the Taliban also wanted a functioning airport and stressed that the operation of the airport after Aug. 31 was ""not up to us"". The Pentagon said several nations are willing to work with the Taliban to keep the airport operating. U.N. AIR BRIDGE The World Food Programme, which runs the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, is planning to start flights over the weekend to create a humanitarian air bridge into Afghanistan, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. ""That will involve flights from Pakistan into various airports, outside of Kabul, into Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif,"" Dujarric said. ""WFP is appealing for about $18 million for the passenger service and $12 million for the cargo air bridge."" Dujarric said it is unclear what would happen at Kabul airport after Aug. 31. He described the airport as critical to the work of the United Nations, which has stressed that it plans to stay in Afghanistan to help those in need. ""It will be incumbent on ... the Taliban to ensure that there is a system in place, security in place, for Kabul to have a functioning airport,"" Dujarric said. The World Food Programme said this week that millions of people in Afghanistan were ""marching towards starvation"" as the COVID-19 pandemic and this month's upheaval, on top of the existing hardships, drive the country to catastrophe. The World Health Organization said on Friday that medical supplies in Afghanistan would run out in days, with little chance of re-stocking them. ""Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,"" WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said. As aid groups struggle to keep supply routes into the country open after the Aug. 31 departure of foreign troops, Afghans trying to leave the country are finding the few remaining exits slamming shut. Several European Union countries have said they have ended evacuation operations from Kabul, and the United States has said that by Monday it will prioritise the removal of its last troops and military equipment. Afghans with valid documents will be able to travel in the future at any time, a senior Taliban official said on Friday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Fed's Powell holds fast to 'this year' timeline for bond-buying taper,5843,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a speech that affirmed an ongoing U.S. economic recovery and explained why there is no rush to tighten monetary policy, gave a detailed account on Friday of why he regards a spike in inflation as temporary and offered no signal on when the central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year."" In remarks to the annual Jackson Hole economic conference, Powell indicated the Fed will remain cautious in any eventual decision to raise interest rates as it tries to nurse the economy to full employment, saying he wants to avoid chasing ""transitory"" inflation and potentially discouraging job growth in the process - a defense in effect of the new approach to Fed policy he introduced a year ago. On the separate and potentially imminent decision by the U.S. central bank to begin reducing its $120 billion in monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, Powell said he agreed with the majority of his colleagues that if job growth continues it ""could be approriate...this year."" The weeks since the Fed's policy meeting in July ""brought more progress"" towards repairing the jobs market, Powell said, with nearly a million positions added and continued progress expected. But it also coincided with ""the further spread of the Delta variant"" of the coronavirus, Powell noted, raising risks that would need to be evaluated as the debate over the bond-buying ""taper"" continues ahead of theFed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting. In the days before Powell's speech, several Fed regional bank presidents said they were eager to get a taper underway, and to reduce the asset purchases fast, with some arguing the shift was needed to prepare for interest rate increases that may be needed sooner than expected. Data released earlier on Friday showed inflation continuing to rise. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge watched by the Fed, was up 4.2% in the 12 months through July, the third straight month it has been at least double the central bank's 2% target. read more Powell, however, was non-committal, and gave no precise indication of when a reduction in bond purchases might start. ""We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks,"" he said, signaling that Fed discussions about exactly when to reduce the bond-buying program not only remain unresolved, but must be squared against the health and economic risks posed by the highly contagious Delta variant. Stocks were trading higher after Powell's speech, with the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) hitting a record high, as investors took the view that Powell was signaling no rush to tighten policy. Treasury bond yields edged lower and the dollar (.DXY) weakened against a basket of trading-partner currencies. ""Powell understands that tapering will happen, but it's not going to happen sooner than later,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. 'PREPARED TO ADJUST' Powell's remarks offered a broad road map of where the U.S. central bank stands as it moves away from policies rolled out to counteract the pandemic's economic shock, while also accounting for the fact that the health crisis has not passed, and that millions of Americans remain out of work as a result of it. The pivot away from asset purchases now appears just a matter of time, as long as robust U.S. job growth continues through August and into the fall. Fed officials have said they expect the resurgent health crisis will not throw the recovery off track, though concerns about COVID-19 risks did force the central bank itself to move its Jackson Hole symposium from a mountain resort in Wyoming to a virtual event for the second year in a row. Expectations for continued job growth are in part based on reopened schools, eased childcare constraints, and a steady return to consumer spending on close-contact activities - developments that may be influenced by the worsening outbreak. Fed officials ""expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant’s effects,"" Powell said in his speech. ""For now, I believe that policy is well positioned; as always, we are prepared to adjust."" The next major decision, of when to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate from the current near-zero level, will be subject to a ""substantially more stringent test,"" Powell said, that satisfies Fed officials that the economy has reached maximum employment and inflation is sustainably at the 2% target. Powell, who spearheaded the new policy framework put in place by the Fed last year, is being considered by President Joe Biden for a second term as head of the central bank. Powell's current term expires early next year. Much of Powell's speech on Friday was devoted to an exposition of why he feels current high inflation does not necessarily meet the test because it is likely to pass, with the reasons ranging from supply chain bottlenecks that are likely to ease to globalization acting as an anchor on prices. While the current fast pace of price increases is ""a cause for concern,"" Powell said it would also be damaging if the Fed jumped the gun with a premature decision to hike rates. ""We have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis,"" Powell said. ""If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary ... the ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Osaka bats aside recent disappointment ahead of U.S. Open title defence,2259,"NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka did not appear to be too worried over her recent run of poor results in the run up to the U.S. Open and remained confident about chances of successfully defending her title at Flushing Meadows. The world number three picked up the Australian Open title in February but after withdrawing from the French Open and skipping the grasscourt season to protect her mental health, she has struggled to regain her top form over the past month. Early defeats at both the Tokyo Olympics and in Cincinnati raised questions about the four-time Grand Slam champion's form. read more However, the 23-year-old Japanese power hitter said she was happy with her game. ""I feel pretty happy with how I'm playing. I thought I played two really tough matches in Cincinnati,"" Osaka told reporters at Flushing Meadows. ""Of course I'm not, like, declaring that I'll do amazing here. For me, I'm the one-match-at-a-time like person."" Osaka is a perennial threat on Arthur Ashe since hoisting her maiden major trophy at the hardcourt major three years ago, as world number one Ash Barty acknowledged. ""Naomi is a pure ball-striker. When she has time to set up particularly after her first serve, she's one of the best first-serve, first-strike players I've ever come up against,"" said Barty. ""On a hard court, there's not a lot of variation on the bounce. She can set up, trust the bounce, and really swing through the line. I think that's what makes her so damaging on these courts."" Her arrival in Flushing also comes amid new focus on athletes' mental health. Osaka withdrew from the French Open in June after being fined and threatened with expulsion for refusing to attend media conferences, saying her mental health was adversely impacted by the press obligations. read more She disclosed that she had suffered from depression for years, drawing applause from her legions of fans for opening up a conversation on mental health. ""I feel like there's a lot of things that I did wrong in that moment, but I'm also the type of person that's very in the moment,"" said Osaka. ""There's a lot of things that I learned to do better. Of course, I don't feel the same situation will happen again."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Purdue Pharma judge urges opioid plan opponents to settle with Sacklers,1101,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy on Friday urged opponents of the OxyContin maker’s reorganization plan, which would resolve widespread opioid litigation, to settle quickly with the company’s Sackler family owners because it would save time and money on appeals later. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made his remark during a hearing on Friday morning, five days before he is set to rule on the plan. The deal, if approved, would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the Sackler family owners from future litigation. Opponents of the deal have said the releases are too broad. “I think, having heard the lawyers from both sides – they are very talented lawyers, they know the risks they face – I would hope their clients would also be realistic about those risks,” Drain said. Purdue has said the deal, which directs funding toward opioid abatement programs, is worth more than $10 billion. The Sacklers have agreed to contribute approximately $4.5 billion.

Biden administration urges localities to block evictions after court ruling,2948,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Biden administration has written to state and local officials urging that they block unnecessary residential evictions, after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ended a federal moratorium aimed at keeping people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters on Friday. ""Our bottom line is this: No one should be evicted before they have the chance to apply for rental assistance, and no eviction should move forward until that application has been processed,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge and Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote to state governors, mayors and others. On Thursday, the nation's top court granted a request by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was to have run until Oct. 3, saying it was up to Congress to act. After the court order, over 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives pushed for congressional leaders to take action, writing a letter urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to revive the national eviction moratorium for the rest of the pandemic. ""We implore you to act with the highest levels of urgency to advance a permanent legislative solution in a must-pass legislative vehicle in order to extend the life-saving federal eviction moratorium for the duration of the deadly global health crisis,"" the lawmakers' letter to Pelosi and Schumer said. Signatories included Representative Cori Bush, who slept on the Capitol steps earlier this summer to protest a previous lapse in the federal pandemic eviction moratorium and the failure of a Democratic-majority Congress to do anything about it. Lawmakers so far have not passed any bills directly addressing evictions, but Pelosi on Friday said her chamber ""is assessing possible legislative remedies."" Congress approved $46 billion in rental assistance earlier in the pandemic, but the money has been slow to get to those who need it, with just $3 billion issued through June for rent, utilities and related expenses, according to U.S. Treasury data. House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters is ""examining the most effective way to expedite the flow of funding of rental assistance by states and localities,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democratic House members on Friday. The Biden administration letter to state and local authorities suggested they enact their own eviction moratoriums, noting that six states and the District of Columbia have already done so. It said state and local courts should also require landlords to apply for rental assistance that was approved in COVID-19 legislation earlier this year before commencing eviction proceedings. The letter said the Treasury Department is working with state and local governments to get the aid ""out the door and into the hands of renters and landlords."""

Class lawyers in App Store deal will seek up to $30 mln in fees,3437,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The class action plaintiffs' lawyers who reached a $100 million settlement this week with Apple Inc to end certain restrictions on its App Store will ask a California federal judge to approve up to $30 million in attorneys' fees for their work, according to terms of the proposed deal. Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, interim lead class counsel for the small software developers who are the plaintiffs, said in a court filing on Thursday announcing the deal that a $30 million fee award squared with attorney compensation in other class action settlements. The firms Freed Kanner London & Millen; Saveri & Saveri; and Sperling & Slater are on the plaintiffs’ executive committee. Small app developers sued Apple in 2019 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging anticompetitive practices, including the 30% commission the Cupertino, California-based company takes on the sale of apps and restrictions on direct communication between developers and their customers. Under the deal, Apple will create a $100 million small developer fund from which class members can seek compensation. Any leftover funds will be a ""cy pres"" distribution to Girls Who Code, a nonprofit focused on promoting gender equality in computer science. It also agreed to extend for three years a 15% commission adopted last year for small developers who make $1 million a year or less. The company also said it would allow developers ""to communicate directly with their customers regarding alternative payment options."" Hagens Berman name partner Steve Berman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Friday. A lawyer for Apple, Mark Perry, a Washington, D.C.-based partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, also did not immediately return a message seeking comment. In a statement on Thursday, Apple said the proposed settlement emerged from a ""productive dialogue"" between the company and the plaintiffs' lawyers. The plaintiffs' lawyers said on Thursday that they had invested more than 20,500 hours in the litigation. More than 5 million documents have been produced, the attorneys said, and Apple senior managers were among more than 50 depositions. The class counsel pointed to a 2019 survey that showed plaintiffs' lawyers received 30% as a median fee in settlements between $100 million and $249 million in antitrust cases. A preliminary settlement hearing is scheduled for Oct. 12 before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The judge is weighing a separate, higher-profile antitrust case against Apple filed by Epic Games Inc, maker of the ""Fortnite"" game. Epic's lawsuit more broadly confronts the control Apple asserts over its App Store. The case is Cameron v. Apple, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 4:19-cv-03074-YGR.

"U.S. weighing shorter timeline for COVID booster shots, says Biden",2220,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal health authorities are discussing shortening the timeline for COVID-19 booster shots to allow additional doses sooner than the eight-month window officials have been targeting, President Joe Biden said on Friday. For now, the planned timeline remains in place for adults to have another dose of the vaccine eight months after the original inoculation, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a news briefing later on Friday. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said U.S. regulators could approve a third COVID-19 shot of the two-dose Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Pfizer Inc-BioNTech AG (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) beginning at least six months after full vaccination. ""The question raised is: should it be shorter than eight months, should it be as little as five months? That's being discussed,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, adding that he had discussed the issue with his chief medical officer, Dr. Anthony Fauci, earlier on Friday. Biden said the U.S. booster program was ""promising"" and on track to start in mid-September, pending regulatory approval.

NIH starts study of COVID-19 booster shot in people with autoimmune diseases,1565,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is testing a booster shot of COVID-19 vaccines in people with autoimmune diseases who have not responded well to the primary vaccine course. The mid-stage study will be conducted among about 600 participants aged 18 and above who have been fully vaccinated with shots from either Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). https://bit.ly/3DpbYLl U.S. regulators earlier in the month authorized a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna for people with compromised immune systems, as concerns mounted about infections among such populations. ""Many people who have an autoimmune disease that requires immunosuppressive therapy have had a poor immune response to the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines, placing these individuals at high risk for the disease,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a statement. An estimated 8% of Americans have an autoimmune disease, which occurs when the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissues and organs. Participants in the NIH trial will receive an extra dose of the vaccine that was originally administered to them, and the study will record how many of them have a better antibody response four weeks after the booster shot. The trial will initially include people with one of five autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, with early results expected in November.

"Week Ahead in Insurance: Aug. 30, 2021",6709,"(Reuters) - Here are some events of interest to the Insurance Law community this week. All times are local unless otherwise noted. Monday, Aug. 30 10 a.m. – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear argument on whether military veterans whose mental-health issues preclude a felony conviction, and who are committed for mental-health treatment as a result, lose their eligibility for a “TDIU” rating – a finding that they are totally disabled because their service-connected impairments render them unemployable. Veteran Gary Philbrook applied for a TDIU evaluation while he was in custody at the Oregon State Hospital after stipulating to a judgment of “guilty (of attempted murder) except for insanity” under Oregon law in 2011. The Veterans Administration approved his application only after his release from custody in 2018. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims last year affirmed that Philbrook was not eligible before his release because the Veterans Benefits law bars TDIU ratings for “any period during which the veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility for conviction of a felony.” Philbrook argues that the Veterans Claims court erred in finding the statute unambiguous and clearly applicable to his situation. The case is Philbrook v. McDonough, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit No. 20-2233. For Philbrook: Kenneth Carpenter, Esq. For McDonough: Ashley Akers, U.S. Justice Department. Wednesday, Sept. 1 9 a.m. – The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear Texas-based roofing manufacturer Siplast Inc’s appeal from a ruling that its liability insurer, Employers Mutual Casualty Company (EMCC), had no duty to defend or indemnify it against a lawsuit by the Archdiocese of New York, which alleged that a school’s five-year-old roof was leaking and that Siplast had refused to honor its 20-year replacement guarantee. EMCC said there was no potential for coverage because breach of contract is not an accidental occurrence, and because the policy excluded damage to the insured’s own “work” (that is, the roof). A federal judge in Dallas ruled for EMCC last year based solely on the exclusion, saying the Archdiocese was seeking only the $5 million roof-replacement cost. Siplast says the Archdiocese also alleged water damage to the school’s ceilings and interiors, and had specifically demanded monetary damages “in excess of” the $5 million replacement estimate. The case is Siplast Inc. v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co., 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 20-11076. For Siplast: Christopher Thompson of Jackson Walker. For EMCC: Kevin Cain of Martin, Disiere, Jefferson & Wisdom. 2 p.m. – In a case on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will reconsider its previous ruling that North Dakota’s regulation of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) is federally preempted as a regulation of health plans governed by ERISA. The Supreme Court in February remanded the case for further consideration in light of its December decision in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), which revived an Arkansas law regulating PBM reimbursement rates. The justices said the Arkansas law “did not require ERISA plans to provide any particular benefit to any particular beneficiary in any particular way."" The PCMA argues that North Dakota’s law is still preempted because it is much broader than the Arkansas’ law. PCMA has drawn amicus support from the U.S. Chamber, America’s Health Insurance Plans, and the Association of Federal Health Organizations. Thirty state attorneys general and several pharmacy organizations have filed a brief in support of North Dakota. The case is Pharmaceutical Care Management Association v. Nizar Wehbi, et al., 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 18-2926. For PCMA: Michael Kimberly of McDermott Will & Emery. For Wehbi: Robert Smith of Katten Muchin Rosenman. Thursday, Sept. 2 10 a.m. – The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear its first COVID-19 business property insurance case, an appeal by the Guy Hepner art gallery in Manhattan from a ruling that its all-risk policy from The Hartford’s Sentinel Insurance Co. did not cover its losses from city and state shutdown orders because they did not qualify as “property damage.” The gallery argues that loss-of-use losses are covered under the policy’s business income interruption, extra expense, and civil authority provisions, and has asked the 2nd Circuit to certify the coverage question to the state’s highest court due to its “significant importance” to thousands of other New York businesses. The National Restaurant Association’s affiliated Restaurant Law Center, the New York State Restaurant Association, the New York City Hospitality Alliance and Mario Badescu Skin Care have filed amicus briefs supporting Guy Hepner. Sentinel has amicus support from American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. The case is 10012 Holdings Inc. DBA Guy Hepner v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. et al., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 21-80. For Guy Hepner: John Golaszewski of Casas Law Firm. For Sentinel: Jonathan Freiman. Friday, Sept. 3 2 p.m. – CVS Pharmacy’s opening brief on the merits is due at the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed in July to consider whether the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination provisions authorize private lawsuits over facially neutral practices that have a disparate impact on people with disabilities. CVS and CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, argues that the law allows private lawsuits only for intentional discrimination. The 9th Circuit rejected that argument last year, reviving a proposed class action by California HIV/AIDS patients who allege that Caremark discriminated against them by requiring ERISA-plan participants to use CVS or its mail-order pharmacy, as opposed to all other in-network pharmacies, to get the in-network price for the highest-cost tier of drugs. CVS argues that the 9th Circuit’s decision is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent interpreting Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that it deepens an existing circuit split between the 6th Circuit and the four other circuits which have considered the question. The case is CVS Pharmacy et al. v. John Doe et al., U.S. Supreme Court No. 20-1374. For CVS: Lisa Schiavo Blatt of Williams & Connolly. For Doe et al.: Gerald Sinclair Flanagan of Consumer Watchdog.

"U.S. COVID-19 tests again in short supply as infections soar, schools reopen",5214,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests increasingly in short supply as COVID-19 cases soar and schools and employers revive surveillance programs that will require tens of millions of tests, according to industry executives and state health officials. Test manufacturers including Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX.N), and Quidel Corp (QDEL.O) in recent months scaled back production of rapid COVID-19 tests, which can produce results on-site in minutes, as well as test kits that are sent to laboratories for analysis. The move followed a nearly 90% decline in testing and a similarly large drop in COVID-19 cases in the United States. Abbott in June shut down two production lines in Maine and closed a manufacturing plant in Illinois. Around the same time, Quidel shifted production away from COVID-19 tests. Becton Dickinson had also scaled back production in recent months. Now, with the Delta variant pushing U.S. COVID-19 cases well above 100,000 per day, test makers are working to quickly reverse course, industry executives and state officials told Reuters. ""We’re hiring people and turning on parts of our manufacturing network that were idled or slowed when guidance changed and demand plunged,"" Abbott said in a statement. However, testmakers including Abbott and Becton Dickinson cautioned that there may be supply constraints in the near term. “With the rise of cases from the Delta variant... there is currently some tightness in supply as manufacturers ramp back up,"" said Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesperson for Becton Dickinson, adding that the company expects inventory levels ""will normalize over the next couple of weeks."" Demand for COVID-19 tests has been largely driven by healthcare providers, employers and schools, he added. Supplies could tighten even further as more state governments and private employers demand staff either get vaccinated or agree to regular testing. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are among major employers requiring staff to be regularly tested. Testing in schools is a top priority for federal and state officials as a minority of the roughly 70 million school-age U.S. children have been vaccinated. Those under 12 are not yet eligible for the shots. Demand for diagnostic tests has surged nearly six-fold in the past two months, from around 250,000 per day in early July to nearly 1.5 million in mid-August, according to U.S. federal data. The data only tracks diagnostic tests that are run in laboratories. People wait in line for a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test at a back-to-school clinic in South Gate, Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 12, 2021. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo That demand is only expected to grow. More than half a dozen states, including California, Delaware, and South Carolina, have set up comprehensive surveillance testing programs for their public K-12 schools, while Pennsylvania and Arkansas are among at least a dozen other states developing similar plans. Even in states without such plans, many local school districts are rolling out surveillance programs. Ysleta Independent School District in El Paso, Texas, expects to need around 40,000 Abbott rapid tests per month to monitor students for COVID-19, said Lynly Leeper, the district’s chief financial and operational officer. Her school district had been planning to shut down its testing program until the Delta variant sent cases soaring in the state in recent weeks. SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNS Delaware, which was among the first to roll out a comprehensive surveillance testing program in July, has already begun to see some test shortages, said Dr. Rick Pescatore, an associate medical director in the state’s public health agency. The surge in test demand has sounded alarms among federal officials, who are “concerned that people are going to start shutting down our supply chain,” limiting the flexibility to respond to a spike in cases, said Quidel Chief Executive Douglas Bryant told Reuters. The recent increase in surveillance testing ""really stresses the supply chain,” said Dana Lerman, medical director at The COVID Consultants, a physicians group that provides COVID-19 testing and advisory services. Her organization has seen demand for rapid tests increase 200% since June. Even if testmakers are able to keep up with rising demand from U.S. schools, states will still face challenges covering the expense of widespread testing, which experts say will cost the average school district at least $1 million each year. Ysleta in El Paso said it expects it will cost around $3 million to safely test its students this school year, and is relying on Texas to provide it with funds. The Biden administration granted $10 billion to help states developing COVID-19 testing programs. Experts said the sum is far short of what states will need to cover testing for the full school year. “More federal funding will be necessary,"" said Dr. Antonia Sepulveda, president of the Association of Molecular Pathology that represents diagnostic testing laboratories, ""for institutions to continue comprehensive testing programs.""

U.S. regulators probe Peloton over treadmill injuries,2200,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) said on Friday U.S. regulators were investigating the company, adding to the exercise bike maker's woes as it deals with a backlash over reports of accidents involving its treadmills. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have subpoenaed the company for documents and information over injuries from its exercise machines, the company said in a filing with the U.S. securities regulator. Peloton recalled its Tread+ product in May, just weeks after saying there was ""no reason"" to stop using the exercise machine despite reports of the death of a child and multiple injuries. read more Its public disclosures related to the reports are also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Peloton said. ""Even with the treadmill 'fix' to prevent small children and pets from being injured, it is a high hurdle to get over when a child dies as a result of a product,"" said Walter Thompson, former president, American College of Sports Medicine. A Peloton logo is seen on an exercise bike after the ringing of the opening bell for the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, New York, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Chief Executive Officer John Foley publicly apologized in May for Peloton's initial response to the accident reports, and the company also laid out steps to improve on safety. read more Peloton said on Friday it had been named in several lawsuits associated with the recalls. ""We intend to cooperate fully with each of these investigations, and at this time, we are unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigations,"" the company said. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which in April had warned about the dangers of the Tread+ treadmills, is already investigating the injuries. Peloton said late on Thursday its near-term profitability would be affected due to a decision to slash the price of its exercise bike and higher commodity and marketing costs. read more The company's shares were trading down 6.6% at $106.50 in afternoon trade.

Taliban say Afghans will be able to travel freely in future,1879,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Afghans with valid documents will be able to travel in the future at any time, a senior Taliban official said on Friday in a televised address aimed at calming fears the movement planned harsh restrictions on freedom. ""The Afghan borders will be open and people will be able to travel at any time into and out of Afghanistan,"" Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, deputy head of the movement's political commission said. The message came as thousands have struggled to get onto the last flights leaving Kabul airport before a deadline for the Western evacuation operation ends next week. Calling on Afghans to unite to rebuild their country, Stanikzai said that trained and educated people should come back to work. ""The ground is prepared for the doctors, engineers and teachers that Afghanistan needs and for people from every profession, whether civilian or military. All are invited to start their work,"" he said. Coming after a separate statement calling on female health staff to return to work, the message underlined efforts by the Taliban to reassure Afghans and the international community that they do not plan a return to their previous harsh rule. The desperate scenes outside Kabul airport, where a suicide bomber killed at least 92 people on Thursday, have provided a dramatic image of the fears that many well-educated Afghans feel at the prospect of life under Taliban rule. With the afghani currency falling sharply, many banks still shut and food prices rising quickly, daily life has become much more difficult for many Afghans since the dramatic collapse of the Western-backed government this month. Stanikzai reiterated that the Taliban welcomed help from countries that wanted to play a positive role in Afghanistan though he said they would not accept interference in its internal affairs.

Moderna vaccine production continues in EU amid contamination probe,3612,"BRUSSELS/TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Production of Moderna (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccines at a plant in Spain can continue, the European Union drugs regulator said on Friday, while it carries out its investigation of a suspected metallic contamination incident. Japan on Thursday suspended the use of 1.63 million doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide, more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), received reports of contaminants in some vials. The contaminant found in a batch delivered to Japan is believed to be a metallic particle, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing health ministry sources. The European Union drugs regulator said it was investigating the incident at the Spanish plant run by Rovi (ROVI.MC), but did not find reasons to seek a temporary suspension of production after an initial assessment. ""COVID-19 vaccine production in Rovi is able to continue, following a preliminary risk assessment,"" the European Medicines Agency told Reuters in a statement. ""An investigation into the root cause is ongoing. EMA will be able to provide more information as the investigation progresses,"" it added. Moderna has so far delivered to the EU nearly 75 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, EU public data show. The company has two contracts with the 27-nation bloc for up to 460 million shots. Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets outside of the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue on a production line. A spokesperson said the company could not say anything more while it was investigating. Moderna put the lot in question and two adjacent ones on hold. JAPANESE INVESTIGATION NHK, in a report published late on Thursday, cited health ministry sources as saying the contaminant was believed to be a particle that reacted to magnets and was therefore suspected to be a metal. Moderna has described it as ""particulate matter"" that did not pose a safety or efficacy issue. A Japanese health ministry official said the composition of the contaminant has not been confirmed. In a statement, Takeda said it asked Moderna to investigate the issue and that it would work with the ministry to replace the affected supply. News of the contaminant could prove a fresh setback for Japan's inoculation drive as it struggles to persuade many - particularly young people - to get vaccinated. On Friday, eight more prefectures entered a state of emergency, meaning about 80% of Japan's population is under coronavirus restrictions. The government reported nearly 25,000 new infections and severe cases at a record 2,000 for Thursday. The ministry described the suspension of the Moderna batches as a precaution but it prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations and the European drugs regulator to launch an investigation. Airline ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) said it had secured more Moderna supplies and would resume inoculations on Saturday after a two-day suspension of the shots. Another health ministry official said it would take ""some time"" to tell how many shots from the contaminated batch had been administered in Japan. Kyodo News estimated at least 176,000 have been used based on municipalities' figures. About 54% of Japan's population has received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccination programme, said he did not expect the contamination issue to affect the government's goal of fully inoculating the adult population by November.

Canada approves Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents,1088,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Canada on Friday authorized the use of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents, with the country's health regulator calling it safe and effective for the 12 to 17 age-group. The vaccine was previously authorized for use by Health Canada in only adults over the age of 18. The two-shot vaccine is not yet authorized in the United States to treat children between 12 to 17, but was recommended for approval in Europe and has been cleared in the UK. read more While most children develop mild or no symptoms with COVID-19, they are still able to spread the virus and some remain at risk of becoming seriously ill. Canadian health authorities said they will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine and take action if any concerns are identified. The Washington Post had reported last week that U.S. health officials are reviewing Canadian data that suggests a higher risk of a rare heart condition in younger adults than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, citing people familiar with the review. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Clock ticking for Lebanese cancer patients as shortages bite,4569,"BEIRUT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Christine Tohme had already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer when Lebanon's financial system began to unravel in 2019. She never expected that two years later her country's economic meltdown would pose a direct threat to her life. The 50-year-old was later diagnosed with third stage colon cancer in February. Having undergone surgery earlier this year, she was then prescribed six sessions of chemotherapy. But with shortages of basic goods plaguing every aspect of Lebanese life, Tohme was told there was no guarantee she would complete her treatment as hospitals run out of vital drugs. So far she has only undergone three sessions. Her cancer has metastasized to her lymph nodes and she fears if she cannot complete her treatment she will only have months to live. Having knocked on every door to try to secure her medication at any cost, Tohme took to the streets on Thursday, despite her ailing health, to join a sit-in protest with other cancer patients, doctors and non-governmental organisations. ""I'm hoping that God gives me strength, as I don't have that much, to stand on my two feet and take part so that maybe people will see us and sympathise with us and send us treatment,"" Tohme told Reuters two days before the event. ""I have kids, I want to be happy with them and see them get married and become a grandmother."" Lebanese healthcare workers have warned for months of declining stocks of vital medical supplies. Many pharmacy shelves are empty as the country's foreign reserves are depleted on the back of a subsidy scheme used to finance fuel, wheat and medicine that cost the state around $6 billion a year. This month the central bank declared it could no longer finance fuel imports at subsidised exchange rates because its dollar reserves had been so badly depleted. CANCER HAS NO PATIENCE Tohme's case is not unique. Dr. Joseph Makdessi, who heads the haematology and oncology department at the Saint George Hospital University Medical Centre, estimates around 10% of cancer patients have been unable to source their treatment in the past couple of months. ""We need an immediate solution,"" Makdessi said. ""I can't tell my patients this is a crisis and ask them to wait till it eases because this disease has no patience."" Christine Tohme, a cancer patient, gestures as she talks during an interview with Reuters in the Jnah neighbourhood of Beirut, August 24, 2021. Picture taken August 24, 2021. REUTERS/Alaa Kanaan Lebanon's deeply indebted state is struggling to raise funds from abroad amidst political paralysis and has gradually eradicated many subsidies. But cancer medications are still subsidised, meaning in order for agents to import them they have to wait for financing from the central bank, which has all but run down its reserves. Yet Dr. Makdessi isn't optimistic that easing subsidies on cancer drugs will solve his patients' pressing problem. Some chemotherapy treatments, which can cost as much as $5,000 per session, are currently subsidized so the patient pays around $400, with the state bearing the rest of the cost. ""Even if you lift this subsidy to make the medication available, many patients won't be able to afford it,"" he said. The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan, who has been raiding depots storing large quantities of drugs and medical supplies, partly blamed the shortages on traders hoarding supplies. The Barbara Nassar Association for Cancer Patient Support, the Lebanese advocacy group that organised Thursday's sit-in, has provided medication worth more than $1.5 million in 2020 through in-kind donations from former patients. But now Hani Nassar, whose wife Barbara founded the organisation before passing away from the disease years ago, says the country's fractious politics is hampering efforts to alleviate the problem. ""The central bank wants to remove the subsidy and the health ministry doesn't and in the meantime the patient is sitting there without treatment,"" Nassar said. At Thursday's sit-in, patients said they were reaching out to whoever could help them get a second chance at life. ""After all I endured, I lost my nails and hair and my body changed, now I reached this point of not finding the treatment and this really set me back,"" engineer Bahaa Costantine said. ""I was a person who was full of energy and loves life, I don't want to be a bride for heaven, this is what I refuse. I hope my voice reaches someone who can help.""

WHO hopes for air bridge into northern Afghanistan in days,2812,"GENEVA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Medical supplies will run out within days in Afghanistan, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, announcing that it hopes to establish an air bridge into the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by then with the help of Pakistani authorities. Trauma kits and emergency supplies for hospitals, as well as medicines for treating chronic malnutrition in children are among priority items for Afghanistan, where 18 million people depend on aid, the WHO's regional emergency director said. ""What remains certain is that humanitarian needs are enormous and growing,"" Rick Brennan told a U.N. briefing. An Islamic State attack killed 92 people, including 13 U.S. service members, outside the gates of Kabul airport on Thursday evening. L1N2PY01Q More than 200 people wounded in the bombings have been taken to hospitals in the Afghan capital, including a facility run by Italian NGO EMERGENCY whose trauma supplies are dwindling, said Brennan, speaking from Cairo. ""Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,"" he said. ""One of the problems we have in Afghanistan right now is there is no civil aviation authority functioning, but we are working with Pakistan particularly in the context of Mazar-i-Sharif airport. Because they can work with contacts on the ground so that all the necessary steps to land an aircraft, to land a cargo aircraft, can be put in place,"" Brennan said. Pakistan International Airlines will provide air transport for the operation, while WHO will arrange logistics on the ground, WHO spokesperson Inas Hamam said. Security arrangements were still being determined. U.S. military forces, who have guarded Kabul airport, are due to withdraw on Aug. 31, leaving a vacuum. Turkey has not made a final decision on a Taliban request for support to run the airport after foreign forces withdraw, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, adding talks were still underway. read more Insurance rates for flying into Afghanistan had ""skyrocketed at prices we have never seen before"" in the 12 hours since the blast, Brennan said. ""So we are trying to jump through that hoop at the moment and once we have addressed that we will hopefully be airborne in the next 48 to 72 hours."" Some 97% of the health facilities across Afghanistan monitored by WHO are functioning, he said. ""The more sobering news is these health facilities are rapidly running out of medical supplies and WHO is not currently able to meet these needs."" Some health care workers, some of them women trained in recent years as midwives, nurses and doctors, have fled, adding to the ""enormous brain drain"" from the country, Brennan added.

British music festivals ready to rock despite high COVID-19 cases,3144,"LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of revellers will descend on late summer music festivals across Britain this weekend, armed with a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination in an effort to curb rising infections. Reading and Leeds, twin events that are a rite of passage for post-exam teenagers, will be two of the biggest since the government removed restrictions in July following a rapid vaccine rollout. Reading had a capacity of 105,000 in 2019. With Monday a public holiday in England, other large gatherings are being staged across the country, including the 70,000-strong Creamfields event in northwest England. The traditional Notting Hill Carnival in London has however been cancelled again. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said this month that a successful hosting of the British Grand Prix and Wimbledon tennis tournament last month showed mass events could be held safely, but that caution was needed in crowded settings. However, many health experts remain concerned that people will lose their inhibitions in the excitement, causing a spike in cases. Soccer matches in the Euro 2020 tournament and a surfing festival in Cornwall have already led to significant outbreaks in one of the countries hardest hit by the virus. Cornwall Council has said 4,700 cases could be linked to the Boardmasters festival, which attracted about 50,000 people to the small seaside town of Newquay this month. Meradin Peachey, director of public health for the area that covers Reading to the west of London, said a spike was a concern given that older teenagers were offered vaccines only this month. ""Sixteen, seventeen year olds are the main groups that are going to be there and they're not covered yet,"" she told BBC News. ""We are trying to ask people to show proof of a lateral flow test before you even get anywhere near the gates."" British infections have started to rise again, with about 34,000 cases and around 100 deaths being reported per day in the last week. But admissions to hospital remain well below previous peaks of the pandemic. 'UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL' Scientists believe the trigger points for spreading the virus are public transport and shared cars to get to events as outdoor gatherings themselves, even with large numbers, can be relatively risk free. Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said mixing at festivals was a risk when the rate of infection was about 25 times higher than a year ago thanks to the Delta variant. ""I think there's a greater capacity for people to be more intimate with one another, up close and personal, than in regimented seating you'll see somewhere like the Grand Prix,"" he said, referring to the Formula One race. With the music industry desperate to start touring again, festival organisers say the need for a negative test or vaccine will prevent cases from surging. Pop-up vaccination clinics will be on site at the Reading and Leeds festivals headlined by UK rapper Stormzy, but no one under the influence of drink or drugs will be inoculated, health organisers said.

Taliban say Afghan women health service staff should go back to work,1172,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Taliban have asked all women healthcare workers to return to work, a spokesman said on Friday amid mounting pressure on public services that has risen as many trained and educated Afghans have fled the country. Women have been discouraged from going to work and even been turned away from their offices, prompting fears the movement will repeat the stance of their previous government before 2001 when women were not allowed to work. However, growing complaints that the fragile health system was short of staff appear to have prompted an about-face. ""The Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate advises all women employees in the centre and provinces that they should attend work regularly,"" a statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. ""They will face no impediment to performing their duties from the Islamic Emirate,"" he said. Since the Taliban swept into Kabul on Aug. 15, they have struggled to re-establish basic services, with many specialists associated with the Western-backed government joining an exodus out of the country or remaining at home out of fear of reprisal.

Fed's Powell likely to give few hints on bond-buying taper timeline,5876,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - (In Aug 26 story, corrects Kelly's title to research associate in third paragraph) Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech to the Jackson Hole economic conference on Friday will likely offer few new hints about when the U.S. central bank may start reducing its massive asset purchases, analysts said. But Powell could tackle the sensitive task of explaining why tapering the $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities doesn't mean an imminent interest rate hike, advancing an effort by Fed policymakers to keep traders from pushing up borrowing costs more than the central bank may feel is warranted or healthy for an economy with millions still unemployed. ""He will do his best to say these are independent decisions ... and one does not necessarily speed up the other,"" said Steve Kelly, a research associate at the Yale School of Management. ""That's the biggest challenge ... this communication around tapering and rate increases."" Fed officials agree. The minutes of their July 27-28 policy meeting show that many thought it would be important to emphasize there is no ""mechanical link"" between a bond-buying taper and rate hikes. Rejecting that link won't be simple. Many Fed officials also felt it would be better to end the bond-buying program before raising rates. And they continue to debate whether to dial down the purchases quickly or stretch them out, for perhaps as many as eight months. Additionally, some policymakers argue the bond purchases aren't helping much anyway, since they are aimed at bolstering demand but can't address the bottlenecks businesses face as they struggle to meet that demand as the economy rapidly reopens. With so much unsettled, the odds were always long that Powell would use his remarks to the Kansas City Fed's central banking conference, which normally takes place in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but is being held virtually for the second straight year, to satisfy investors' craving for taper timeline details. That's especially so now, as the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus shows signs of slowing the U.S. economic recovery, particularly in regions of the country hardest hit by infections. read more The data raises new questions about what appeared to be an emerging internal consensus at the Fed's meeting last month for beginning to withdraw its extraordinary support for the economy later this year. Even Dallas Fed Kaplan, among the biggest supporters at the central bank of an early taper, said last week he is starting to see signs of Delta's impact and will keep an open mind in the run-up to the Fed's policy meeting next month. read more ""It's hard to imagine the Fed committing to a specific tapering timeline in light of the ongoing public health crisis,"" Aneta Markowska, a Jefferies economist, said of Powell's upcoming speech. Powell, who is due to speak via webcast at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) on Friday, may acknowledge the economy's progress toward full employment, Markowska and other economists said. Although Powell will want to keep the door open to starting the taper in November, he will be ""very cautious"" about locking in such a timeline, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note this week. COMPLICATED MESSAGING Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to add another 725,000 jobs this month, on top of the nearly 1.9 million gained in June and July. And inflation - a fresh read of which be released shortly before Powell's speech - has been running above the Fed's 2% goal for months, though most U.S. central bank policymakers expect it to moderate later this year. The data suggests to many Fed policymakers that the economy is near to making ""substantial further progress"" toward full employment and 2% inflation, the bar they have set before they agree to pare the monthly asset purchases. But to preserve low long-run interest rates for an economy that is still recovering from the downdraft triggered by the pandemic, Powell will also want to underscore that the hurdle for tapering is far shy of meeting the three-part trigger for rate hikes. The bar for raising borrowing costs includes actually attaining full employment and seeing inflation on track to be moderately above 2% for some time. ""It's complicated messaging right now,"" said Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. ""The reality is the tapering is not separate from the rate hike: once you start the tapering, you kind of start a clock on the rate hike."" And yet it is that kind of jump-the-gun reaction that Powell will want to head off. In 2013, when then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke tried to smoothly foreshadow a coming reduction in bond purchases, traders responded by driving up long-term rates so sharply that the Fed ultimately had to delay dialing down its purchases. Markets typically judge Fed communications most harshly at such policy turns. If they do so again, it could prove awkward timing for Powell, as U.S. President Joe Biden weighs whether to nominate him for another four years as Fed chief. Deteriorating grades from Wall Street notwithstanding, it's clear the Powell-led Fed is on a path to taper, even if his speech this week is expected to offer little news on exactly when. Even the dovish San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said last week that she's confident the economy will meet the bar the central bank has set for beginning to reduce its support by the end of this year. ""The key message there is that it's time really to think about dialing back that level of support we are giving to the economy because the economy is really standing on its own two feet,"" Daly said in a virtual interview with Barron's Roundtable, adding, however, that she would be ""open-minded"" about the Delta variant's impact and could see a delay into next year.

JHL Biotech founders convicted of conspiring to steal Genentech trade secrets,3239,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Racho Jordanov and Rose Lin, co-founders of Taiwanese biopharmaceutical company JHL Biotech, have been convicted in a San Francisco federal court of conspiring to steal trade secrets related to blockbuster drugs made by Roche's Genentech Inc, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. Jordanov, 73, and Lin, 72, admitted to hiring former Genentech employees and using their stolen information to copy its cancer and cystic-fibrosis drugs, as well as defrauding JHL's planned manufacturing partner, French drugmaker Sanofi, out of $101 million, DOJ said in a Thursday press release. Jordanov and Lin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit trade-secret theft and wire fraud on Tuesday under an agreement that dismisses other claims against them if they comply with its terms, the DOJ said. They had pleaded not guilty after being indicted in July. Text of the plea agreements wasn't immediately available. DOJ declined to comment. JHL, now known as Eden Biologics, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Jordanov's attorneys Edward Swanson and Britt Evangelist of Swanson & McNamara or Lin's attorneys Miles Ehrlich and Amy Craig of Ramsey & Ehrlich. Jordanov and Lin, who formerly worked at Genentech, schemed to steal San Francisco-based Genentech's trade secrets between 2011 and 2019, according to DOJ's announcement. They co-founded JHL in 2012 and allegedly used the secrets to speed the development of its biosimilars. JHL made biosimilars of Genentech's cystic fibrosis drug Pulmozyme and cancer drugs Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, according to the indictment. The cancer drugs are some of Roche's most commercially successful, each bringing in over $4 billion in sales last year. Jordanov and Lin also admitted to defrauding Sanofi into a strategic partnership by concealing that JHL's biosimilars were based on the stolen trade secrets. Xanthe Lam, a former principal scientist for Genentech who secretly worked for JHL, and her husband Allen Lam pleaded guilty in July to stealing trade secrets from the company and passing them to competitors including JHL. Genentech and JHL settled a related civil trade-secret case last year for an undisclosed amount of money and an agreement for JHL to stop using the offending technology. U.S. District Judge William Alsup will preside over Jordanov and Lin's sentencing on December 7. The case is United States v. Jordanov, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, 3:21-cr-0227.

Dozens of unaccompanied Afghan children evacuated to the United States,2664,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - About three dozen unaccompanied Afghan children have been placed in U.S. government custody after being evacuated from Afghanistan during the hurried U.S. withdrawal in recent weeks, U.S. officials told Reuters. The children arrived at the Kabul airport without a parent or legal guardian and were referred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) refugee office upon arriving in the United States, according to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal government operations. Of 34 Afghan children taken into U.S. government custody as of Thursday, 24 remain after some were quickly placed with close family members. The children in custody are housed in U.S.-government shelters experienced with caring for Afghan children, said the official, who would not disclose the location for safety reasons. The unaccompanied children are part of a growing number of refugees airlifted out Afghanistan in what President Joe Biden's administration says is one of the biggest airlifts in history. Since Aug. 14, the United States has airlifted about 105,000 people out of the country, a figure that includes U.S. citizens, Afghans and foreign nationals. The U.S. government has not said how many Afghans have arrived in the United States, but advocates say thousands have already entered the country. read more The unaccompanied children being placed in U.S. government custody do not have parents in the United States and, in some cases, the parents are deceased, the official said. ""If their parents aren't here now but will be, we need a place for them to go in the interim and then they will be united when their parents get here,"" the official said. The children make up a fraction of the nearly 15,000 unaccompanied children in the care of the HHS refugee office, most of whom come from Central America and arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border. An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that it was working to ensure the children would be ""placed with licensed care providers that are able to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services."" HHS is working to recruit more Afghan foster families to its network in the event some of the children cannot be placed with family members in the United States, the official said. Most of the unaccompanied Afghan children are older teens, the official said. Of the 10 children not currently in HHS custody, four were placed with close family members with whom they arrived, the person said. The other six were en route from the custody of U.S. border authorities to placements in an HHS-run shelter. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Judge extends block on Texas governor's migrant transit ban,4075,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas has blocked enforcement of an executive order by the state's governor, Greg Abbott, aimed at restricting the transport of migrants through the state amid a surge in border crossings and the COVID-19 pandemic, pending the outcome of legal challenges by the Biden administration and advocacy groups. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso on Thursday said the July executive order interferes with the federal government's ability to make immigration determinations and to hire contractors to transport migrants between facilities. ""As with the other States and their governors, Texas and Governor Abbott have broad authority to prevent and limit the spread of the coronavirus ... but they have presented no evidence in this case that (the ban) will be effective to achieve this goal,"" Cardone wrote. Cardone on Aug. 3 had issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the ban. Thursday's order converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction, which will remain in place pending the outcome of the two consolidated lawsuits. Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did the U.S. Department of Justice. Abbott, a Republican, said in issuing the order that it was aimed at preventing migrants from potentially spreading COVID-19. The order permits only ""law enforcement officials"" to provide ground transport for migrants detained for illegally crossing the southern border. The order also gives state police the authority to stop any vehicle suspected of carrying migrants and send it back to its point of origin. The Biden administration in its lawsuit claims the order permits Texas state officials to make determinations based on immigration status in violation of federal law and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The order also would unlawfully permit Texas state troopers to interfere with the transport of migrants by private contractors that are routinely hired by the federal government, DOJ said. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a similar challenge to Abbott's order earlier this month on behalf of several nonprofits. The ACLU says Abbott's order bars anyone from transporting the very people whom the federal government has intentionally released pending immigration proceedings, such as asylum applicants. In opposing the bid for a preliminary injunction, Texas argued that the object of the order is public health, an area of traditional state authority, and not immigration. The state said that in June, federal authorities reported a 900% increase in the number of COVID-positive migrants detained at the border. But Cardone on Thursday said that regardless of the object of the order, it clearly would have the effect of disrupting federal enforcement of immigration laws. ""To consider only the regulation’s purpose ... would enable state legislatures to nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by identifying some other policy that may be furthered by the state law,"" she wrote. And Texas had not shown that the recent surge in COVID cases among migrants was any larger than rates among U.S. citizens, Cardone said. The case is USA v.

Qiagen shares hit 21-year high as COVID-19 test demand revives,2295,"FRANKFURT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - German genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE) is seeing demand for its COVID-19 tests firming up again, leading it to believe that sagging demand in July was temporary, Chief Financial Officer Roland Sackers said on Friday. The stock extended gains to hit a 21-year high after the comments, trading 2.6% higher at 47.51 euros by 1520 GMT versus a record 61.24 set in 2000. Qiagen, whose shareholders a year ago rebuffed a takeover bid by life science tools maker Thermo Fisher (TMO.N), had said in July that faster-than-expected uptake of vaccination campaigns weighed on demand for its diagnostics kits, prompting it to cut its full-year guidance. Sackers told Reuters that demand for tests had taken yet another turn as continued breakthrough infections from the Delta coronavirus variant in some vaccinated people was fuelling test kit demand. ""We are now at a turning point where we realise that a one-off boost is turning into normal business. COVID is becoming an infectious disease that stays with us. Therefore the tests will stay,"" he said. In July, Qiagen predicted currency-adjusted sales growth of at least 12% in 2021, down from a previous outlook of 18%-20% amid a dip in demand for COVID-19 tests, even though second-quarter non-COVID related business including latent tuberculosis tests surpassed expectations. ""A growing COVID business is an additional upside to our guidance and it looks like we can realise some of that upside,"" Sackers added, when asked about the revised outlook. ""I'm very confident that we'll have a good third quarter."" Industry executives and health officials have told Reuters that U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests as infection cases soar, and schools and employers revive surveillance programmes. read more A spokesperson for Qiagen, which also serves the U.S. market, said it had the capacity to meet growing demand there. Asked about the prospect of Qiagen becoming a takeover target again, Sackers said he had strong confidence in the group's growth potential but would not rule out any tie-up. Qiagen could purchase companies worth well over $1 billion but share buybacks were also an option to spend excess cash, he added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Zoning rules create affordability and economic benefits,8364,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 27, 2021 - Increasingly, municipalities across the United States seek to create affordable housing for their constituents. Some regulatory zoning schemes targeting affordability, like transferable density units and development credits, have been around for years, while others, like allowing more properties to be used for rental purposes, are relatively new (or at least new to some jurisdictions). Developers may leverage some such regulatory schemes into opportunities to offset hurdles like increased materials costs. However, developers and their counsel will need to review any new zoning regulatory schemes carefully as some rules that are nominally designed to address affordable housing and otherwise spur development may not do so in practice. At their core, many zoning regulations designed to make housing more affordable seek to increase the density of units within a jurisdiction. Putting more units in a smaller area of real property will theoretically make housing more accessible within that area, thereby reducing the prices of dwelling units in that area overall. Experts are mixed on the results of such approaches. Efficacy aside, one such tactic to promote affordability is to permit accessory dwelling units on otherwise single-family parcels of real property. While specific definitions vary, an accessory dwelling unit is generally an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit constructed on a parcel of real property that already contains a primary residence. Such an accessory dwelling unit should provide full living facilities (e.g., bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living area) to its occupants separate from those living facilities provided in the primary residence. Some jurisdictions have long implemented and expanded zoning regimes to encourage the use of accessory dwelling units. California, for example, first implemented statewide statutes related to accessory dwelling units decades ago. See e.g., Cal. Gov. Code § 65852 et seq. The state continues to promote the use of accessory dwelling units, at least for the time being, such as by offering state-level funding, See e.g., Cal. Health & Safety Code § 50515.03. The state also continues to update its accessory dwelling unit-statutory regime regularly, demonstrating that the policy remains top-of-mind for lawmakers. Other jurisdictions have only recently implemented zoning provisions permitting widespread use of accessory dwelling units and have not done so with the same level of detail as California. For example, the Metropolitan Council of Nashville, Tenn., recently approved a detached accessory dwelling unit overlay district to permit the construction of detached accessory dwelling units in certain single-family zoning districts. See Metropolitan Council Ordinance BL2021-620 (""Nashville DADU Ordinance""). One express goal of the Nashville DADU Ordinance is to address the ""relative lack of affordable housing in the center-city of Nashville."" Id. Likewise, the city of Gainesville, Fla., added accessory dwelling units as a permitted use within various zoning districts, including single-family zoning districts, just within the past few years. See City Commission Ordinance No. 190988 (""Gainesville ADU Ordinance""). Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville DADU Ordinance provides a prime example of the types of pitfalls that may face a business or individual who seeks to take advantage of new ""affordability"" regimes. For example, the Nashville DADU Ordinance requires that any new detached accessory dwelling units with the detached accessory dwelling unit overlay district must comply with such standards as those related to ""lot area, setbacks, bulk & massing, design, and access."" See Nashville DADU Ordinance. Suppose a particular parcel of property on which a detached accessory dwelling unit may be technically permitted is not large enough for a detached accessory dwelling unit to be installed on such parcel in compliance with applicable setback lines. In that case, the new regime will not practically benefit such parcel. In other words, the new regime will not increase affordability for a jurisdiction if the parcels to which the regime may nominally be applied cannot technically comply with the regime's requirements. Of course, such hurdles are not unique to Nashville. State of California. For comparison, the extensive California accessory dwelling unit-statutory regime includes at least certain language that appears to reduce obstacles using accessory dwelling unit regimes. Among other things, Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code provides that an application for an applicable accessory dwelling unit should be ""approved ministerially without discretionary review or a hearing."" Such language implies that a local government should not be permitted to bar the construction of an accessory dwelling unit based on immeasurable, discretionary factors. Of course, California (at the state level) still gives local governments the discretion to require accessory dwelling units to comply with setbacks and technical requirements. Gainesville, Florida. At the other end of the spectrum, the Gainesville ADU Ordinance imposes relatively few restrictions on accessory dwelling units. Instead, the ordinance broadly permits accessory dwelling units within residential zoning districts, without requiring that a special overlay be applied to such residential parcels. However, as in those rules described above, the City Commission still does require that accessory dwelling units comply with setbacks and technical requirements. The foregoing analysis merely scratches the surface of the referenced ordinances and statutes but can be applied to new and existing zoning regulatory schemes across the country. Such regimes may include, among other things, blanket increases in permitted density, loosened restrictions on short-term rentals, or development incentives offered in exchange for the construction of affordable housing units. By carefully reviewing the language of any new zoning regulatory scheme, developers may find a viable strategy for capitalizing on affordability-based zoning changes. In doing so, such persons may find unique opportunities to increase their projects' density and profitability. While accessory dwelling units are not independently transferable, even a larger scale developer may still benefit by offering units that are more attractive to potential buyers (such as by offering a source of passive income) thereby commanding higher prices. Other affordability-based zoning changes would likely offer additional opportunities. In each case, developers and their counsel will need to review each specific zoning rule at issue to determine how and whether compliance with the rule will be technically and economically feasible and beneficial.

Vaccinated Chileans shout and dance for study to see if the show can go on for concerts,2379,"SANTIAGO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Vaccinated Chileans on Thursday night attended the first of a series of concerts that will be studied in a clinical trial to see if mass events like concerts can safely resume without spreading COVID. The trial is the result of a tie-up between Chile's Musical Authors and Performers' Society and the University of Chile to assess contagion risks at such events and try to get the live music industry back on its feet after the near-fatal blow dealt by the COVID pandemic and lengthy lockdowns in Chile. A total of 200 seats will be available for each of three concerts given by local rock band Chancho En Piedra over the next three months in a carefully ventilated venue in the capital Santiago. Attendees must show proof of vaccination, wear masks and submit to PCR tests prior to the event and again eight days after. Preliminary results will be issued in September. Similar trials have been conducted with audiences of several thousand people attending rock concerts in Barcelona and Liverpool and revealed a lower rate of COVID spread than in the community, though in the case of the Liverpool trial, less than half of attendees returned the post-concert COVID test. read more The Chilean trial is unique in that it specifies that attendees must be vaccinated, taking advantage of the fact that Chile has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 70% of its population already fully inoculated. Dr. Alejandro Afani, who is leading the trial at the University of Chile's Clinical Hospital, said a lull in COVID cases in Chile and the high vaccination rate made it an apt moment to try restarting mass events. Eduardo Ibeas, vocalist with the band, said he hoped the participants would take other self-protection measures seriously. ""We want a positive result from this so that live shows can restart as soon as possible,"" he said. Among those queuing up to take pre-concert COVID tests on Thursday was Catalina Osorio. She said she was looking forward to letting her hair down for the first time in a long time. “I think that for our mental health it's really important to be able to access culture, art and music above all, to be able to go back to seeing live artists, jump, shout, sing, that experience that fills your body,"" she said.

Biden shedding support from independent voters as Delta variant spreads - Reuters poll,5158,"NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is shedding support from independents, a crucial voting bloc that helped Democrats win the White House and Congress last year, as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases slows the country's return to normal from the pandemic, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. The drop in support comes at a precarious time for the first-year president, whose administration has been under fire for its handling of the pullout of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. On Thursday, more than a dozen U.S. troops and dozens of civilians were killed when suicide bombers struck the crowded gates of Kabul airport. At home, the COVID-19 pandemic has surged anew, especially in populous Republican-led states such as Florida and Texas that have resisted new restrictions to hamper the spread of the Delta variant of the virus. Despite Biden's push for vaccinations, 39% of U.S. residents have not had even their first shot, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national opinion poll, conducted Aug. 13-19, found that Biden’s net approval among independents dropped by 14 percentage points overall since June, and by 19 points for his handling of the coronavirus. Still, a slim majority of independents - 53% - said they approve of Biden's pandemic response. Independents are turning away from Biden even though most share his concerns about the coronavirus and have consistently joined with Democrats in supporting more preventive measures. The August poll found that 66% of independents support mask requirements at restaurants, gyms and on airplanes, while 25% oppose them. Fifty-five percent say vaccines should be required for people who want to go back to the office, while 37% say they should not. When asked who should be blamed for the resurgence of COVID-19, 47% of independents said unvaccinated people, compared with 12% who blamed Biden. The decline in Biden's popularity is more likely to be a sign of exhaustion with the pandemic than it is about their support for his ideas, said Robert Blendon, a health policy and public opinion expert at the Harvard School of Public Health. Josh Schwerin, a Democratic strategist who worked for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said Biden and Democrats must continue to draw a contrast with their approach and that of Republicans such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has pushed back against mask and vaccine mandates. ""Thousands of Americans are dying as a result,"" he said. BROADER EROSION After largely favoring Biden over Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the 2020 election, independents are now evenly split in their support for the president: 46% approve of Biden’s performance in office, while 46% disapprove. Two months ago, 52% of independents approved of Biden's overall performance, while 38% disapproved. The decline is part of a broader erosion in Biden’s popularity among all Americans as the president deals with the pandemic and the fallout from Afghanistan. Last week, Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that for the first time in his presidency more Americans disapproved of Biden than approved of him. Among all Americans, Biden's net approval for the coronavirus dropped by 21 points from June to August: 55% approved of his handling of the virus, down 10 points from June, while 39% disapproved, which was up by 11 points. His net approval was relatively stable elsewhere - dropping between 3 and 5 points over the same period on the economy, immigration and the environment. It is far too early to say how much the recent drop in public approval will affect Biden's party’s chances of retaining control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. But it does show how closely tied Biden's support is to the coronavirus crisis and how vulnerable he would be politically if the rate of infections does not subside. Last year in his campaign against Trump, Biden made bringing the pandemic to an end a centerpiece of his message, pledging a return to a degree of normalcy by this summer. Instead, a wave of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths, largely among those who have refused to get vaccinated, has bedeviled his administration. ""(Biden) owns the coronavirus issue now,"" said Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver. ""A lot of people thought it would be over by now, and instead it’s back."" Seventeen months into the pandemic, many Americans continue to work from home as employers postpone office reopenings in the face of the Delta variant. Mask wearing is widespread again and there are concerns about a further spike in cases as children return to school. ""It seems like we’re losing the battle now"" with the coronavirus, said José Guerra, 62, an independent from Kingsville, Texas, who took the poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,427 U.S. adults, including 2,033 Democrats, 1,531 Republicans and 527 independents. The findings have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 points for independents. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Gilead Sciences wins reversal of $1.2 bln award in patent case with Bristol Myers,2515,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out a $1.2 billion ruling against Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), finding a patent on a cancer therapy it was accused of infringing was invalid, in a blow to rival Bristol Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). The two companies have been embroiled in a case involving accusations that Yescarta, the CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy from Gilead's Kite Pharma unit, infringed on a patent for a similar therapy from Bristol's Juno Therapeutics. Last year, a federal judge increased the damages from a jury trial and ordered Gilead to pay Bristol Myers $1.2 billion in the patent infringement case. The ruling on Thursday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision. Bristol Myers in a statement said it disagreed with latest ruling and would seek a review of the Federal Circuit’s decision. Gilead and Kite's attorney Josh Rosenkranz of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gilead shares were up 0.3%, while Bristol shares were off 0.5% in midday trading. The Gilead drug, Yescarta, belongs to a class of cutting-edge cancer treatments known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T, which reprograms the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. Gilead bought Kite Pharma, which developed Yescarta, for $11.9 billion in 2017, with the treatment securing U.S. approval that year. It recorded sales of $338 million in the first six months of this year. A jury in 2019 found that Kite willfully infringed and awarded Juno and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which licenses the patent to Juno, $778 million. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez increased the award to $1.2 billion in Los Angeles federal court last year. Memorial Sloan Kettering did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bristol Myers acquired Juno and its CAR-T program with its $74 billion purchase of Celgene in 2019. Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel that the relevant parts of Juno’s patent were invalid because they lacked a sufficient written description and details. Moore was joined by Circuit Judges Sharon Prost and Kathleen O'Malley in the ruling. During a July oral argument, Moore compared the patent's description to trying to identify a specific car by saying it has four wheels.

Keeping monetary policy loose can help labor reallocation -paper,1978,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Global central banks could do well to keep interest rates low for as long as possible in order to provide the optimal environment for people to move from industries that have been curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic to those that have thrived, according to an academic paper presented to a premier economic policy conference on Friday. ""We have shown that a desire to facilitate the reallocation process can lead to favor a more expansionary monetary policy,"" wrote lead author Veronica Guerrieri, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, and her team of co-authors in the paper, which was presented to the Kansas City Federal Reserve's annual symposium, held online for the second year running due to COVID-19. A loose monetary policy environment promotes wage inflation in those sectors that are expanding, which in turn ""can facilitate the adjustment of relative wages, so as to provide the right price signals to encourage mobility,"" they wrote. The authors did not directly reference the U.S. Federal Reserve in the paper, but a number of the central bank's top policymakers were expected to be in the online audience The pandemic has upended various industries in the United States, with businesses reporting worker shortages and the need to increase wages to attract applicants. Supply chain constraints during a period of high demand have also caused a spike in inflation, which is currently well above the central bank's 2% average goal. Despite a bump in overall wage growth in the second quarter to the fastest pace in 13 years on an annual basis, real wages have been negative for the last four months amid overall price pressures. Federal Reserve policymakers are keenly watching broad inflation measures, even as they strive to help the economy recoup jobs lost due to the health crisis, as they mull when to begin reducing their extraordinary support of the economy.

Global policymakers urge more sharing of COVID-19 vaccine,1075,"WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - A group of global policymakers tasked with responding to the COVID-19 health crisis on Friday urged nations with large vaccine stocks to share them with programs that distribute them to lower-income counties. In a joint statement, the Multilateral Leaders Taskforce - which includes the heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization - said fewer than 2% of adults in most low-income countries were vaccinated, compared with almost 50% in high-income countries. ""This crisis of vaccine inequity is driving a dangerous divergence in COVID-19 survival rates and in the global economy,"" the group said. It called on the Group of Seven nations - the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom - to ""urgently"" fulfill their vaccine-sharing pledges, noting that fewer than 10% of pledged doses have been shipped. The group also urged nations to eliminate export restrictions on COVID-19 vaccines. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Poland to offer COVID booster shots to people with reduced immunity,1309,"WARSAW, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Poland will give third doses of COVID-19 vaccine to people with weak immune systems, the health minister said on Friday, as the European Union's biggest eastern member braces for a fourth wave that is already hitting its western neigbours. At around 200 a day, Poland's daily COVID-19 case numbers are a fraction of what they were during the third wave in spring. But with the highly contagious Delta variant already contributing to a rise in infections the country expects the situation to deteriorate in autumn. ""(The Medical Council) accepts the use of a third dose for people with reduced immunity and for now we will dedicate third doses to people who have reduced immunity,"" Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. He said that the third doses would be made available from Sept 1. Poland, a nation of around 38 million people, has fully vaccinated 18.6 million people. However, the number of people coming forward to be vaccinated has decreased over the summer. There is no consensus among scientists and international agencies that a third dose is necessary, but several countries including the United States, Israel, Germany and France have already opted to offer them to older adults and those with weak immune systems.

"Air China, China Southern narrow quarterly losses as travel rebounds",2422,"BEIJING/SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Air China (601111.SS) and China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) on Friday narrowed losses in the second quarter after a hit from low Lunar New Year traffic, but domestic COVID-19 outbreaks and border closures are set to weigh on the rest of the year. Chinese airline stocks had tumbled following domestic COVID-19 outbreaks in late July that locked down some cities and closed airports, but rebounded recently as China has nearly halted local spread. On Thursday, the city of Nanjing, locked down since late July, resumed commercial flights. Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist destination, will also reopen its airport on Aug. 30, an airport official told Reuters. Third-quarter results will take a hit from the flight cuts, though they were less severe than in the first quarter when outbreaks restricted travel during the normally peak Lunar New Year holiday. Beijing-based Air China, the country's flag carrier, said its net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to 578 million yuan ($89.27 million) from 6.2 billion yuan in the first quarter, taking first-half net loss to 6.8 billion yuan. China Southern Airlines trimmed its loss to 682 million yuan from 4.0 billion yuan in the first quarter for first-half total shortfall of a 4.7 billion yuan. Second-half earnings are expected to receive a boost from the pent-up domestic travel demand during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the week-long National Holiday in the fourth quarter, as health experts expect current outbreaks in China to be contained by end-August. Unlike in most markets, China's domestic capacity has rebounded past pre-COVID levels and airlines have added widebody planes on some local flights because international borders remain closed. Zhong Nanshan, a coronavirus expert who helped shape China's COVID-19 response, told local media that vaccination rate in China is expected to reach 80% by the end of this year. However, despite the higher vaccination rate, hopes for the reopening of Chinese borders have been delayed as Beijing pushes ahead with its ""zero-tolerance"" approach while other countries are learning to live with COVID.

U.S. judge declines to stop J&J from splitting talc liabilities from main business,5011,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge declined to stop Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) from taking steps to offload widespread Baby Powder liabilities from the rest of its business, preserving the option for the healthcare company to move thousands of claims from people who used its talc products to a unit that would file for bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein denied a request from plaintiffs' lawyers to block the move late Thursday. Lawyers for cancer victims wanted her to issue a restraining order against J&J as part of her role overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of one of the company's former talc suppliers. J&J is exploring a plan to move its liabilities from widespread Baby Powder and other talc-related litigation into a newly created business that would later seek bankruptcy protection, Reuters previously reported. The company's talc products are currently housed in a subsidiary called Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. read more ""The court rightly denied the plaintiffs' motion aimed at preventing J&J from engaging in legitimate business transactions, in the event that it chooses to do so,"" said Diane Sullivan, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP lawyer representing J&J, in a statement. The legal skirmish was unusual in that plaintiffs' lawyers were asking the judge to forbid J&J from taking steps the company's lawyers said it had not yet decided whether to pursue. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has previously said it has ""not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate."" The judge is overseeing the bankruptcy case of Imerys Talc America, which once supplied talc to J&J and filed for Chapter 11 court protection amid mounting litigation. Imerys and J&J have since been battling one another over whether J&J is required to cover the former supplier's legal costs under indemnification agreements. Plaintiffs' lawyers argued that allowing J&J to offload its talc liabilities to a unit that would file for bankruptcy would harm Imerys' reorganization. The judge decided it would be improper as part of Imerys' bankruptcy case for her to legally bar J&J from undertaking a hypothetical future restructuring that might result in separating the talc liabilities. She said Imerys could take legal action against J&J should J&J decide to separate its talc liabilities in a way Imerys deems harmful or unlawful. TEXAS TWO-STEP BANKRUPTCY J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. J&J is considering using Texas' ""divisive merger"" law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities, Reuters previously reported. For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation. The maneuver is known among legal experts as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used in recent years. Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company. Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities. A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free. The blue-chip company, which boasts a market value exceeding $450 billion, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J's appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company's talc caused their ovarian cancer. read more Separately, plaintiffs lawyers are seeking a similar restraining order against J&J in a Missouri court. One of those lawyers, Andy Birchfield, said in a statement that he and other lawyers would study the Imerys ruling and continue attempts to prevent J&J from using the Texas law to separate its talc liabilities and steer them toward bankruptcy.

U.S. Supreme Court ends CDC's pandemic residential eviction moratorium,2743,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions imposed by President Joe Biden's administration in a challenge to the policy brought by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups. The justices, who in June had left in place a prior ban that expired at the end of July, granted a request by the challengers to lift the moratorium by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that was to have run until Oct. 3. Also read: White House calls for 'urgent' action to prevent evictions after Supreme Court decision The challengers argued that the law on which the CDC relied did not allow it to implement the current ban. ""It strains credulity to believe that this statute grants the CDC the sweeping authority that it asserts,"" the court said in an unsigned opinion. ""If a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it,"" the court added. The three liberal justices on the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, all dissented. The White House said it was disappointed by the decision and urged states, local governments, landlords and Cabinet agencies to ""urgently act"" to help prevent evictions. read more The high court had signaled in June that it thought the moratorium was on shaky legal ground, and that such a policy needed to be enacted by Congress rather than being imposed unilaterally by the executive branch. The CDC first issued a moratorium in September 2020 after a prior one approved by Congress expired, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic. Under political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration on Aug. 3 implemented a somewhat narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said in a dissenting opinion that the outcome of the case was not as clear cut as the majority suggested and that the court was not justified in ending the moratorium so quickly at a time when COVID-19 cases are surging. ""The public interest strongly favors respecting the CDC’s judgment at this moment, when over 90 percent of counties are experiencing high transmission rates,"" Breyer wrote. Citing the CDC, he said that a surge of evictions could lead to more infections of the coronavirus. The latest moratorium covered nearly 92% of U.S. counties - those deemed to have ""substantial"" and ""high"" levels of coronavirus transmission. The policy was challenged in federal court by realtor associations in Alabama and Georgia as well as landlords in those two states. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Danish government intervenes to end nurses strike,1398,"COPENHAGEN, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Danish lawmakers on Friday voted through an emergency law which will effectively end a strike among more than 6,000 nurses over pay which has postponed tens of thousands operations and other treatments. More than a tenth of Denmark's nurses went on strike in mid-June after union members voted against a pay deal that their union leadership had approved. read more The emergency law, which was passed on Friday by a majority in parliament, effectively forces through the 5.02% wage increase over the next three years, which the nurses themselves had already rejected. ""I am deeply disappointed that the parliament is ending the conflict, but not taking the necessary political responsibility to rectify decades of unfair wages,” the head of the nurses’ union Grete Christensen said in a statement. Such an intervention is rare in the Nordic country, where agreements on wages and other working conditions traditionally are negotiated by unions and employers through collective bargaining. Denmark has practically avoided a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, easing pressure on an overstretched health service. However, the strike has so far postponed roughly 35,500 surgeries, The Danish Health Authority said on Wednesday, adding that it can take as long as two years to bring down the extraordinary backlog.

Fed Chair Powell's big moment and 3 ways he could play it,5871,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The stakes for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he delivers a speech on Friday, his fourth at the influential Jackson Hole economic symposium hosted each August by the Kansas City Fed, could not be much higher. Investors and traders will hang on his every word, from his assessment of the progress in the labor market and his outlook for inflation, to any details on when and how he'd expect to start trimming the central bank's support for the economy. Perhaps even more importantly, his words will be scrutinized by a White House considering whether to keep him for another four years, or nominate another leader to take over when his term expires in February. ""It’s an opportunity for him. If he really impresses people that he’s on top of all this, then that could really smooth the way for his reappointment,"" says Dartmouth College's Andrew Levin, an adviser to former Chair Janet Yellen and who in recent weeks has publicly advocated for a change in Fed leadership. Yellen, who is now Treasury Secretary, has reportedly told senior advisers to President Joe Biden that she backs reappointing Powell. read more Here are three approaches Powell may take in his speech: UNEVEN OUTLOOK The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has set off a fourth wave of the pandemic in the United States, and for some regions - like much of the South - it has become the worst yet. Assessing its impact is one way Powell could go. For example, infections, hospitalizations and deaths in Florida, the country's fourth-largest state economy, are all at record highs. High-frequency data indicators of consumer behavior show marked drop-offs in restaurant bookings and retail foot traffic there. Still, those declines more likely represent ""a loss of momentum rather than a pullback in economic activity,"" Jefferies Chief Financial Economist Aneta Markowska wrote this week. That dovetails with the line Powell and his colleagues have taken this summer: that consumers and businesses have learned to navigate the riskier health environment. Nearly 1.9 million jobs were created in June and July, though that pace may have moderated in August. Still, many economists expect employment to fully recoup the 22 million jobs lost to COVID shutdowns in 2020 by next year. Overall, the economy has more than retraced the drop in output, and while some economists have lowered estimates for the current quarter, they are merely shifting growth into later periods rather than wiping it off the board. Nodding to all that would put Powell in position to reiterate that the Fed is making progress - perhaps ""substantial further progress"" - toward its goals of full employment and 2% inflation. Clearing that hurdle sets the stage for the start of the ""taper"" later this year, when the Fed is expected to slow its $120 billion a month of bond purchases aimed at keeping rates low and supporting the economy. TAPER TALK Powell may decide to use the speech to shape expectations around when and how the taper may play out. A number of the Fed's more hawkish policymakers engaged in their own effort on that score Thursday, with the heads of three regional banks all stumping for a quick start to the taper. Other policymakers have previously said they'd prefer to see a few more months of data, given the Delta surge. read more Fed policymakers meet to discuss their next moves in mid-September. Even if he doesn't offer any new details, Powell may take the opportunity to remind investors that a reduction in asset purchases is separate from an interest rate hike. The Fed has set separate hurdles for that, and Powell has previously said those will not be met for quite a while. With inflation already running well above target, a growing number of policymakers concerned it may not recede as quickly or definitively as previously expected, and employment still well short of the labor market's true capacity, the Fed may face tough choices ahead. read more IT'S THE FRAMEWORK, STUPID Powell could push back against emerging criticism of the new framework, which allows for more tolerance for above-target inflation in deference to allowing the economy to run ""hot"" long enough to foster the kind of robust labor market that had taken hold just before the pandemic. Powell unveiled the framework at last year's Jackson Hole conference when the biggest threat to recovery was seen to be the enormous jobs hole left by COVID. Few, if any, policymakers imagined inflation - then running at barely half their target - would emerge so quickly as a force to be reckoned with, perhaps at the expense of completing their work helping the job market fully rebound. Powell could argue that jobs and inflation are not in conflict, that they are not on course for an either-or moment when policymakers must sacrifice the one to contain the other. Many of the factors driving inflation now do appear connected to the task of restarting a $20 trillion economy, and some - like used car prices - are already showing signs of moderating. Moreover, even those inside the Fed most anxious about inflation concede the last several months of rapid price increases have not resulted in a material lift to inflation expectations, which should anchor a return to a more palatable inflation situation. Even this approach comes with some risk, potentially leaving Powell to look defensive about rather than confident in his new policy blueprint. And addressing the issue at all could be a tacit acknowledgement of a deeper debate underway. On the first anniversary of the framework, though, it's arguably the moment for a full-throated defense of a change in monetary policy that will define Powell's legacy if it works, and which has been a key reason even some of the most progressive allies of Biden support his renomination.

Experts recommend booster COVID shots for higher-risk groups in China-official,948,"BEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Experts in China have recommended making booster COVID-19 doses available to specific groups, such as employees at higher risk of exposure to the virus and those who have weak immunity or are aged above 60, a health official said on Friday. These people should get booster shot six months after completing their regular vaccination regimens, Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission, told a news briefing. Zheng did not say whether China has already started giving booster shots, or when it would start. Booster doses were appropriate for people working in the aviation industry, customs, borders, quarantine sites and specific medical institutions, as well as those who travel abroad to places where the virus is still spreading, Zheng said. Further studies were needed to determine whether booster shots should be given to everyone, Zheng said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand keeps curbs until next week to beat Delta; Auckland shut for longer,3315,"WELLINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand on Friday extended pandemic restrictions by four days after which they will be eased slightly, although businesses and schools will remain shut and the biggest city Auckland will be locked down for longer. New Zealand had been largely virus-free, barring a small number of cases in February, but that changed last week after an outbreak of the Delta coronavirus variant erupted, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a nationwide lockdown. The outbreak, which has so far infected nearly 350 people, may be reaching its peak, Ardern said at a news conference. ""We may be seeing the beginning of a plateau of cases,"" Ardern said. ""But caution is still required."" She ordered all of New Zealand, except Auckland and Northland, the country's northernmost region, to move one step lower to alert level 3 restrictions from Wednesday, Sept. 1. This means businesses can only operate for online orders and contactless services, and bars and restaurants remain shut except for takeaways. Public venues remain closed, while the number of people at weddings and funerals are limited to 10 people. ""Yes, you might be able to order some food, but there is not a lot more in terms of freedoms,"" Ardern acknowledged. Meanwhile, nearly 2 million people residing in Auckland and neighbouring Northland will remain in full level 4 lockdown, possibly for another 2 weeks, Ardern said. BUSINESSES DISAPPOINTED A vaccination centre sign directs the public during a lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Auckland, New Zealand, August 26, 2021. REUTERS/Fiona Goodall The country reported 70 new cases of COVID-19 in the community on Friday, all in the epicentre Auckland, taking the total number of cases to 347. Ardern's tough lockdowns and international border closure in March 2020 helped rein in COVID-19, but the government now faces questions over a delayed vaccine rollout, as well as rising costs in a country heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce. Just about 21% of the country's 5.1 million people has been fully vaccinated, the slowest pace among the wealthy nations of the OECD grouping. Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Leeann Watson said the lockdown extension was ""disappointing"". ""While the government absolutely has to weigh any decision-making with the impact on public health, the reality is that ongoing lockdowns cannot be part of our long-term future,"" Watson said. Mike Toweel, the founder of LED Display and Sign Specialist firm VitrineMedia NZ, told Reuters the lockdowns have been ""heartbreaking"" for small businesses. ""We are all stakeholders in the New Zealand economy,"" Toweel said in a phone interview from Sydney. The Australian has been unable to return to New Zealand due to the border restrictions. ""What the New Zealand government does not address is that every time they have this knee-jerk reaction they put another chink in the armour of business confidence."" Ardern has defended the government's position, saying elimination was the right strategy until everyone is vaccinated. ""Our goal at the moment is to vaccinate more people than any other country in the world and at this rate New Zealand is doing very well,"" she said.

French consumer confidence holding up despite COVID curbs,1987,"PARIS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - French consumers were only marginally less confident about their economic prospects in August despite a surge in coronavirus cases and new rules requiring a health pass to enter many retail outlets, a monthly survey showed on Friday. The INSEE official statistics agency said its monthly consumer confidence index fell to 99 from 100 in July, just short of the average expectation for 100 in a Reuters poll of 10 economists. The index had peaked at 102 in June - the highest since the pandemic started - as vaccination rates picked up and coronavirus restrictions were eased. But with France now facing its fourth coronavirus wave as the Delta variant spreads, the government began requiring people earlier this month to show proof of vaccination to enter cafes, restaurants, trains and big shopping malls. Nonetheless, the survey found that the proportion of households considering that it is a good time to make large purchases remained stable in August above the long-term average while saving intentions rose for the first time in three months. Concerns about unemployment were also unchanged from July with 'help wanted' signs increasingly popping up as companies face growing trouble finding staff. The share of households expecting prices to rise in the coming months rose slightly as strained supply chains increasingly leave firms little choice but to raise their prices. The relatively small decline in consumer confidence suggests that at least for now the new health pass is having a limited impact on economic activity even though it has fuelled regular weekend protests across the country. After a stronger than expected first half of the year, French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday the bank could raise its 2021 growth forecast of 5.75% when it updates its estimates next month, adding that economic impact from the Delta variant was expected to be limited.

Hundreds of displaced families seek food and shelter in Kabul,2513,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Afghan families who have been camping in searing heat at a Kabul park after the Taliban overran their provinces begged for food and shelter on Thursday, the most visible face of a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the war-torn country. The Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan this month, culminating in the capture of Kabul on Aug. 15, has thrown the country into turmoil. read more While thousands of people have crowded the airport to try to flee, many others, like the families in the park, are stuck in limbo, unsure whether it is safer to try to go home or stay where they are. ""I'm in a bad situation,"" said Zahida Bibi, a housewife, sitting under the blazing sun with her large family. ""My head hurts. I feel very bad, there is nothing in my stomach."" Ahmed Waseem, displaced from northern Afghanistan said those in the park were hoping the central government would pay attention. ""We are in an open field and in the heat,"" he said. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters the group was not providing food to the people at the park and others at the airport because it would lead to further overcrowding. They should return to their homes, he said. Afghanistan's western-backed president and many other officials fled after government forces melted away in the face of the Taliban advance. The group has placed its members in ministries and ordered some officials back to work, but services are yet to resume, with banks still closed. read more Phalwan Sameer, also from northern Afghanistan, said his family came to Kabul after the situation rapidly deteriorated in his home town.

EXCLUSIVE U.S. urges Mexico to clear migrant camps near border -sources,2689,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The United States has urged Mexico to clear ad-hoc camps housing thousands of migrants in border cities due to concerns they pose a security risk and attract criminal gangs, officials familiar with the matter said. Facing domestic criticism over a jump in illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has pressed Mexico to curb the flow of migrants to help ease pressure on the nearly 2,000 mile (3,200 km) frontier. Two of the biggest camps to have sprung up in northern Mexico are in the city of Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, and in Tijuana, opposite San Diego, California. Government officials and migrant advocates say the Reynosa camp is home to at least 2,500 people, is unsanitary and has drawn drug gang members looking to recruit desperate migrants. The Tijuana camp is of a similar size, rights groups say. For weeks, the U.S. government has been asking Mexico to clear the camps, in part because the sheer volume of people in them could jeopardize security if they made a sudden rush for the border, two officials familiar with the matter said. Asylum-seeking migrants are pictured at a makeshift camp after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered to uphold an immigration policy implemented under former President Donald Trump that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings, at El Chaparral crossing port with the U.S., in Tijuana, Mexico August 25, 2021. REUTERS/Jorge Duenes/ The State Department and the White House declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. Mexico's Foreign Ministry did not reply to requests for comment. The National Migration Institute declined to comment. The officials emphasized the importance of eradicating conditions that encouraged cartel members to try to extort migrants, or to pressure them into joining their ranks. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Biden to comply with a Texas-based federal judge's ruling to revive a Trump administration immigration policy that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings. That has alarmed Mexican officials, who are concerned the country will struggle to cope with more people after the number of apprehensions or expulsions by U.S. agents of migrants crossing the border more than doubled this year. Mexican authorities have stepped up efforts to expel migrants in the country illegally, many from Central America. In the past few weeks it has sent thousands of them to southern Mexico by plane in order to speed up the process. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
WHO begins shipping Chinese vaccines despite some misgivings,4495,"BRUSSELS/JOHANNESBURG/JAKARTA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's pandemic programme plans to ship 100 million doses of the Sinovac (SVA.O) and Sinopharm COVID-19 shots by the end of next month, mostly to Africa and Asia, in its first delivery of Chinese vaccines, a WHO document shows. The Chinese shipments will help the sputtering global COVAX vaccine sharing programme which is far behind its pledge to deliver 2 billion doses this year following supply problems and export curbs imposed by major producer India. It could also boost Beijing's vaccine diplomacy efforts despite concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese shots, which have been turned down or paired with boosters from Western manufacturers by some of the recipient countries. Of the 100 million Chinese vaccines, half will be provided by Sinopharm and half by Sinovac, with deliveries planned for ""July to September 2021"", a WHO document dated July 29 says. About 10 million Sinopharm shots had been shipped by mid-August, a spokesperson for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), which co-leads COVAX along with the WHO, told Reuters. Sinopharm, Sinovac and China's trade ministry did not respond to requests for comment about when the Chinese vaccines would be delivered. The Chinese vaccines have been allocated to 60 countries, mostly in Africa, which is expected to receive a third of the 100 million doses. However, not all countries want the Chinese vaccines. South Africa is listed by COVAX as one of Africa's largest recipients of Chinese shots with an allocation of 2.5 million Sinovac doses, but a senior health official told Reuters the country was currently unable to accept the vaccines. ""There is not enough information on effectiveness against the Delta variant and there is no data on Sinovac in populations with HIV,"" said Nicholas Crisp, a deputy director-general in the health department who is overseeing the vaccine rollout. ""We have not accepted the COVAX Sinovac because it is premature in our evaluation and planning process,"" he told Reuters. Sinovac did not immediately respond to a request for comment about South Africa's stance. Nigeria, the main recipient of Chinese shots in Africa under COVAX with an allocation of nearly 8 million Sinopharm doses, has approved that vaccine but has called it a ""potential"" option for the country's inoculation campaign. BOOSTERS TO CHINESE SHOTS A GAVI spokesperson declined to comment on South Africa and Nigeria and noted that other countries had not been included in this round, with one of the reasons being that some had decided not to receive the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. Officials from Kenya, Rwanda, Togo and Somalia, which are entitled to smaller COVAX shipments, said they had no concerns about the Chinese shots because they had been vetted by the WHO and more people needed to be inoculated as soon as possible. COVAX's allocation of Chinese vaccines comes after the WHO gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm shot in May and Sinovac in June. GAVI has secured a combined supply of up to 550 million vaccines from the two companies until next year. Including the Chinese vaccines, the facility expects to deliver about 500 million doses by the end of September, its latest forecast shows. It has so far shipped 215 million vaccines, mostly AstraZeneca's (AZN.L). read more Ukraine is the only country in Europe on the COVAX list for Chinese shots and is set to receive about 160,000 Sinovac doses. Asian countries are expected to receive more than 25 million Chinese vaccines, of which nearly 11 million Sinovac doses would go to Indonesia, making it the largest recipient of Chinese shots through COVAX. Other vaccines will go to countries in Latin America and the Middle East. Indonesia has decided to give boosters, largely with the Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine, to healthcare workers - who have mostly been immunised with Sinovac shots. That mirrored similar moves in other countries that have deployed Sinovac shots, such as Brazil and Chile. Healthcare workers are a small portion of those vaccinated in Indonesia, but the booster policy has been interpreted by many as a sign of decreasing confidence in Sinovac. Asked why Indonesia was buying the vaccine, of which the country is a major recipient also through bilateral deals, an official at the Indonesian health ministry told Reuters: ""Sinovac could assure us of the amount they could deliver.""

"Malaysia's new PM retains finance minister, senior figures in cabinet",3625,"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob unveiled his cabinet on Friday, re-appointing the finance minister and several others from the previous administration, in the hope of restoring political stability amid a COVID-19 crisis. Ismail Sabri was sworn in as prime minister last week, succeeding Muhyiddin Yassin who had resigned after failing to cling onto a razor-thin majority in parliament. read more He takes charge as public anger grows over the government's floundering attempts to contain a surge in COVID-19 cases and revive an economy battered by extended lockdowns, with the central bank slashing its 2021 growth forecast twice this year. Ismail Sabri named as finance minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz, who had held the post in Muhyiddin's administration. He also named four senior ministers to head the international trade, defence, works and education portfolios, all of whom had served in the previous government. ""The formation of this cabinet is a re-formulation based on the current situation, in order to maintain stability and prioritising the interests and safety of the Malaysian people above all,"" Ismail Sabri said in a televised address. He said each ministry will need to prove its early achievements within the first 100 days, adding that the government aimed to reopen economic activities in stages with the coronavirus expected to become endemic. The Southeast Asian nation has the highest per capita COVID-19 infection rate in the region, with more than 1.6 million reported cases, including 15,211 deaths. On Thursday, it reported a daily record of 24,599 new coronavirus cases and 393 fatalities. Vaccination rates, however, have ramped up. Nearly half of Malaysia's 32 million population are fully vaccinated, including 60.2% of all adults. Khairy Jamaluddin, who had spearheaded Malaysia's inoculation programme as science minister, will now be in charge of the health ministry, swapping portfolios with Adham Baba, who will oversee the vaccine roll-out next, Ismail Sabri said. The presence of familiar figures in the cabinet line-up raised doubts on whether the new administration will be up to the task of avoiding the previous government's mistakes, amid public fury over its flip-flopping lockdown policies and failure to act against politicians who violated rules. ""It's not a reformulated cabinet, it's a sort of mutually reshuffled cabinet in the sense with the same old faces, mutually exchanging some ministerial portfolios,"" said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore's Institute of International Affairs. ""I don't keep a lot of hope on this new cabinet being able to perform any better than the last cabinet, because they are the same old people."" Ismail Sabri's appointment saw the return of his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to the top office, after it was toppled in an election three years ago amid widespread corruption allegations. He is Malaysia's third prime minister since the 2018 polls, after UMNO pulled its backing for Muhyiddin last month, citing his failure to manage the pandemic. Analysts have said Ismail Sabri could face instability as well, with continued infighting within UMNO while coalition partners such as Muhyiddin's alliance have said its support for the new premier was conditional on him taking a strong stand against graft. Several UMNO leaders were charged with corruption after the election, including president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and former premier Najib Razak, who remain influential figures within the party.

Japan's July factory output to fall as Delta variant spreads in Asia: Reuters poll,2050,"TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output likely fell in July as export demand for capital goods stagnated and supply chains were further disrupted by the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant in Asia, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. The poll also showed retail sales, a key barometer of consumer spending, were expected to post a fifth straight month of year-on-year gains in July, helped by growing demand for electronics and clothing. Factory output was projected to have fallen 2.5% from the previous month in the poll of 18 economists, dropping into contraction after a sharp 6.5% jump in June, the highest growth since July 2020. ""With the chip shortage issue, the global spread of the Delta variant and particularly its impact on parts supply from Southeast Asia puts pressure on production"" by Japanese manufacturers, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities attributed the expected output drop to weak Asia-bound machinery exports, while adding that a recovery in car production was likely to offset some of the decline. For retail sales, analysts in the poll forecast growth of 2.1% from the same month a year earlier, picking up speed after a 0.1% increase in June. But pressure from the health crisis was likely to remain a drag on consumption trends, with the year-on-year figure expected to be skewed due to statistical base effects reflecting last year's slide.

The ""zero draft"" of the declaration, published on the official website of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity on Thursday, includes the key Chinese Communist Party concept of ""ecological civilisation"". It also includes the formulation of ""lucid water and lush mountains"", first used in a 2005 speech by President Xi Jinping and included in dozens of Chinese policy documents and propaganda campaigns since he became leader in 2012. The document also calls on parties to ""mainstream"" biodiversity protection in decisionmaking, and recognise the importance of conservation in protecting human health - a prominent theme among China's leaders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been blamed on wildlife trading and ecosystem destruction. China wants the international community to sign the declaration during the virtual Kunming talks on Oct. 11, with the aim of building a consensus behind a more detailed global treaty to be finalised in person next May. Governments have been invited to give their ""feedback"" to the draft before Sept. 6, according to a covering letter sent to the United Nations by Chinese environment minister Huang Runqiu. ""Ambition will need to be built up over the next month,"" said Li Shuo, senior climate advisor with the environment group Greenpeace in Beijing. ""As the technical negotiations sink deeper in the mud, the Declaration should help forge the consensus that technocrats are unable to,"" he added.

YouTube suspends payments to Brazilian accounts over election disinformation,1535,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - YouTube said on Thursday it had suspended payments to content producers from 14 channels accused of spreading fake news about next year's election by the country's federal electoral court, the TSE. Most of the channels offer regular full-throated support to President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has been sowing doubts about the credibility of next year's vote. The president is down in the polls after overseeing the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak and a weak economy. ""We reinforce our commitment to collaborating with the work of authorities in Brazil and to continue to invest in policies, resources and products to protect the YouTube community from harmful content,"" Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube said in a statement announcing the move. Last week, the inspector general of electoral justice, Luis Felipe Salomão, ordered YouTube, Twitch.TV, Twitter (TWTR.N), Instagram and Facebook (FB.O) to suspend payments to people and pages that were spreading disinformation about the Brazilian electoral system. In July, YouTube said it had removed videos from Bolsonaro's channel for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, becoming the latest tech giant to pull his pandemic pronouncements. Last year, both Twitter and Facebook took down videos of Bolsonaro for breaching their terms of use after he made pronouncements that went against the recommendations of global public health experts.

Mexican researchers say they created facemask that neutralizes COVID-19,1421,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) have created a facemask using silver and copper nanolayers that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the university's official gazette said on Thursday. UNAM is calling the triple-layered antimicrobial facemask SakCu; Sak means silver in Mayan and Cu is the chemical symbol for copper. To test the mask, researchers took drops with the virus from COVID-19-positive patients at the Hospital Juarez in Mexico and placed them on the silver-copper film deposited in polypropylene. UNAM said that if the viral concentration was high, the virus disappeared by more than 80% in about eight hours and if the viral load was low, in two hours none of the virus RNA was detected. ""Upon contact with the silver-copper nanolayer, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane breaks and its RNA is damaged,"" the gazette said. ""Thus, even if SakCu is disposed of improperly, it will not be a problem as it does not remain contaminated, like many of the masks that are thrown away."" The facemask is reusable and can be washed up to 10 times without losing its biocide properties. UNAM is not mass-producing the facemask and said that it currently has the capacity to produce 200 of them per day. The research was led by UNAM's Materials Research Institute. It has not been peer reviewed. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Peru's Congress pushes Cabinet confirmation vote to Friday, extending uncertainty",3641,"LIMA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Peru's Congress on Thursday pushed back to Friday a key vote to confirm or reject a new leftist Cabinet nominated by President Pedro Castillo, extending the uncertainty in a country where conflicts between the executive and legislature loom large. Castillo, who took office just last month, is Peru's fifth president in five years due to those tensions, which included several impeachment proceedings against previous leaders. The vote of confidence is a key test for his fledging presidency. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Guido Bellido asked Congress for a ""yes"" vote and outlined plans to lift Peru out of ""one of the most grave political, social, environmental and health crises of recent decades."" Bellido began his speech in quechua, the most common indigenous language in Peru, which prompted the head of the legislature to ask him to speak in Spanish because she could not understand him. Castillo won a deeply divisive election this year, beating his rival by a margin of 0.25 percentage point. But he won overwhelming support in quechua-speaking parts of the country. . Lawmakers publicly debated throughout the afternoon, although it was not possible in many cases to know which way they would vote. It is still unclear whether the Cabinet will be confirmed or not. Castillo belongs to the Marxist-Leninist Free Peru party, which is allied to a more moderate leftist group in Congress. But put together they hold only a third of all votes. They need a simple majority for confirmation. In the not unlikely event that the Cabinet is rejected by the center-right coalition that runs Peru's Congress, Castillo will have to present a new Cabinet led by a new prime minister. But if Congress rejects this second Cabinet as well, Castillo would have the option to close Congress instead, while keeping his Cabinet in place. ""I wish to ratify the commitment of President Castillo to develop public policies and actions that herald a new stage in the life of the country where peace, democracy and equal opportunities for all prevail,"" said Bellido, promising ""important changes in economic and state structures."" As Bellido spoke, dozens of people demonstrated outside both in favor of and against Castillo's Cabinet, in a sign of the country's persistent political divide. POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS Bellido offered several policy announcements in his speech, including that Peru will step up efforts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and asked for legislative powers for the executive on tax matters. He said the government intends to tap the excess profits of mining companies at times of high international prices of raw materials. Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer and mining is the engine of the Andean country's economy. Among projects the government would push, he added, was a railway running from the Andes to the Pacific to carry passengers and mining goods, to be funded through a public-private alliance with international partners. Bellido, who is also Cabinet chief, addressed Congress amid calls for his resignation and those of other members of the government who belong to the Peru Libre party, which brought Castillo to power. He faces an investigation into an alleged ""apology for terrorism"" over old Facebook posts in which he appeared to defend a former rebel from the Shining Path Maoist group. Bellido denies the accusation and no charges have been filed. Government sources had suggested that Castillo would seek to reshuffle his Cabinet in a bid to stave off its rejection by Congress, but in the end no changes were made.

Court sends Calif. regulators back to drawing board on ozone pollution plan,3743,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday mostly sided with a group of California residents by ruling the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) arbitrarily approved a state-level ozone pollution back-up plan for the San Joaquin Valley that the residents say is too weak. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent back to the EPA its 2019 approval of California's plan for meeting federal air-quality standards for ozone in the valley located southeast of San Francisco. The court found that the EPA did not reasonably explain under the Clean Air Act (CAA) why it found the plans' reliance on a measure that would, if all else failed, cut the sales of a paint that contributes to ozone formation was a sufficient plan B. EPA spokesperson Ken Labbe said the agency is reviewing the decision. Brent Newell, a lawyer for the plaintiff, the Association of Irritated Residents (AIR), said: ""The EPA has failed to ensure that Californians have meaningful air-pollution controls and the court has recognized how severe the air-pollution problem is for Valley residents."" Ozone's effects on human health -- depending on the level of exposure -- range from causing coughing to aggravating asthma. AIR petitioned the court in 2019. In a filing, it says the San Joaquin Valley is ""one of the most polluted air basins"" nationwide. The EPA in 2012 classified it as an extreme nonattainment area for the 8-hour ozone standard, according to the ruling. The CAA requires that certain plans seeking to cut ozone concentration include additional, back-stop measures, called contingency measures, in the event it fails. The contingency measure local air regulators elected was the elimination of an exemption restricting the sale of architectural paint like aerosolized coatings in containers of one liter or less, the ruling and briefs said. The EPA estimated the move would achieve one ton per day of reductions in volatile organic compounds, which play a significant role in the formation of ozone, a plaintiff's brief says. In its complaint, AIR said that under long-standing EPA policy, contingency measures must achieve more than 11 tons per day of ozone-forming emissions reductions. The EPA countered that the CAA doesn't ""specify the quantity of emission reductions that a contingency measure must provide"" and that ""surplus emissions reductions"" tied to existing programs, like those controlling emissions from cars, should count toward strengthening a contingency plan. U.S. Circuit Judge Eric Miller disagreed. ""Already-implemented measure"" cannot ""be a basis for declining to establish contingency measures,"" he said. The panel, however, rejected AIR's claim that EPA's approval of an additional program, which the agency says strengthens the state's plan, violates the CAA because it is unenforceable. The program is enforceable because it can require the production of a report, the panel said. Miller was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Mark Bennett and, sitting by designation, U.S. District Judge Benita Pearson. The case is AIR v. USEPA, et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-71223.

China reports 32 new coronavirus cases for Aug 26 vs 26 day ago,746,"BEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China reported 32 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland for Aug. 26, compared with 26 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission on Friday. Two of the new infections were locally transmitted, the health authority said. That compares with three local cases a day earlier. One of the new local cases was found in Shanghai, and the other was in Jiangsu province. China reported 22 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, which it does not classify as confirmed infections. There were 19 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported. As of Aug. 26, mainland China had recorded 94,765 confirmed cases, with a cumulative death toll unchanged at 4,636.

"U.S. payrolls, euro zone inflation, Asian PMIs",3142,"NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. payrolls for August, euro zone inflation and Asia purchasing managers surveys - here's a quick look ahead to next week's top economic events and themes to be covered by Reuters bureaus. UNITED STATES It's all about jobs next week with nonfarm payrolls for August on tap on Friday morning ahead of the long weekend for the Labor Day holiday. Nearly 1.9 million jobs were created in June and July, and it's a toss-up among economists whether that pace can be sustained. The preliminary Reuters estimate pegs jobs growth at 763,000 for August, but watch for updated forecasts early in the week and potentially after Wednesday's ADP's private-sector jobs report. An extension of the previous two months' gains could be enough for Federal Reserve officials to declare they have made ""substantial further progress"" toward maximum employment and price stability goals. That could set up a decision - or at least a more heated debate - on the much-awaited ""tapering"" of the central bank's $120 billion a month of bond purchases at their September meeting. EUROPE In Europe, the most eagerly anticipated news is the first estimate of euro zone inflation for August on Tuesday. Market expectations are for 2.7% year-on-year, above the July figure of 2.2% and moving ever further away from the ECB’s target of close to but not exceeding 2%. Still, it is unlikely that this alone will prompt a re-think of the current ECB view that price pressures are transitory and that stimulus policies can continue well into next year. The German economy, the region’s largest, has been producing mixed signals of late with downbeat business and consumer morale figures suggesting growing concern about coronavirus infections and the impact of supply chain snags. Wednesday’s retail sales index for July may do little to brighten the picture with most analysts expecting a sharp fall from the bounce they got the month before – and some analysts even expecting a fall month-on-month. Britain meanwhile has been suffering more than most from supply and labour shortages as COVID-19 and semiconductor-related factors are compounded by a post-Brexit exodus of skilled workers. The final and complete read-out of Markit/CIPS index of Purchase Managers’ views of the economy – both for manufacturing and services – in August may offer further clues to its overall health on Friday. ASIA Purchasing managers index surveys highlight the agenda in Asia next week, and they may show if the factory closure woes that have been afflicting the region as the Delta variant of the coronavirus spreads have materially worsened or improved. It kicks off Tuesday with China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) PMI, which barely registered growth in July and sits at the lowest since January 2020 coming into the month. That is followed on Wednesday by PMI reports across Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Last month's reports showed divisions in the region, with continued strength in Japan and South Korea and Delta-driven slumps across most of Southeast Asia.

Rite Aid settles bellwether opioid case with Ohio counties,3106,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp affiliates have settled claims by two Ohio counties that it contributed to the opioid addiction epidemic, just over a month before the case was set to go to trial. The pharmacy chain operator and Lake and Trumbull counties disclosed the settlement in a motion filed Wednesday in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, to sever Rite Aid from the case. They did not reveal terms of the deal, which must be approved by Lake County Commissioners and Trumbull County Commissioners. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster granted the motion on Thursday. Frank Gallucci of Plevin & Gallucci, a lawyer for the counties, had no immediate comment. Rite Aid and its lawyer Kelly Moore of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The judge is presiding over a multidistrict litigation including more than 3,000 cases over opioids brought by local governments around the country against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies. The two counties' case against Rite Aid and others was chosen as a bellwether, or test case, of public nuisance claims against pharmacies. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc remain as defendants in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 4. The counties accuse them of overlooking red flags that opioids were being illegally diverted. The pharmacies previously reached a settlement with two counties in New York, where another trial is currently under way, but have yet to propose a nationwide settlement of opioid claims against them. They face another trial next year in a case brought by San Franciso. Other defendants in the opioid litigation have moved in recent months to resolve the claims against them. Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the nation's top three drug distributors - McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc - have offered to pay a combined $26 billion to settle local government's claims against them. However, as of Monday, at least six states had not signed on to that deal, putting the full amount in jeopardy. In addition to the pharmacies, drugmakers AbbVie Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Endo International Inc have not reached nationwide opioid settlements. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its creditors, meanwhile, are seeking approval of a settlement in bankruptcy court that the company values at more than $10 billion. The cases are County of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45032, and County of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma LP et al, No. 18-op-45079, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

Pentagon bracing for more attacks after troops killed at Kabul airport,4204,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - American forces in Kabul were bracing for more Islamic State attacks while winding up their evacuation mission, U.S. officials said, as the number of U.S. troops killed in Thursday's suicide bomb attack rose to 13. A U.S. official told Reuters the number of U.S. personnel killed was likely to rise even higher. More than a dozen were wounded. The attack marked the first U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020 and represented the deadliest incident for American troops in the country in a decade. At least two explosions tore through crowds that had thronged the gates of Hamid Karzai International Airport desperate to leave Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power almost two weeks ago ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw American troops after two decades. In a statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility and said one of its suicide bombers had targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army."" Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, told a news briefing the explosions were followed by gunfight. McKenzie said the threat from Islamic State persists alongside ""other active threat streams."" ""We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue - and we're doing everything we can to be prepared,"" McKenzie said. McKenzie added that future potential attacks could include rockets being fired at the airport or car bombs attempting to get in. McKenzie said he saw nothing that would convince him that Taliban forces had let the attack take place. The U.S. military said that in addition to the 13 killed, 18 were injured and in the process of being evacuated on C-17s with surgical units. U.S. officials said one bomb detonated near the airport's Abbey Gate and the other was close to the nearby Baron Hotel. Crowds of people show their documents to U.S. troops outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan August 26, 2021. REUTERS/Stringer RACE AGAINST TIME A massive airlift of U.S. and other foreign nationals and their families as well as some Afghans has been under way since the day before Taliban forces captured Kabul on Aug. 15, capping a swift advance across the country as American and allied troops withdrew. The United States has been racing to carry out the airlift before its military is set to fully withdraw from the country by Aug. 31. McKenzie said the evacuation mission was not going to stop. ""I think we can continue to conduct our mission, even while we are receiving attacks like this,"" McKenzie said, adding that U.S. forces will ""go after"" the perpetrators of Thursday's attack. McKenzie said there were about 1,000 U.S. citizens estimated to be still in Afghanistan. A spokesperson for the State Department said more than two thirds of these Americans had informed it they were taking steps to leave Afghanistan. Islamic State militants have emerged in Afghanistan as enemies both of the West and the Taliban. A 2001 U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban from power after the group had harbored the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The U.S. military death toll in the Afghanistan war since 2001 stood at roughly 2,500. Afghan health officials were quoted as saying 60 civilians died, but it was not clear whether that was a complete count. Video uploaded by Afghan journalists showed dozens of bodies and wounded victims strewn around a canal on the edge of the airport. U.S. officials have said there are about 5,200 American troops providing airport security. The attacks came after the United States and allies had urged Afghans to leave the area around the airport because of a threat by Islamic State. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul a day earlier had advised Americans to avoid traveling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified ""security threats."" The United States and its allies have mounted one of the biggest air evacuations in history, bringing out about 95,700 people, including 13,400 on Wednesday, according to the White House.

Ruling on Purdue Pharma opioid settlement pushed back to next week,2076,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday he now anticipates a ruling on OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan on Wednesday of next week instead of this week because he needs more oral argument on certain issues. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain was originally expected to rule on Friday, Aug. 27. Drain did not specify the issues on which he needs to hear more. If Drain approves the deal, it would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future litigation. The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, would dissolve the drugmaker and shift assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company would be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic in U.S. communities that alleged the company and its owners aggressively marketed the painkiller OxyContin while playing down its abuse and overdose risks. The plan also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks circulated legislation to block such legal releases and urged the Justice Department to appeal the plan, efforts that failed to gain traction. The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid epidemic. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct. The Purdue bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members. The contribution is in the form of cash that would be paid over roughly a decade and value from relinquishing control of charitable institutions. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2nd Circuit won't enjoin New York anti-abortion protesters,2988,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday refused to enter an injunction against anti-abortion protesters who were accused by the state of violating laws meant to ensure patients' access to abortion clinics without interference or harassment. The unanimous panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not address the merit of the case, which Senior Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi said involved ""difficult, unresolved, issues of state law,"" instead finding only that U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon had not abused her discretion in denying the injunction. Calabresi was joined by Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston and Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler. ""It's a very good ruling,"" said Martin Cannon of the Thomas More Society, a lawyer for the protesters. ""The trial court is entitled to considerable discretion when it makes findings of fact."" The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, which had sued the protesters on behalf of patients of the Choices clinic in the New York City borough of Queens, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state sued the 13 protesters in 2017, alleging that protesters crowded women trying to enter the clinic, made death threats to people trying to escort them and blocked their path with posters purportedly of aborted fetuses. It said those actions violated the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, the state's New York State Clinic Access Act and New York City's Access to Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act. Amon in July 2018 rejected the state's motion for an injunction against the protests, saying the state had not shown it would face irreparable harm without one. In March of this year, however, the same 2nd Circuit panel as in Thursday's decision, divided 2-1, vacated Amon's denial of the injunction and ruled in favor of the state on a number of legal issues in the case. Livingston dissented, saying the decision unconstitutionally curtailed protesters' First Amendment right to free speech. The protesters sought rehearing, which the panel granted. In Thursday's ruling, Calabresi did not give details about the reasons for the change. He wrote that while ""some members of this Court might have resolved the matter differently in the first instance,"" Amon had not abused her ""considerable discretion"" in denying the injunction. Therefore, he said, ""we do not deem it appropriate to certify to the New York Court of Appeals or to try to resolve these issues ourselves at the instant preliminary injunction stage."" The case is New York v Griepp et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 18-2454, 18-2623, 18-2627 and 18-2630.

"Tyson Foods offers $10,000 prizes for vaccinated U.S. chicken workers",1410,"CHICAGO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods (TSN.N) said on Thursday it is offering U.S. chicken plant workers the chance to win $10,000 once a week for the next five weeks if they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine lottery is the latest attempt to encourage vaccinations by the country's biggest meat company by sales, as the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus drives an increase in U.S. cases. Tyson employees at nearly 50 chicken facilities are eligible for the prizes, spokesman Derek Burleson said. The company on Aug. 3 mandated that all employees be vaccinated by Nov. 1, though the requirement for unionized plant workers is subject to negotiations with labor unions. read more At that time, about 56,000 employees had already been vaccinated, roughly 47% of Tyson's U.S. workforce of 120,000, according to the company. read more Tyson said on Thursday that discussions with union leaders on the mandate are ongoing. ""We're already in alignment on the need to continue doing everything we can to protect our team members from the health impacts of the COVID-19 virus,"" Burleson said. Tyson is also paying $200 to any employee who gets vaccinated and compensating workers for up to four hours of regular pay if they are vaccinated outside normal work hours or away from a Tyson location, according to the company.

"Brain fog, total exhaustion: One Big Law associate’s COVID battle",4919,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - As law firms grapple with return-to-office plans, Big Law associate Andrew Kinsey offers a powerful example of why rushing back might be unwise. Kinsey has spent the last two weeks fighting a COVID-19 infection, sharing his symptoms in real time in a series of often-alarming tweets. For example, on the seventh day of his illness he wrote, “It took 15 minutes of slowly changing positions, waiting, moving again, waiting ... but I got from the bed to my chair without throwing up or having to rest for 20 minutes. It sounds pathetic, but this is a huge step.” (Kinsey, a litigation associate in Wilmington, Delaware, did not want to name the mega-firm he works for because he was not speaking on its behalf. A quick Google search revealed he works at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.) To be clear, he’s not dying or about to go on a ventilator. He’s fully vaccinated and is now largely recovered from what he figures was a “mild” Delta-variant case. “The vaccine did its job and I have no lung issues,” he said. Still, Kinsey, 38, told me that he’s never been sicker in his life, flagging “profound exhaustion” as his top symptom, as well as “brain fog.” He’s also got a trial in three weeks. Luckily, his firm has a deep bench, and he hasn’t infected any of his colleagues because hey -- they’re all still working remotely. His co-workers have stepped up to cover for him while he’s been recuperating. But what if they were all in the office together, working down the hall from each other and gathering in a conference room for hours-long brainstorming sessions? According to the CDC, the Delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous COVID strains and can be spread by people who are fully vaccinated. It doesn’t take much imagination to envision the virus tearing through an office. Kinsey’s tweets give a sense of how impossible it would have been to soldier on when sick, trial or no trial. For example, last week he offered observations such as, “Getting up to go to the bathroom caused some intense nausea though, so walking more than 5 feet is still too much” and “My goal today is to be able to watch an hour of TV before I need a break. That goal should give a sense of how much this wipes me out.” Kinsey told me that he’s been motivated to share his experience “to give people a birds-eye view of what it looks like to have a mild case of COVID.” He started feeling ill around August 10 and believes he caught the virus from his 8-year-old daughter. She has underlying health conditions and was hospitalized for several days with COVID. (She has since been released.) After spending four days and nights at her bedside, Kinsey tested positive on August 12. “The worst so far has been fever/muscle weakness and brain fog,” he tweeted on the day of his diagnosis. In the throes of his illness, he found that he couldn’t watch certain television shows because they moved too fast. “I try to think and my brain takes a few seconds to start,” Kinsey tweeted. “I have to be honest,” he tweeted shortly after he got sick. “The only thing that really worries me about my COVID is lingering brain fog. My ability to feed my family relies entirely on my brain functioning properly. I have no idea what my firm would do if I suddenly lost 20+% effectiveness. But it worries me.” According to the Cedars-Sinai blog, COVID-19-related ""brain fog"" is not clearly defined, but “people are using the term to describe the constellation of symptoms such as short-term memory loss, poor attention span and fatigue that plagues up to 20% of COVID-19 patients weeks after they have recovered from typical COVID-19 symptoms.” Kinsey is now back at work, and his fogginess has fortunately dissipated, although he still tires more easily. If he’s got one takeaway, it’s this: Get vaccinated. He’s sure his illness would have been worse without the jab, and if more adults get vaccinated, it protects vulnerable children like his daughter who cannot. If telling his COVID story means “even one person decides to get vaccinated or wear a mask,” he said, “it would be worth it.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

(Reuters) - Massachusetts' top state court has ruled that a state law barring retaliation against victims of domestic violence who take time off of work to attend related court hearings or medical appointments still applies when workers do not formally request leave. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in a 5-2 decision on Wednesday revived a lawsuit by Kehle Osborne-Trussell, a nurse who claims Boston Children's Hospital hired and then swiftly fired her after she informed human resources that she planned to enforce a protective order against a person who had abused and was harassing her. Reversing a state judge, the majority held that the state's Domestic Violence and Abuse Leave Act (DVLA) does not require employees to formally request leave, or provide specific dates that they will miss work, for the law's protections to apply. ""A contrary conclusion would be at odds with the remedial purposes of the DVLA to encourage appropriate advance notice and to create a situation in which abuse is not something to remain silent about,"" Justice Dalila Wendlandt wrote for the court. A spokeswoman for the hospital, which is represented by Murphy & Riley, declined to comment. Michael Mason of Bennett & Belfort, who represents Osborne-Trussell, said on Thursday that the ruling should help guide employer's decisionmaking moving forward. ""The Court clarified the extent to which the law protects these vulnerable employees and allows them to get the help they need without fear of losing their jobs,"" Mason said. According to court filings, Osborne-Trussell in late 2018 obtained a harassment prevention order barring her abuser from contacting her or making social media postings that referenced her. The hospital offered Osborne-Trussell a job in February 2019, contingent upon her passing background and licensure checks and passing a medication assessment test. Two weeks later, Osborne-Trussell's abuser posted threats and false statements about her on social media and ""tagged"" the hospital. She reported the incident to local police and to the hospital's human resources department and notified HR that she was pursuing enforcement of the protective order. About two weeks later, the hospital sent Osborne-Trussell a letter terminating her employment six days before she was set to start working, according to court filings. Osborne-Trussell filed a lawsuit in state court accusing the hospital of discriminating and retaliating against her in violation of the DVLA. The hospital moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that Osborne-Trussell was not an ""employee"" under the DVLA because she had never commenced employment with the hospital. And even if the law applied, Osborne-Trussell could not state a claim because she never requested leave related to the harassment, the hospital said. A state judge last year ruled that Osborne-Trussell was the hospital's employee but agreed that she could not pursue a DVLA claim because she never requested leave. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Judicial Court said the hospital's reading of the DVLA would undermine the policy behind the law. Ruling for the hospital could encourage employers to preemptively terminate workers who disclose abuse before they request specific dates for leave, the majority said. Justice Serge Georges in dissent, joined by Justice Frank Gaziano, said the focus of the DVLA ""is on the leave itself, and not simply a reason that could support an eventual request for leave."" The case is Osborne-Trussell v. The Children's Hospital Inc, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, No. SJC-12991.

Hamilton says he and Mercedes in better shape for title run,2211,"SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton said both he and his Mercedes team would be in better shape for the second half of the season but the battle with Red Bull and Max Verstappen would be closer and tougher than ever. The Briton has an eight-point lead over his Dutch rival ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix, a race that starts the second phase and will have plenty of vocal Verstappen fans in attendance. ""It’s going to be close, it’s going to be tough this second half of the season,"" said Hamilton, who could take a record-extending 100th win on Sunday. ""The first half was definitely one of the toughest and I expect it’s going to be pretty much the same in the second half, if not more difficult."" The 36-year-old said he was excited to get back, had missed working with the team and being in the car and did not feel more wary of Verstappen's challenge. Verstappen has won five races to Hamilton's four so far this year and would be comfortably ahead but for collisions and misfortune that have left him with only five points from the past two races. ""As we've got through the season they have got stronger and stronger,"" said Hamilton, whose team have won the last seven successive drivers' and constructors' world championships. ""It’s been harder for us as we have gone on, we had a bit of a difficult patch but we got back in terms of operating to how we have in the past. ""We have definitely upped our game... I have no doubts that we will take another step forward in our processes and how we apply ourselves."" Hamilton's health caused concern at the previous race in Hungary when he feared he might be feeling the effects of 'long COVID' after testing positive for the virus in Bahrain last November. He was reluctant to divulge personal health information on Thursday but said he had spent the break ensuring he was in better shape and it was no longer a concern for him. Hamilton has won four times previously at Spa, the longest track on the calendar and one of the fastest, while Verstappen is seeking a first at what was a home circuit before the Dutch Grand Prix was reinstated.

Explainer: Who are the Afghan refugees coming to the U.S. and what happens when they arrive?,5110,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Thousands of Afghans have arrived in the United States since the hurried evacuation of Afghanistan began in mid-August, including many who helped U.S. forces during its 20-year involvement in the country's war. WHY IS THE U.S. MILITARY EVACUATING AFGHANS? President Joe Biden said the United States aimed to evacuate 50,000 to 65,000 Afghan allies before an Aug. 31 deadline for U.S. withdrawal. Biden's estimate appeared to refer to Afghans who have applied for a humanitarian visa known as a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV), and their family members. The U.S. government has declined to say how many Afghans have arrived in the United States since the evacuation from Kabul began or the immigration status of those people. WHAT IS THE SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM? SIV's are available to certain Afghans who aided U.S. forces as interpreters and translators, as well as in other roles, and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, the Islamist militant group that swiftly seized power 11 days ago. An estimated 5,000 SIV applicants have already been evacuated from Afghanistan, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Association of Wartime Allies, a group advocating for SIV applicants in Afghanistan and Iraq. The group estimates that 65,000 SIV applicants and family members remain in Afghanistan. WHO ARE THE AFGHANS ARRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES? U.S. military evacuation flights from Kabul have carried U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Afghan SIV applicants and other vulnerable Afghans, according to the Pentagon. Among the Afghans entering the United States are people with approved SIVs and applicants to the program. Other arriving Afghans may seek U.S. asylum or similar forms of relief, advocates say. Afghans who lack valid immigration status when they arrive in the United States can be permitted to enter for a temporary period via ""humanitarian parole."" The Biden administration has not said how many Afghans have been paroled into the United States, but advocates expect many arrivals will lack visas and require parole. WHAT HAPPENS TO AFGHANS WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN THE UNITED STATES? U.S. evacuation flights so far have landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can go on to their destinations after they have been tested for COVID-19. SIV-eligible Afghans and other Afghan arrivals go to U.S. military bases in Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey for processing, according to people familiar with the process. Afghans sent to the military bases receive a health screening and help in applying for work authorization, along with other services. The processing can take anywhere from a day to a week or more, a refugee staffer working at Fort Lee in Virginia told Reuters. After processing at the military bases, Afghans will be connected with a U.S. refugee resettlement organization, a senior U.S. official said. The groups provide SIV-eligible Afghans and others with housing, furniture and food, and help them adjust to life in the United States. ARE THE ARRIVING AFGHANS VETTED FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS? Afghans seeking SIVs must complete a 14-step application process that includes a visa interview and security screening. The Biden administration has said that SIV applicants further along in the application process have been allowed to enter the United States. Applicants in earlier stages are being sent to third countries, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Germany. read more In those countries, the Afghans undergo ""robust security processing,"" the senior administration official said. ""That process involves biometric and biographic security screenings conducted by our intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals who are working quite literally around the clock to vet all of these Afghans before they're allowed into the United States,"" the official said. The Biden administration has not said what type of vetting would be applied to any Afghans entering the United States who are not applying to the SIV program. ARE U.S. REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT GROUPS PREPARED? U.S. refugee resettlement organizations typically receive at least two weeks' notice from the U.S. government or United Nations to prepare for new arrivals, but the hectic evacuation has cut that timeline to days or hours. The hurried pace forced one refugee group in Texas to turn to emergency housing and petition for vacant Airbnb (ABNB.O) rental units while others have scrambled to find mattresses and supplies for families. read more U.S. refugee groups and immigration advocates have for months urged the Biden administration to quickly evacuate vulnerable Afghans and were frustrated by what they perceived as a lack of urgency before the Taliban took control of Kabul. At the same time, the resettlement agencies are rebuilding after former President Donald Trump slashed refugee admissions to the lowest level since the U.S. program began in 1980, forcing the groups to cut staff and close offices.

"Slovenian teachers, students will have to take weekly COVID-19 tests",1283,"SARAJEVO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Students and teachers who have not been inoculated against COVID-19 or recovered from the disease will have to take weekly tests, the Slovenian government said on Thursday as infections in the country rose to their highest since May. The government, which earlier this week stopped providing free rapid tests to encourage more people to get vaccinated, said it would cover the costs of testing students. It also said the same conditions - having recovered from the illness or been vaccinated or tested negative, would apply to anyone over 15 taking part in indoor sports and recreational activities, just as it had earlier ruled for public performers. Some local media reported that education authorities have issued instructions that teachers who do not comply with the required conditions should be fired but Reuters could not confirm the reports. Slovenia on Thursday reported 509 new cases of COVID-19, with a positive test rate of 17.3%. The National Institute of Public Health said that the seven-day average of confirmed cases was 363 and the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population was 199.

Japan suspends 1.6 mln doses of Moderna shot after contamination reports,4325,"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, more than a week after the domestic distributor received reports of contaminants in some vials. Japan and Moderna said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and the suspension was just a precaution. But the move prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations planned for Thursday and led to the European drugs regulator to launch an investigation into the matter. ""Moderna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its COVID-19 vaccine,"" the U.S. vaccine maker said in a statement, adding it put the lot in question and two adjacent lots on hold. ""The company is investigating the reports and remains committed to working expeditiously with its partner, Takeda, and regulators to address this,"" it added, referring to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), which distributes the vaccine in the country. A Health Ministry official said Takeda first found out about the contaminated vials on Aug. 16 and reported the issue to the government on Wednesday. The delay was because Takeda needed time to gather information on which vials were affected and where they were in the country, the official said. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi (ROVI.MC), which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of Rovi's production lines. Rovi, whose shares slumped 13.38%, said in a statement it was investigating and ""working to provide all the information"" about the possible incident. It said the batch in question was meant for distribution only in Japan and two more batches processed before and after it were held back out of caution. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was investigating the contamination incident and was assessing whether there was an impact on EU supplies. ""EMA is investigating the matter and has requested the marketing authorisation holder to provide information on any potential impact on batches supplied to the EU in addition to details on the ongoing root cause investigation,"" the agency said in a statement to Reuters.

Japanese carrier ANA (9202.T) said about 4,700 shots of the halted Moderna lot had been used and it would stop all vaccinations planned on Thursday. Its rival Japan Airlines (9201.T) also cancelled some COVID-19 vaccinations for its employees on Thursday after receiving Moderna vaccines with particulate matter. Despite several companies cancelling planned vaccinations, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the country's inoculation plan would be little affected by the issue. A day earlier, he said about 60% of the public would be fully vaccinated by the end of September and the country had enough vaccines to provide booster doses. read more The decision to suspend use of the Moderna shots comes at an awkward time for Suga, whose government was criticised over a slow rollout in the vaccine campaign earlier in the year.

Greek health workers protest against introduction of mandatory COVID jabs,1700,"ATHENS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Greek frontline health workers protested on Thursday against a plan to make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for the care sector as infection rates remained high. Healthcare workers observed a four-hour work stoppage against new rules obliging medical staff to vaccinate against the coronavirus, and to call for more resources to public health. The mandatory jab comes into effect for healthcare workers on Sept. 1. Those who do not comply and have not had at least one shot of a vaccine will be suspended from their jobs. According to the POEDIN labour union, about 10 percent of healthcare workers have not had a first vaccine jab. Protesters said that while the call for vaccination was widely acknowledged and complied with by healthcare workers, the view of a dissenting few should to be respected. ""I'm here today because I want to support the constitutional right of every Greek citizen to say 'yes' or 'no' to vaccination. I personally am vaccinated, but I believe it is my colleagues' right to not get vaccinated if they don't want to,"" said Evangelia Karatzouli, a nurse at a public hospital.

Soothing Zoom filter will suit Powell speech,3428,"WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A calming prairie landscape would be a good Zoom backdrop for Jerome Powell’s virtual speech on Friday. The annual Federal Reserve confab, once again forced online from its traditional Jackson Hole, Wyoming, location, is usually a place to make news, as the U.S. central bank chair did in 2020. Now amid a Covid-19 resurgence, it's an occasion to avoid surprises. Powell made a big splash at the Kansas City Fed-sponsored conference last year. He announced that the Fed had adopted “average inflation targeting,” meaning it will allow prices to run moderately above its 2% goal for some time. So even if the unemployment rate falls, the central bank may not raise interest rates as long as inflation remains controlled, a policy that Powell acknowledged may be counterintuitive. This year, Powell has to pull off a balancing act. The Fed has been buying $120 billion of bonds each month to support the U.S. economy through the pandemic. This year's burgeoning recovery has pushed inflation higher than expected, in part because of comparisons to a period last year when the economy was shut down and because of supply-chain hiccups that have forced up prices for certain products like used cars. The consumer price index rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier. The minutes of the Fed’s rate-setting committee meeting in July showed that most participants thought asset purchases could be reduced starting this year. Investors want to know when and how so-called tapering will begin, and how it might transition into interest-rate increases. When the Fed wound down the stimulus program that ended in 2014, it shrank its purchases over 10 months and waited more than a year before raising rates. Then-Chair Ben Bernanke rocked markets before that process began in 2013 by saying the Fed would reduce its bond buying earlier than expected. Powell won't want to trigger any similar ""taper tantrum."" Meanwhile the delta variant of the coronavirus has started to damp economic activity again, with recent retail sales and consumer sentiment weakening. As an added challenge for Powell, he is also auditioning for a possible nomination for a second term as Fed chair if President Joe Biden's administration likes what it hears. Reassuring investors on tapering and rates while giving the central bank needed wiggle room will be a test of his skills. Follow @GinaChon on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Aug. 27 at the annual economic policy conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The theme of the event this year is “Macroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy.” On Aug. 20, the Kansas City Fed announced that the planned in-person conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, would instead be held virtually because of Covid-19 health risks.

Africa's COVID-19 third wave stabilises as vaccine levels rise - WHO,1151,"KINSHASA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A third wave of COVID-19 infections in Africa has stabilised and the continent's slow vaccination drive has picked up pace, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday. Some 248,000 new cases were reported in the past week, down from 282,000 in mid-July, while the number of vaccinations tripled to 13 million, Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director, told an online news conference. Africa, with a population of 1.3 billion, has experienced a third wave of infections since May, straining health systems in countries from South Africa to Tunisia, Zambia and Senegal, where vaccination rates are far lower than in Europe and North America. COVAX - the donor scheme co-led by the WHO to purchase vaccines for poorer countries - initially hoped to vaccinate 20% of people in Africa this year, but it has been plagued by delays. The WHO now hopes to vaccinate 10% of people in Africa by the end of September, Moeti said. ""117 million doses are due to arrive in the coming month and up to 34 million additional doses will be needed to reach that target,"" she said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Serbia closes largest unmanaged landfill in Europe -report,1820,"BELGRADE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Serbia closed its huge Vinca landfill, almost three weeks after acrid smoke engulfed the capital Belgrade following a fire at the site, the Tanjug news agency reported on Thursday, citing Irena Vujovic, country's minister for environmental protection. The four-decade old Vinca site is the largest unmanaged landfill site in Europe, according to the International Finance Corporation, and is located around 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) from downtown Belgrade near the Danube river. Its daily intake is more than 1,500 tonnes of household waste and around 3,000 tonnes of construction waste. Due to decomposition and poor waste treatment, fires emitting dense smoke from the site are frequent. read more According to the report, Vujovic said that the now-closed landfill would be stabilised from sliding and recultivated by 2023. ""We had a fire, ... due to 40 years of depositing of waste in a manner not prescribed (by regulations) ... I am hoping it will never happen again,"" the Tanjug quoted Vujovic as saying. According to data from Belgrade's health authorities, the Vinca landfill has so far released over 4 billion cubic meters of methane into the atmosphere. In recent years, Serbia's environmental organisations have staged protests to demand closure of the landfill. Belgrade authorities and the French-Japanese consortium Suez-Itochu in 2019 began construction of a new landfill site, incinerator and a waste-to-energy plant. Serbia is a candidate for membership of European Union, but before it can join, it needs to invest more than 15 billion euros to comply with the bloc's environmental standards, including those concerning solid and liquid waste treatment.

mRNA vaccines trigger backup immune response; some cancer drugs may help,3292,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Here is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Antibodies wane but other immune defenses remain alert A new study may help explain why mRNA vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are more effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths than they are at preventing infection. Test-tube experiments on blood samples from 61 fully vaccinated adults showed that by six months, vaccine-induced antibodies that can immediately neutralize the virus had declined. But so-called memory B cells, which produce new antibodies if they encounter the virus later on, had increased and become better at recognizing viral variants, according to a report posted on Monday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. ""Your immune system has a backup,"" said study leader John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. B-cell production of antibodies might take a few days to get underway, but then these memory B cells ""kick into action and prevent severe disease,"" Wherry added. Early data favors certain cancer treatments during pandemic Certain cancer drugs may help protect patients with malignancies from being infected with the new coronavirus, preliminary data suggests. The drugs, known as mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and antimetabolites, target the parts of cells that the virus uses to enter and make copies of itself, including a ""gateway"" protein on cell surfaces called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The study of 1,701 cancer patients found that after taking underlying risk factors into account, patients treated with mTOR/PI3K inhibitors or ACE2-lowering antimetabolites were 47% less likely to test positive for the virus than patients who received other drug therapies. Gemzar (gemcitabine) from Eli Lilly appeared to be particularly promising, according to the report in JAMA Oncology on Thursday. The study does not prove that the drugs lowered infection rates, however, and much more research is needed to confirm their potential for protecting cancer patients from the coronavirus. One in four infected LA residents had been vaccinated From May through July 2021, as the Delta variant spread, 43,127 residents of Los Angeles County in California were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections. One in four had been fully vaccinated, though these patients had lower rates of hospitalization (3.2% versus 7.6%), intensive care (0.5% versus 1.5%) and need for machines to help with breathing (0.2% versus 0.5%) than unvaccinated patients, public health officials reported on Tuesday in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. During the study period, the prevalence of the Delta variant rose from less than 9% to at least 87%, the authors note. As of July 25, hospitalization rates were 29 times higher for unvaccinated patients, they estimated, ""indicating that COVID-19 vaccination protects against severe COVID-19 in areas with increasing prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.""

EU says COVID boosters may have higher legal risks without EMA approval,3244,"BRUSSELS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - European Union countries that decide to use COVID-19 vaccine booster shots may face increased legal risks because the additional dose has not yet been recommended by the EU drugs regulator, the European Commission said on Thursday. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has repeatedly said that more data is needed before it can approve the use of boosters, but eight European countries have decided to recommend the additional dose, and more than a dozen are set to make similar moves shortly. ""Booster doses are currently not part of the marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines and have not yet been subject to a scientific assessment by EMA in the absence of sufficient data,"" the EU Commission said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday. ""The responsibility to decide to include boosters in their vaccination campaign remains with the Member States,"" the statement said, adding: ""As long as the booster doses are not part of the marketing authorisation, companies' liability is modified."" This could mean that in the event of unexpected side effects that can be linked to boosters, EU states might bear the brunt of any legal consequences and compensation demands. The Commission said however that companies' liability would not disappear entirely if boosters are administered without the EMA's approval. For instance, if a side effect after a booster is caused by manufacturing issues, the vaccine maker would remain liable for it. EU liability and indemnity rules apply in cases of unexpected adverse effects linked to the general characteristics of the product or its manufacturing. Each company supplying COVID-19 vaccines to the EU has negotiated different clauses, which remain largely confidential. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovenia are currently recommending the use of boosters, with Germany planning to do the same in the autumn. Thirteen other European states are discussing the matter. In recent months, the EU has reserved billions of doses from several COVID-19 vaccine makers for the coming years, saying they may be needed for boosters or to fight new variants. They could also be donated to poorer nations. COVID-19 booster shots will be made widely available to Americans from Sept. 20, U.S. health officials said last week, citing data showing diminishing protection from the initial vaccinations as infections rise from the Delta variant read more . Possible compensation for unexpected side effects from COVID-19 vaccines is managed at national level. Some EU countries, including the largest ones, have compensation schemes that are meant to indemnify potential victims outside courts, but criteria for reimbursements vary greatly. In others, alleged victims would need to go directly to courts to settle their case. Since the beginning of the vaccination campaign in Europe, hundreds of claims have been submitted to authorities by potential victims, official data from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Switzerland show, with only a handful of compensation awards so far granted, for undisclosed amounts of money.

Qatar offering COVID vaccines to Afghanistan evacuees yet to transit,1633,"DUBAI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Qatar is offering COVID-19 vaccines to evacuees from Afghanistan who are temporarily staying in the Gulf Arab state, which has been facilitating global evacuation efforts since the Taliban seized Kabul, the foreign ministry said on Thursday. Qatar, which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region, has so far helped evacuate more than 40,000 people to Doha and will continue to facilitate international efforts in ""the coming days"", the ministry said in a statement. Those who do not immediately transit to other countries are being provided with a PCR test and COVID-19 vaccine, if requested, it said, adding that Doha is temporarily hosting ""a large number of evacuees most of them students, families and journalists"".

"Two Asian W.Cup qualifiers moved to Doha over COVID-19, security issues",1524,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - The World Cup qualifier between Iraq and Iran as well as Australia-China will be held at a neutral venue in Doha due to security and COVID-19 related reasons, the Asian Football Confederation said on Thursday. Both matches will be held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar's capital, with Australia facing China on Sept. 2 and Iraq playing Iran five days later. The AFC said in a statement that the ""the ongoing security situation"" in Iraq and Syria forced the Asian soccer governing body to move the Iraq-Iran match, while the Australia-China game, originally planned for Sydney, was affected by COVID-19. ""... The upcoming home matches involving the four nations will be held at neutral venues as part of the AFC's efforts to ensure the highest safety standards and optimum playing conditions for all stakeholders,"" the AFC said in a statement.

VP Harris says U.S. will 'speak up' on South China Sea,4345,"HANOI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The United States welcomes competition and does not seek conflict with Beijing, but will speak up on issues like maritime disputes in the South China Sea, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday as she concluded a trip to Southeast Asia. In visits to Singapore and Vietnam, Harris charged China with bullying its neighbors in the region, triggering sharp rebukes from Beijing, which accused the U.S. of meddling in regional affairs and disrupting peace. read more ""We welcome stiff competition, we do not seek conflict, but on issues such as the South China Sea, we are going to speak up,"" Harris told a news conference in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. ""We are going to speak up when there are actions that Beijing takes that threaten the rules-based international order,"" she added. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to take on China globally. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contains gas fields and rich fishing grounds. In meetings with Vietnamese leaders on Wednesday, Harris said China's ""bullying and excessive maritime claims"" in the waters should be challenged, and offered U.S. support to enhance Vietnam's maritime security, including more visits by U.S. warships to the country. read more Her statements drew condemnation from Chinese state media. On Wednesday, the state run China Daily, responding to Harris' comments in Singapore, said Harris had ""willfully ignored her own hypocrisy"" in attempting to rally countries in the region against China. On Thursday, after her meetings in Hanoi, the Global Times said the U.S. was ""dreaming"" to incite Vietnam to confront China. ""For Washington, it couldn't be better if a new war between Beijing and Hanoi breaks out,"" the tabloid, published by the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris holds a news conference before departing Vietnam for the United States following her first official visit to Asia, in Hanoi, Vietnam, August 26, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/Pool 'HAVANA SYNDROME' In addition to rebukes by China's foreign ministry and state media, Beijing attempted to stage its own diplomatic coup during the trip with a surprise meeting in Vietnam, held as Harris' departure from Singapore was delayed by three hours. During the previously unannounced meeting, between Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and the Chinese ambassador, Chinh said Vietnam does not take sides in foreign policy, and thanked the ambassador for a new donation of 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. read more In her own meeting with Chinh one day later, Harris pledged a U.S. donation of 1 million Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine doses to Vietnam. Harris' delayed arrival was later attributed by the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi to a mystery health incident potentially related to the mysterious ""Havana Syndrome,"" a condition of unknown origin that has sickened at least 200 U.S. officials, including CIA officers, with symptoms including nausea, migraines and memory lapses. ""I will tell you we're looking into it and I'm not able to share much more at this time,"" Harris said of the incident in Thursday's news conference. GEOPOLITICAL TEST The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century as it tries to rebuild its relationships in the region with a series of high-profile visits. Over the last few years, tensions between China and Vietnam in the South China Sea have remained high, although Hanoi has attempted to strike a delicate balancing act. Hanoi and Beijing's ruling Communist parties maintain close ties, and Vietnam is dependent on imported Chinese materials to support its manufacturing and exports. Meanwhile, ties with old foe the United States have grown increasingly close, although Washington has said there are limits to the relationship until Vietnam makes progress on human rights, an issue Harris said she raised with the country'sleaders. ""We will not shy away from speaking out, even when those conversations, may be difficult to have, and perhaps difficult to hear,"" she told reporters.

Pentagon makes Pfizer vaccine mandatory after FDA approval- memo,1506,"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered all active-duty service members to be vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine days after the Food and Drug Administration granted it full approval. In a memo seen by Reuters, the Pentagon ordered the military to start the process immediately but did not put a specific timeline on when it should be completed. Earlier in the week it had said that such a move would be coming. The U.S. military has said that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members. Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19. The Pfizer shot became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be fully approved by the FDA. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thailand in talks to buy COVID-19 vaccines from European nations,1730,"BANGKOK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Thailand is in talks with European countries to purchase millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, a health official said on Thursday, as the Southeast Asian nation tries to speed up its inoculation rollout to contain a wave of infections. Authorities in Thailand have been scrambling to shore up vaccine supplies, despite the country being the production hub for AstraZeneca shots in the region. Last week, the government said it would borrow 150,000 AstraZeneca doses from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. read more ""Some countries may have a surplus of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) or Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccines and will be able to sell two to three million doses each month,"" senior health official Kiattiphum Wongrajit told a briefing. Kiattiphum did not specify any European countries involved in the talks. So far, about 9% of Thailand's population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated as it deals with its deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus. The majority of the country’s 1.1 million infections and 10,314 fatalities came after April this year due to the highly-transmissible Alpha and Delta variants, though infection rates have shown signs of easing. ""New cases have peaked and new infections will gradually decrease,"" Kiattiphum said. On Monday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said AstraZeneca would deliver 61 million doses that were previously delayed by the end of this year. read more Thailand's coronavirus taskforce will decide on Friday whether to relax lockdown measures, including a proposal to shorten a nighttime curfew and allow dining in at restaurants for those who are vaccinated or have been recently tested, he said.

Kerala's COVID-19 lessons for India and Modi's government,6396,"MALAPPURAM, India, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Vilified by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party for its high COVID-19 cases, Kerala's apparent poor record may actually hold crucial lessons for the country in containing the outbreak as authorities brace for a possible third wave of infections. The opposition-ruled, densely populated southern state is currently reporting the most number of coronavirus cases in the country and accounts for the second-highest national tally - unflattering headline numbers that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has seized upon as a reflection of bungled local leadership. However, a Reuters analysis of national and state data, and interviews with epidemiologists and Kerala health authorities paint a different picture. It shows the state's containment measures have helped to catch infections early, allowing authorities to better manage the illness and dramatically lower the death rate - a stark contrast to people dying in carparks and outside hospitals for lack of oxygen and beds in big cities like Delhi at the height of the health crisis a few months earlier. ""While the federal government may have its views on rapid antigen tests, it is important to consider that the state's strategies have by and large succeeded in not just keeping mortality low but also in being able to detect one in six cases compared to one in 33 nationally,"" said Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. The efficient detection rate and its population density at more than twice the national average explain the high number of cases in Kerala. All the same, at 0.5%, Kerala still has the lowest fatality rate among all but one thinly populated state. The national figure is 1.4% and it is 1.3% for the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The difference comes down to Kerala's reliance on rapid antigen tests to detect and strictly isolate infected people at home, an approach the federal health ministry has sharply criticised but which state officials argue has helped them to better allocate hospital beds and oxygen supplies for those who really need them. The government-recommended RT-PCR tests are more accurate but take longer to produce results, meaning by the time a positive COVID-19 case is confirmed the infected person is more likely to have developed severe symptoms and passed it on to others in a vicious cycle of more infections and deaths. Kerala's rapid test results allow for early treatment in home isolation which then narrows the virus' path to infections, state officials say. These factors, along with the strained medical resources across much of India, largely explain why the overall national death rate is much higher than in the Communist-run state. Kerala officials also say a state-run support service that includes phone consultation, provision of drugs and pulse oximeters that detect blood oxygen levels for people recovering at home provide a bulwark in the battle against the disease. Delhi had a similar support structure but it collapsed when cases surged. ""We do have a different model and our fatality rate shows our model is on the right track,"" Kerala Health Minister Veena George told Reuters. But Kerala officials acknowledge that the fast-evolving pandemic can undo even the best thought-out plans unless authorities remain nimble and flexible. A MODEL TO EMULATE? When Reuters recently visited Kerala's most populous Malappuram district, which is reporting the greatest number of infections in India, a quarter of the 344 COVID beds in its biggest hospital were vacant and oxygen supply was ample. The Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended lockdowns for districts where more than 10% of the tests return positive results. The rate is about 15% for Kerala and even higher in Malappuram, but shops and restaurants are open for business. Kerala officials argue that they are able to keep businesses open as the state has the best testing rate among Indian states - 86 tests per 100 people, compared with about 33 in Uttar Pradesh - meaning they are able to catch infections early and ensure timely treatment. The model, epidemiologists say, can be replicated in few other states with good health facilities, such as neighbouring Tamil Nadu. ""Their surveillance is good, they detect cases early and their testing is very focused,"" M.D. Gupte, a retired director of the National Institute of Epidemiology who advises the federal government on immunisations, said about Kerala. ""Most people in Kerala are educated, so that helps."" India’s daily demand for medical oxygen jumped more than eight times in May from pre-pandemic levels, but Kerala avoided major shortages of hospital beds and oxygen that crippled many states when nationwide infections saw an explosive surge. The federal health ministry did not respond to emails requesting comment. VACCINE PUSH Minister George said the state was on course to administer at least one vaccine dose to all adults by next month, the fastest pace among all states. Currently, the state has covered more than 55% of adults with at least one vaccine dose, compared with 48% for the whole of India, which wants to vaccinate all its adults by December. Kerala, with 35.5 million people, has so far reported 3.8 million infections, or 12% of India's total of 32.5 million. Its 19,757 deaths, however, account for only 4% of the overall nationwide fatalities. The Indian government recommends 70% of all COVID-19 tests be carried out by the RT-PCR method, while Kerala's rate is less than 50%. ""This is not the Kerala model, this is a model of mismanagement,"" BJP President Jagat Prakash Nadda, India's former health minister, said last week. He said BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had better managed the pandemic, though a government survey estimated in July that more than 70% residents of both states had been exposed to the virus. The figure was 44% for Kerala. Kerala's COVID-19 hospitalisation rate is only about 3%, a state official said, compared with more than 5% nationwide when cases peaked in May. T.S. Anish, a member of Kerala's COVID Expert Committee, said the state was now focused on vaccination.

"New York governor reveals 12,000 more COVID-19 deaths than previously counted",2860,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - New York Governor Kathy Hochul revealed 12,000 more people died of COVID-19 than was reported under her disgraced predecessor, making good on her promise for greater transparency on just her second day leading the state. The state is now reporting a total of 55,400 people died in New York from coronavirus, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hochul said in a statement. That's an increase of 12,000 over the 43,400 reported by Andrew Cuomo as of his last day in office before resigning in disgrace amid a sexual harassment scandal. ""We're using CDC numbers, which will be consistent. And so there's no opportunity for us to mask those numbers,"" Hochul told National Public Radio on Wednesday. Even with the additional 12,000 deaths, it does not change how New York state ranks nationally. New York still has the third highest total number of COVID deaths in the country, behind California and Texas. And New York still ranks second for deaths per capita, behind New Jersey, according to a Reuters tally. Hochul is a Democrat who assumed the top job on Tuesday after serving as Cuomo's lieutenant governor.

The revised count is based on death certificate data submitted to the CDC, which includes any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 deaths in any location in New York, Hochul said in the statement. ""These are presumed and confirmed deaths. People should know both,"" Hochul told NPR. The revelation came on Hochul's second day on the job as governor, the first woman to hold New York's top office. After being sworn in on Tuesday, Hochul made a point of promising the public greater transparency to ensure that New Yorkers ""believe in their government again."" read more Immediately shining a spotlight on the numbers the Cuomo administration chose to report, Hochul became only the latest official to raise questions about whether he was massaging data to improve his image during the pandemic that once gripped New York as the U.S. epicenter.

Dust at BHP's iron ore mines poses health hazard-union,2078,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - High levels of dust at two of BHP Group's (BHP.AX) iron ore mines in Western Australia are impairing the health of workers and nearby residents, a union said this week, as BHP said it had undertaken a raft of measures to limit dust in the arid region. The state's environmental regulator this month began a review into elevated levels of airborne dust at BHP's Whaleback and Newman mines in the Pilbara, as part of a review into BHP's licence conditions and public submissions closed this week. The review will be undertaken over the second half of this year and could result in changes to BHP's license conditions. The mines are some 1,065 kilometres (662 miles) north east of Perth. A survey of current or former residents and mine workers who spent a significant amount of time in the community found 80% said the dust had affected their lives, according to a submission by the Western Mine Workers Alliance. Of those, 82% said they had experienced adverse health affects, while others said they had suffered property damage and impacts to their lifestyle due to dust. “All industry has some impact on the local environment,” said Brad Gandy, state branch secretary of the Australian Workers Union, which is part of the alliance. “The problem is how this impact is managed, and it is clear that dust emissions are at levels that seriously affect the health, wellbeing and lifestyles of the Newman community.” BHP said in a statement that it prioritises the health and safety of its employees and host communities, and was committed to managing our dust levels in Newman. ""Air quality is complex and the majority of elevated dust events in Newman occur in conjunction with certain weather conditions,"" it said. Dust control measures across the sites include using dust suppress sprays, water trucks and revegetation programs. It is spending $230 million over the next five years to further improve air quality and implement dust mitigation work to keep dust levels as low as possible, it said.

Japan's Suga faces challengers in ruling party leadership race,4020,"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Japanese former foreign minister Fumio Kishida challenged Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Thursday for the leadership of the ruling party, as the premier struggles with crumbling approval rates ahead of a general election. Suga repeated he would seek re-election in the Sept. 29 race for Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president, while ex-internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi also threw her hat in the ring. The winner is virtually assured of being prime minister because of the LDP's majority in parliament's lower house. The LDP chief must lead the party to a general election by Nov. 28, which the Sankei newspaper said will be held in October or later. L1N2PX0E0 ""The people feel that their voices are not reaching the LDP,"" Kishida, 64, told a news conference. ""I am running ... to show that the LDP listens to the people and is a party that offers broad choices, and to protect our nation's democracy,"" said Kishida, adding he would aim for a more equitable, diverse society. The challenges to Suga may not topple him as leader, said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. ""My sense is, most people in markets expect Suga to win unless he decides to quit by himself."" The LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its majority in the powerful lower house, but forecasts suggest that Suga's party could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever is leading the LDP. Suga, 72, took office last September with support of about 70% but his ratings have sunk below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections and many of his LDP lawmakers fear for their seats. LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, who was key to Suga's victory last year, said on Wednesday he still backs the prime minister. The party's smallest faction, led by former cabinet minister Nobuteru Ishihara, was also lining up behind Suga, Jiji news agency reported. Other party bosses, including former premier Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso, have not commented publicly. KISHIDA LOW-KEY, LOW-POPULARITY Unlike last year, grass-roots LDP members will vote along with the party's members of parliament, which could make the outcome harder to predict. And novice MPs, fearful of losing their seats, may be wary of following their elders' orders. Kishida, a soft-spoken lawmaker from Hiroshima, had been seen as the preferred heir to Abe, who stepped down last year as prime minister citing ill health. But Kishida lost the ensuing party poll after factions coalesced around Suga, who had been Abe's right-hand man for eight years. Kishida said he'd aim to reduce income gaps and support the economically vulnerable such as workers in insecure jobs and women, an apparent effort to differentiate his stance from Suga, who has stressed self-reliance before public support. He called for an economic stimulus package as soon as possible, but did not specify its size. The low-key Kishida has ranked low in surveys of voters' preferred next prime minister, well below other possible rivals such as Administrative Reform Minister Taro Kono, who is leading Japan's vaccination rollout, and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba. ""Unless they chose someone like Ishiba who is more popular with the public, it will be hard to recover lost support,"" said Hiroyoshi Sunakawa, a professor at Tokyo's Rikkyo University. Takaichi, a conservative Abe disciple seen as a long-shot to become Japan's first female premier, told reporters she wanted to finish what Abe had left undone, including hitting a 2% inflation target that has eluded policy makers. Suga had hoped to call the general election in September after hosting the Olympics, but a spike in COVID-19 cases upended that scenario. Suga's pandemic response suffered another setback after Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) said it has withheld 1.63 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan after a report of contamination. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
AstraZeneca drug for rare disease shows promise in flushing copper build-up,1401,"Aug 26 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) said on Thursday a late-stage trial showed its medicine for a rare disease that causes accumulation of copper in the body was three times more successful in helping remove deposits from tissues compared with standard care. The treatment, developed by the drugmaker's recently acquired Alexion rare diseases unit, was being tested for Wilson disease, a genetic condition in which the body's ability to remove excess copper is compromised. The experimental oral medicine taken once-daily could provide a less invasive option for patients who are typically given treatments which involve injecting a metal removing solution into the blood or zinc therapy. ""As we advance this first innovation in Wilson disease treatment in more than 30 years, we will continue to follow these patients long term to further assess clinical impact on disease symptoms,"" Alexion Chief Executive Officer Marc Dunoyer said. Copper build-up can cause liver disease and psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such as personality changes, tremors and difficulty in walking, swallowing or talking. The study met the main goal of improvement in the daily mean copper mobilised from tissues over a period of 48 weeks. The treatment has been given an ""Orphan Drug"" status in the United States and European Union to help speed up development. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
African football urges UK to give footballers travel exemption,2507,"CAIRO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The Confederation of African Football has appealed to the British government to grant exemptions to African footballers who are hoping to return to their home countries next week to compete in World Cup qualifiers. The call follows the collective decision by the clubs of Premier League to refuse to release players headed to countries on the United Kingdom’s COVID-19 ‘red list’ because of the quarantine measures they would face on their return from international duty. “CAF, on behalf of all African member associations, African players and fans, has urged the British Government to urgently provide the required exemptions to enable African players to compete for their countries in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers,” said a statement. “CAF notes that similar exemptions were granted by the British Government to enable the attendance of delegations and officials, among others, at the finals of the European Championship held less than two months ago. “It is further noted that the circumstances in the African countries on the red list in many cases are in fact less severe than other countries not currently on this list or for which exemptions were previously provided.” There are 25 African countries on the ‘red list’, which is expected to be updated on Thursday. CAF said all next month’s World Cup qualifiers in Africa, which will be played from Wednesday Sept. 1 through to Tuesday Sept. 7, would be under strict health conditions. “The upcoming matches will be delivered under the strict protocols developed by FIFA and applied across the world, as was the case in previous windows and continental tournaments successfully delivered without any incidents. “These protocols have now proven beyond a doubt that they mitigate the risks involved, reflecting the success of commensurate protocols applied domestically in England and other parts of the world. “In light of the above, CAF has appealed as a matter of urgency, to the Football Association (FA) and the British Government that the same treatment previously applied to Europe now be extended to Africa under the principles of solidarity and equal treatment,” the statement added. It followed a similar appeal for solidarity on Wednesday from FIFA president Gianni Infantino, whose organisation had previously allowed clubs to refuse call-ups to players who face quarantine on return for international assignments but cancelled that temporary ruling in June.

"Players in 'bubble' before Australian Open, not quarantine",2584,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australian Open organisers are planning for players to have two weeks in a biosecure bubble before next year's Grand Slam rather than be subject to the country's strict hotel quarantine regime, tournament boss Craig Tiley said on Thursday. Players, coaches and officials had to spend 14 days in hotel quarantine after arriving in Australia for the tournament in February due to COVID-19 restrictions, though most were permitted up to five hours a day to train at closed courts. ""There's a lot of time between now and when we get going, but at this point in time we're planning on having a two-week bubble, where the players will be able to move freely between the hotel and the courts,"" Tiley said at a Nine Network event. ""They’re protected, they’re kept safe among themselves and safe from the community as well. ""And after those two weeks, they’ll come out and be able to compete in the Australian Open in front of crowds. ""We’re working with the government and health authorities now on the amount of crowds and what the Australian Open will specifically look like."" The year's first Grand Slam is held at Melbourne Park. About 70 Australian Open players were unable to leave their hotel rooms for their entire isolation last January after being deemed close contacts of positive cases on flights into Australia. Some complained bitterly about the conditions, triggering a backlash from Melbourne residents who were subject to one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly four months in 2020. Only one player, Spain's Paula Badosa, tested positive for the coronavirus. Tiley said last month players would not be prepared to go through the same quarantine conditions again. read more Last year's tournament was pushed back to February because organisers were unable to secure government approval in time. Organisers are targeting the traditional January slot for the next one, although another lockdown in Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, and Australia's slow vaccine roll-out have clouded the outlook. read more Australia has a vague plan to start opening up the country when 70% of adults are fully vaccinated but less than a third have had two doses. State leaders have also said they may still close borders and order lockdowns to try to contain outbreaks, undermining the federal government's plan. Tiley said he hoped Australia would reach its target of vaccinating 80% of adults by November. ""That will certainly help the situation for the event in January,"" he added.

Death toll rises to at least 20 in western Venezuela floods,2667,"SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, Aug 25 (Reuters) - At least 20 people have died in the western Venezuelan state of Merida following intense rains that caused mudslides and rivers to overflow. On state TV on Wednesday a ruling Socialist Party official in Merida announced the death doll had risen and said authorities were working to restore telephone service in some areas. State governor Ramon Guevara said earlier that more than 1,200 houses had been destroyed and 17 people remained missing as rescue workers search the wreckage. ""Let's try not to make this political or ideological,"" Guevara, a member of the Democratic Action opposition party, said. ""Lets all look for solutions to the problem."" Images shared on social media showed cars being swept down streets, buildings and businesses filled with mud, and mudslides that left boulders strewn across roads. Several towns in the affected area including Tovar, Bailadores, Zea and Santa Cruz de Mora are without electricity as floodwaters damaged transformers, Guevara said. Neither the state nor municipal governments have the resources to help the affected areas, he said, but he had charged infrastructure specialists to work with Caracas on repairing buildings and roads. President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday said Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami had guaranteed fuel for the rescue efforts.

Guevara instructed officials to organize a humanitarian aid collection post in Merida's city center where they are receiving contributions of water, non-perishable food, clothing and blankets. Guevara also deployed health workers to the hardest hit places.

China criticises U.S. 'scapegoating' over COVID origin report,3662,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday criticized the U.S. ""politicization"" of efforts to trace the origin of the coronavirus, demanding without any evidence that American labs be investigated, ahead of the release of a U.S. intelligence report on the virus. The U.S. report is intended to resolve disputes among intelligence agencies considering different theories about how the coronavirus emerged, including a once-dismissed theory about a Chinese laboratory accident. ""Scapegoating China cannot whitewash the U.S.,"" Fu Cong, director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' arms control department, told a briefing. U.S. President Joe Biden received a copy and was briefed on the classified report on Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. The intelligence community has been ""working expeditiously"" to prepare an unclassified version for the public, Psaki said without giving a timeline for its release. U.S. officials say they do not expect the review to lead to firm conclusions after China stymied earlier international efforts to gather key information on the ground. read more China has said a laboratory leak was highly unlikely, and it has ridiculed a theory that coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 infections emerged in late 2019, setting off the pandemic. Beijing has instead suggested that the virus slipped out of a lab at the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick base in Maryland in 2019. ""It is only fair that if the U.S. insists that this is a valid hypothesis, they should do their turn and invite the investigation into their labs,"" Fu said. Fu Cong, the director-general of the arms control department of Chinese foreign ministry, speaks at a news conference on COVID-19 origin-tracking related issues, in Beijing, China August 25, 2021. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Fu said China was not engaged in a disinformation campaign. The fringe idea once put forward by individual Chinese officials - which lacks any public evidence - has become a Chinese government talking point as it attempts to deflect criticism about its possible role in the origins of the virus. On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Washington posted the calls for World Health Organization investigations at Fort Detrick and at the University of North Carolina to its website after it said U.S. media had rejected its editorial submissions. And on Tuesday, China's envoy to the United Nations asked the head of the WHO for an investigation into U.S. labs. A joint WHO-Chinese team visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology but the United States said it had concerns about the access granted to the investigation. ""The early days of the pandemic were irrefutably in China, yet China continues to obfuscate and deny the international community the needed access,"" a senior U.S. administration official said, adding that if a future pandemic were to originate in the United States, it would insist on a ""swift and transparent"" evaluation. ""If there were sound, technically credible reasons for a U.S. investigation, we would of course support it. But there are none,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who has argued a Chinese lab leak was plausible, in a statement urged the Biden administration to immediately declassify the report. ""The American people deserve to know what our government does and does not know about the origins of COVID-19,"" Rubio said. A key Congressional panel has been advised it may receive a copy of the classified report on Thursday, according to a Congressional official. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Japan's ruling LDP to hold party leader elections on Sept 29,727,"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will hold an election to pick its president on Sept. 29, party officials said on Thursday, with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga all but certain to face a challenge for the post. Suga took office last September after Shinzo Abe quit citing ill health, and his term expires at the end of next month. The premier's ratings have fallen below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections, and some in the party want to replace him before a general election expected in October or later. LDP members of parliament and grassroots party members will vote in the leadership poll, the officials said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Meanwhile, people aged over 65 and those will existing medical conditions will be able to book appointments for a booster shot from early September, Castex told RTL radio, adding there must be a six-month delay between the second and the third shot.

"Vietnam expects 50,000 new virus cases in major manufacturing hub",2110,"HANOI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam will deploy troops to industrial Binh Duong province, a major manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian country, to help contain an expected 50,000 additional coronavirus infections there over the next two weeks, the government said on Thursday. Binh Duong is adjacent to virus epicentre Ho Chi Minh City and has so far recorded 81,000 COVID-19 cases, a third of which were detected in the past week, according to Vietnam's health ministry. The province is home to production facilities for dozens of major firms, including South Korea's Kumho Tire (073240.KS) and Tetra Pak, the world's largest food packaging company. The province also hosts a string of suppliers for Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Pegatron (4938.TW), a key supplier for Apple. It is one of Vietnam's largest recipients of foreign investment after Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Provincial authorities are preparing for a worst-case scenario within which cases could exceed 150,000, the government said in a statement on its website. The number refers to a contingency plan, and is not a projection. 2,000 troops will be sent to the province to support the fight against the virus, the government statement said, along with 50 mobile medical stations and 15 ambulances. Vietnam has deployed soldiers to the streets of Ho Chi Minh City to help enforce the country's strictest movement curbs yet which prevent people from leaving home, even for food. Ordinary residents who need to travel in the event of a medical emergency can still do so, but the military has taken over the distribution of food in most parts of the city. After successfully containing the pandemic for much of last year, Vietnam has been battling a surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. The country has recorded a total of 381,000 cases, most of which were detected in Ho Chi Minh City and its surrounding provinces since late April. Vietnam has one of Asia's lowest inoculation rates, with just over 2% of its 98 people fully-vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Australian environmental group sues Santos over clean energy claims,2256,"MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - An Australian environmental group is suing the country's No.2 independent gas producer Santos Ltd (STO.AX), alleging the company's statements about gas being ""clean"" and having a clear pathway to net zero by 2040 were deceptive. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court on Thursday, and says it is the first case in the world to challenge the validity of a company's net zero emissions target. Companies around the world have set out ambitious targets to be carbon neutral within the next 20 to 30 years, under pressure from investors concerned about climate change. Santos has said it aims to get to net zero by 2040 with the help of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects - including plans to store carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gas fields - and with soil carbon projects such as tree planting. Santos declined to comment on the matter before the court, but its spokesperson said the company stands by its statements. CCS, which is mainly used today for enhanced oil recovery projects, is seen by green groups as untested and unnecessarily prolonging the life of the fossil fuel industry. ACCR said its case is a world-first test case around the viability of CCS and the environmental impacts of blue hydrogen, or hydrogen produced using gas, with the carbon dioxide emitted in the process captured and stored. ""Santos has perfected the art of greenwashing, and shareholders continue to be misled by Santos' clean energy claims,"" ACCR's director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said in a statement. ACCR is asking the court to declare that Santos has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, prohibit the company from doing so in the future, and require the company to correct statements about the environmental impact of its operations.

Afghanistan's banks brace for bedlam after Taliban takeover,5437,"LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's banks, critical to the country's recovery from crisis, are facing an uncertain future say its bankers, with doubts over everything from liquidity to employment of female staff after the Taliban swept to power. Banks were expected to reopen imminently, a Taliban spokesman said on Tuesday, after they were closed for some ten days and the financial system ground to a halt as the Western-backed government collapsed amid the pullout of U.S. and allied troops. Yet there has been scant evidence so far of a reopening or of banking services returning to normal, with large crowds thronging the streets outside banks in Kabul on Wednesday. ""The banks continue to be closed - with no clear signs of reopening, they have run out of money,"" said Gazal Gailani, trade and economic adviser at the Afghan embassy in London. ""Afghanistan's banking system is now in a state of collapse, and people are running out of money."" Many rural areas get by largely without banks. But in the cities, where government worker salaries are often paid into bank accounts, closures are causing hardship in a mostly cash-based economy. The outlook for lenders looks precarious, with looming questions about the Taliban's grasp of finance and its ability to restart an economy shattered by 40 years of war. With no significant exports apart from illegal narcotics bringing in cash, one immediate obstacle is liquidity in a country that is heavily dollarised and relies on regular physical dollar-shipments that have been halted, according to former central bank chief Ajmal Ahmady. The Afghanistan Banks Association (ABA) had reached out to the central bank to coordinate steps on a return to normality, said Syed Moosa Kaleem Al-Falahi, chief executive and president of Islamic Bank of Afghanistan (IBA), one of Afghanistan's three largest banks. Commercial banks had collectively decided to suspend services until the central bank confirmed liquidity and security arrangements, he said. ""It would be rather difficult to control the rush if banks reopen immediately,"" he added. Liquidity had already been an issue in the run-up to the bank closures as people scrambled to withdraw cash. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, provided financial support to banks during last week's cash squeeze, said a banker at one of Afghanistan's largest lenders, speaking on condition of anonymity. But its ability to continue to do so appears uncertain, with DAB's roughly $9 billion in foreign reserves looking largely out of Taliban reach. read more ""Banks will face major liquidity challenges as central bank officials have not had access to reserves yet,"" the banker said. ""They will face foreign currency liquidity issues which will cause huge fluctuations in the exchange rates."" SCARCE DOLLARS The afghani plunged on the expectation of dollar scarcity and further volatility is expected, with Afghanistan's import coverage reportedly collapsing from more than 15 months to a couple of days. Bankers in Afghanistan are also waiting for clarity from foreign-based correspondent banks, which provide services such as currency exchange and money transfers, on whether ties will continue after the Taliban takeover. Any new sanctions could see many links cut. A senior Afghan banker said their bank's correspondent banks in Turkey, Russia, Spain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Pakistan and India were still showing support. Faith in the banking system was severely damaged by the 2010 collapse of Kabul Bank, in one of the biggest corruption scandals of the 20-year Western presence in Afghanistan. Banks emerged in generally good health from the COVID-19 pandemic, said DAB in its 2020 report, noticing no liquidity shortfall, while capital positions met regulatory thresholds and assets swelled 4% to 327 billion afghanis ($3.8 billion). But the current crisis will further set back confidence in a sector which has struggled to expand services in a thinly banked country. According to the International Monetary Fund, only 183 of every 1,000 people hold a deposit account; there are less than two bank branches or cash machines for every 100,000 adults. FEMALE STAFF WORRIES This week, the Taliban said it had named Haji Mohammad Idris, a loyalist with no formal financial training, as DAB's acting governor. A senior Taliban leader defended the appointment, saying Idris was respected for his expertise. read more It is so far unclear whether Afghanistan's less than a dozen banks, all but one of which are conventional, will have to convert to Islamic banking, a lengthy and costly procedure. More uncertainty surrounds the future employment of female staff. ""So far there is no official communication from them (the Taliban) with respect to female staff,"" said IBA's Al-Falahi. ""Our female staff will return to work when we reopen."" But given the Taliban's track record, their assurances that women would be allowed to work consistent with Islamic law have been met with scepticism. The banker at one of Afghanistan's largest lenders said their bank had a plan to ensure it could continue operations in the event of it having to dismiss its roughly 20% of female staff. ""We expect we will face challenges such as losing qualified and high-skilled staff as most of them are planning to flee the country at the first opportunity,"" the banker said.

India's GDP growth likely touched a record in April-June - Reuters poll,2373,"BENGALURU, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Indian economic growth likely touched a record high in the quarter through June, reflecting a very weak base last year and a rebound in consumer spending, a Reuters poll found. The Aug. 20-25 Reuters poll of 41 economists showed gross domestic product rose 20.0% in the three-month period, compared with a record contraction of 24.4% in the same quarter a year earlier. Forecasts in the poll ranged from 10.5% to 31.6%, showing the considerable uncertainty around those base effects. The rebound came despite the drag from the deadly second wave of the coronavirus, which forced states across India to reimpose localised lockdowns and stop mobility completely from late April to early June. read more But unlike during the nationwide lockdown last year, repeat state-level lockdowns had a less pronounced impact on the economy as they left more room for consumers to spend. ""India's second COVID-19 wave acted as a stumbling block to the robust recovery that was underway. Still, the economic damage appears to be less than previously expected,"" said Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at Barclays. If the poll median is realised, it would be India's fastest growth since official quarterly data started being released in the mid-1990s. That's up sharply from 1.6% in the previous quarter, but a bit slower than the Reserve Bank of India's 21.4% projection. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began in April just as the economy was beginning to rally from a lull at the start of the year, throwing the recovery off course, although not as much as many feared. ""Humanitarian costs of the health crisis were high, but the economic impact was less severe than the first wave and activity rebounded faster,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank. A separate Reuters poll a month ago predicted India's GDP would expand 19.8% in the April-June quarter, little different to the latest median, and 9.4% for the current fiscal year. However, the spread of potential new virus variants poses a threat. ""The recovery remains uneven,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. ""The risks to watch out for are a third wave of COVID-19, a slower than expected pace of vaccinations, and lastly, new variants that may emerge which may not be very amenable to the vaccines which exist right now.""

Sydney hospitals erect emergency tents as COVID-19 cases hit record,3122,"SYDNEY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australia's new daily cases of COVID-19 topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first time since the global pandemic began, as two major hospitals in Sydney set up emergency outdoor tents to help deal with a rise in patients. Sydney, the country's largest city and the epicentre of the current outbreak, is struggling to stamp out a surge in the fast-spreading Delta variant, with daily infections hitting record levels even after two months under lockdown. New South Wales (NSW) state, where Sydney is the capital, reported 1,029 new locally acquired cases, exceeding the previous record of 919 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 969 were detected in greater Sydney, up from 838. The rapid rise in COVID-19 patients has forced Sydney's Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city's sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity. The makeshift unit in the emergency department for COVID-19 patients will help ""to offload delays"", a Western Sydney Local Health District spokesperson told Reuters. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities had quadrupled the number of the state's intensive care ventilators to 2,000 early last year. Although the system is ""under pressure"", it can withstand the current crisis once vaccination rates rise, she said. ""It might be different to the help you got before because of the situation, but please know the system is kicking in,"" Berejiklian said at a televised media conference. Of 116 people in intensive care in NSW, 102 are not vaccinated. Three new deaths were reported, including a man in his 30s who died at home, taking deaths from the latest outbreak to 79, although the death rate has slowed since last year. In a video posted on Twitter Wednesday night, the Australian Paramedic Association said paramedics were given a choice to wait in their vehicles with infected people or ""wait outside in the freezing rain"" due to the rise in patients. The fast-moving Delta strain has taken the gloss off Australia's early success against the virus that kept its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with some 47,700 cases and 989 deaths. About 32% of people above 16 have been fully vaccinated while just over 54% have had at least one dose. Besides Sydney, the country's second-largest city, Melbourne, and capital, Canberra, are also in hard lockdowns, putting more than half of the country's 25 million population under strict stay-at-home orders. Cases in Victoria, home to Melbourne, surged to 80 on Thursday, up from 45 a day earlier. The federal government is pushing ahead with the country's reopening plans once vaccination rates reach 70%-80%, but some states have hinted they may delay given the rapid growth of cases in Sydney. Berejiklian said NSW may reach 70% fully vaccinated by mid-October, and airline Qantas (QAN.AX) said it was preparing for international travel to resume in December. Also on Thursday, grocer Woolworths Group (WOW.AX) reported a surge in annual profit as lockdowns sparked demand for household essentials. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pfizer seeks U.S. approval for COVID vaccine booster,3059,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday said a booster dose of its two-shot COVID-19 vaccine spurs a more than threefold increase in antibodies against the coronavirus, as the company seeks U.S. regulatory approval for a third injection. The drugmaker and its German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) aim to complete the submission for use of booster shots in people aged 16 and over by the end of this week. The U.S. government has said it was gearing up to roll out the third shot of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) from mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decide that boosters are needed. That eight-month gap is likely to be narrowed to six months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. A committee of outside advisors to the CDC is scheduled to meet on Monday to review clinical data. Pfizer said 306 people given a third dose of its vaccine between five and eight months after their second shot showed levels of neutralizing antibodies that were 3.3 times the levels seen after their second shot. The study, details of which have not yet been published, also found that side effects of a third shot were similar to second-dose reactions, including mild to moderate fatigue and headache, the company said. Scientists continue to debate whether waning antibody levels mean that COVID vaccine boosters need to be given widely, but some countries are moving ahead. Israel began rolling out boosters at the beginning of August to older citizens and this week expanded the drive to people as young as 30, saying the shots were helping to increase protection against the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. U.S. President Joe Biden has said, ""It's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that may arise."" However, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the data on the benefits and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is inconclusive. The health agency called for a delay in rolling out booster shots and a goal of higher vaccination rates in countries where many had not received a first or second shot. On Monday, U.S. regulators granted full approval to Pfizer's two-dose vaccine, which has been available up until now under emergency use authorization. The approval spurred some local governments, such as New York City and the state of New Jersey, as well as the U.S. military and some companies, to mandate vaccines. A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not currently authorized for broad use in the United States. However, under the amended emergency use authorization, a third dose was authorized for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who were immunocompromised. Pfizer and BioNTech said they intend to file the data with the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities around the world in coming weeks.

"S.Korea reports highest daily COVID-19 deaths for 2021, as severe cases rise",1542,"SEOUL, Aug 26 (Reuters) - South Korea reported 20 COVID-19 deaths for Wednesday, the highest daily count this year, as the number of severe cases more than doubled since the current and worst wave of infections began in July. While total case mortality rates remain low at below 1% and no major strains on its healthcare system is reported yet, South Korean authorities have been trying to secure more ICU beds for severe patients which are on the rise along with record new infections. The number of critical or severe cases jumped to 425 as of Wednesday from 155 as of July 7, around when the fourth wave of infections began. The country has 833 intensive care beds for severe COVID-19 patients and 250 of them were available as of Tuesday, according to the health ministry. On Thursday it kicked off vaccination for people aged 18 to 49, as it aims to give at least one dose to 70% of the population and fully vaccinate 50% by September. South Korea has been struggling to boost its immunisation drive that began in February amid supply shortages and shipment delays, with about 52.7% of its 52 million people having received at least one dose, while just 26% are fully vaccinated. Of the eligible 15 million in the 18-49 age bracket, just below 70% had signed up for vaccination, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said. South Korea reported 1,882 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 243,317. A total of 2,257 people have died so far, the KDCA data showed. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Taiwan to get BioNTech shots early as China delays approval-source,3732,"TAIPEI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan could get its first delivery of BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccines one month ahead of schedule as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island, a source told Reuters. Taiwan's tortured bid for the vaccine, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), has become an issue of high political and diplomatic drama, after Taiwan accused China of blocking a deal earlier this year, which Beijing denied. China claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan's government subsequently allowed tech giants Foxconn (2317.TW), its billionaire founder Terry Gou, and TSMC (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the shot, with a $350 million deal for 10 million shots inked last month. read more More than 1 million doses, which had been originally destined for China, are expected to arrive in Taiwan between the end of August and early September, around one month earlier than initially planned, the person who has direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ""Shanghai Fosun did not manage to get approval so they gave up their plan for vaccine imports,"" the source said, referring to BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd (600196.SS). ""The original manufacturer was meant to make the delivery to Shanghai Fosun, but Fosun had to release them (the vaccines) as they didn't get the emergency use authorisation"" from China, the source added. Two other sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the supplies are due to arrive next week, but declined to say what led to the change of schedule. While BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said in April he expected its COVID-19 vaccine would win approval from the Chinese authorities ""by June at the latest"", no approval has been granted yet. It is approved in Hong Kong and Macau. It was not immediately clearly how many doses had been earmarked for delivery to China and to which other destinations the surplus would be re-directed as a result of the uncertain approval outlook. Taiwan will be among several places getting the orders ""abandoned"" by China, the first source said, who declined to name other recipients that include a European country. BioNTech and TSMC declined to comment. Fosun and China's National Health Commission did not respond to requests for comment. The made-in-Germany vaccines Taiwan will get will have labelling in the simplified Chinese characters used in China though not in Taiwan, along with the name of Shanghai Fosun, according to the first source. Responding to requests for comment for this article, Gou's spokesperson referred Reuters to Taiwan's health authorities. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters he could not say when the vaccines would arrive, as there were still some procedures that needed to be completed, and dismissed any concerns about the labelling. ""During this period of time, epidemic prevention is our only consideration. The important thing is whether the vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. The BioNTech vaccine drama has transfixed Taiwan and dominated headlines. While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control, fewer than 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated. Taiwan's government has ordered millions of vaccines itself, from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp (6547.TWO). Once the BioNTech vaccines arrive they will be donated to and administered by the government. A Taiwanese Buddhist group has also ordered 5 million doses.

"Kroger plans for 1 million Covid-19 booster shots a week, including in nursing homes",2928,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. grocery chain Kroger Co (KR.N) is gearing up to administer 1 million COVID-19 booster shots a week once they are available to the general public, and plans to offer vaccines in nursing homes for those who cannot go to its stores. The U.S. government is planning to make COVID-19 vaccine booster shots widely available from Sept. 20 to Americans if U.S. health regulators give the go-ahead. Only people who are immunocompromised have been eligible for booster shots since early this month. Retailers including Kroger, CVS Health(CVS.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance(WBA.O) and Walmart(WMT.N) are likely to play a role in administering the booster shots. Colleen Lindholz, president of Kroger Health, told Reuters in an interview that about 100 of its U.S. locations would have dedicated workers providing vaccinations all day long. Lindholz said the targeted 1 million shots a week would be twice the rate at which it had given first and second doses of the vaccine at the height of the pandemic. Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by revenue, also told Reuters it plans to provide shots in long-term care facilities. CVS and Walgreens gave most of the first and second doses of the vaccines in those facilities. ""When the vaccine first came out, we were not included in the long-term care facility deployment, but it's great this time that we can be a part of that,"" Lindholz said. ""We've reached out to facilities that we already deliver prescriptions to, or where we've done flu shot clinics in the past."" A U.S. health official said the government is planning for long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccine boosters through their usual pharmacy partners or new partners. CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in an early August interview that if boosters are approved, the company plans to be one of many pharmacies offering them in long-term care facilities. Kroger expects the bulk of the shots to be administered around the end of November through to January, coinciding with the holiday shopping season. ""We know how chaotic that will be with the holidays and so we're doing all we can to work with the CDC and Advisory Council on Immunization Practices to really influence kind of bumping that up - but obviously that's not our decision,"" Lindholz said. The CDC did not comment specifically on Kroger. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said that it has asked pharmacy partners to plan based on the idea that individuals would be eligible for boosters starting eight months after they received their second vaccine dose, subject to FDA authorization and a CDC committee recommendation on the interview. Scientists and public health officials have yet to agree that a third booster dose is needed and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said more first doses should be given around the world before wealthier nations start boosters.

Two N.Y. lawyers accused in $31 mln insurance scam,2802,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Two lawyers and two surgeons have been indicted by a federal grand jury on mail- and wire-fraud charges for allegedly participating in a five-year, $31 million insurance scam in which “extremely poor” and often homeless or drug-addicted people in New York City were recruited to stage trip-and-fall accidents, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan and the FBI’s New York office jointly announced the unsealed indictment following the arrests of attorney Marc Elefant and Drs. Andrew Dowd and Sady Ribeiro. The fourth defendant, attorney George Constantine, is expected to surrender on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in the announcement. Elefant’s attorney, Michael Bachner of Bachner & Associates, said Elefant denies the charges and “acted in good faith and in reliance on the information provided to him.” Attorneys for Constantine and Ribeiro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dowd’s attorney, Aaron Mysliwiec of Edel & Mysliwiec, declined to comment. The unsealed indictment alleges that, between 2013 and 2018, conspiracy members would identify business locations with cracked sidewalks, potholes, or other tripping hazards and recruit needy individuals to stage accidents there. The individuals - referred to as “Patients” - were required to undergo surgery to maximize the value of their claims, and received post-surgical stipends of $1,000 or $1,500, prosecutors allege. The claims were then referred to attorneys, including Constantine and Elefant, to file and settle lawsuits against the businesses and insurers, the indictment says. Constantine negotiated settlements of at least $20 million, prosecutors allege. (No figure was specified for Elefant.) The “patients” often saw little to none of that money because their medical and legal expenses were fronted by litigation funders at high rates of interest, the indictment says.

"Heart inflammation risk boosted slightly by vaccine, more by COVID-19 -study",2202,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The use of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) widely used COVID-19 vaccine marginally increases the risk of heart inflammation, but the risk is higher among those infected with the coronavirus, a study published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine showed. Among every 100,000 patients who get the vaccine, 1 to 5 will likely develop myocarditis who would not otherwise have developed it, researchers reported based on data from Clalit Health Services, a large Israeli HMO. That rate is much higher - 11 per 100,000 - among people infected with the coronavirus, they said. The data comes days after Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine became the first fully approved vaccine in the United States for people aged 16 and older, a move that could potentially persuade vaccine skeptics to get the shot. The researchers compared adverse event rates in 884,828 vaccinated individuals and an equal number of unvaccinated people. Overall, 21 persons reported myocarditis in the vaccinated group - mostly young men - compared with 6 people among the unvaccinated. Most adverse events in vaccinated people were mild, but some, such as myocarditis, are potentially serious, researchers said. The researchers also analyzed adverse event rates in more than 240,000 infected patients. The results indicate that COVID-19 infection is itself a very strong risk factor for myocarditis, and it also substantially increases the risk of other serious adverse events, they said. ""For me this is a really terrific paper in part because it actually takes data from the same system, and tries to provide more information, not just about the potential risks of vaccination, but also the potential benefits of vaccination,"" said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, whose editorial was published with the report. Pfizer's vaccine, along with a rival mRNA vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), came under regulatory scrutiny in several countries after some reports of cases of heart inflammation. Israel's health ministry said in June it saw a possible link between such cases and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

UK car output falls to lowest July level since 1950s,904,"LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - British car output fell to its lowest July level since 1956 as a global shortage of semi-conductor chips and staff having to self-isolate due to COVID-19 hit the sector, a trade industry body said on Thursday.

BOSTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the jury convictions of Insys Therapeutics Inc founder John Kapoor and four other company officials, over their roles in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe addictive opioids and defraud insurers into paying for them. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled 3-0 that ""unalloyed greed"" drove the defendants to market the fentanyl spray Subsys to ""pill mill"" doctors, who would then prescribe it to patients with no medical need. In a 138-page decision, Circuit Judge Bruce Selya wrote that Insys and Kapoor, who had been chief executive, deserved ""great credit"" for developing Subsys to treat cancer pain, but in the pursuit of profit ""turned what should have been a blessing into a curse."" Kapoor, 77, was convicted in 2019 and is serving a 5-1/2-year prison sentence. He remains the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive convicted for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic. His co-defendants Michael Gurry, Sunrise Lee, Joseph Rowan and Richard Simon were sentenced to terms of one to 2-3/4 years. A lower court judge had set aside some of the jury findings, but the appeals court restored the original verdicts. ""This decision is a decisive win that vindicates the jury's verdict and preserves a just outcome for the defendants and the victims,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell in Boston said in a statement. Kapoor's lawyer declined to comment. Lee's lawyer Peter Horstmann said ""there are no words to adequately express my displeasure with the court’s opinion."" Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors said Insys used sham ""speaker programs,"" ostensibly to educate the medical field, as a means to pay bribes and kickbacks to doctors who prescribed Subsys, often to non-cancer patients. Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers that were reluctant to pay for Subsys, prosecutors said. Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than morphine.

Man sentenced to 6 years in plot to kidnap Michigan governor,2855,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - A man who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a plot to kidnap Michigan's governor received a sentence of just over six years in prison on Wednesday, after he also agreed to testify against fellow extremists in the ""Wolverine Watchmen"" militia who have been accused in the conspiracy. Ty Garbin, 25, was the first to be convicted of scheming to abduct Gretchen Whitmer, the state's first-term Democratic governor, from her vacation home last summer. Since the FBI said it uncovered the conspiracy by members of a militia group, more than a dozen men have been charged in state or federal court. U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker in Grand Rapids handed down the sentence of 75 months Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors had sought a nine-year prison sentence for Garbin, who cooperated with the government. At the hearing, Garbin, an airplane mechanic of Hartland, Michigan, who has no criminal history, apologized to Whitmer. “I never realized what my actions would have caused to her, but also her family,"" he told the judge. ""I can’t even imagine to begin to think about the amount of stress and fear her family felt because of my actions, and for that I’m truly sorry.” Garbin broke with five co-defendants in January to submit a guilty plea to a federal kidnapping conspiracy charge. The deal included his agreement to testify against others charged in federal and state investigations, according to U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge. In the plea, Garbin said he and co-defendants were a part of a Michigan-based anti-government militia group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. The six were arrested and charged by federal authorities last October. Another eight men were hit with domestic terrorism charges in Michigan state court. All 14 are members or associates of the Wolverine Watchmen, prosecutors say. Prosecutors have said the suspected participants sought Whitmer's capture in retribution for wide-ranging public health orders imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including limits on social and business operations. Whitmer, who served as a co-chair of Joe Biden's presidential campaign, accused then-President Donald Trump of hyping up far-right groups as he denounced COVID mitigation efforts carried out in Democratic states. Officials say Garbin and others took multiple steps in planning the abduction, including a July 2020 meeting to practice using assault rifles; conducting surveillance of the governor's vacation home; and timing the distance to the nearest police station. Garbin’s plea agreement also claimed that Fox, one of the alleged ringleaders, had said at in a June meeting last year that “he wanted to recruit 200 people to storm the (Michigan) Capitol, try any politicians they caught for ‘treason’ and execute them by hanging on live television.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"After 'hard decisions' in 2020, U.S. Open returns with COVID rules eased",2861,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Fans and players will be expected to exercise caution despite COVID-19 restrictions being eased when the U.S. Open begins on Monday with capacity crowds in attendance, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) said. A year ago the tournament barred fans from attending, while players faced possible fines and expulsion if they exited the tournament's ""bubble"" without written consent as they were kept largely sequestered from New York City in Long Island accommodations. This year, they will again be able to dine at Manhattan restaurants and move freely outside their hotel rooms, with Cincinnati Masters winner Alexander Zverev enjoying seats behind home plate at the New York Mets' game against the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday. Players are required to submit to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in New York but have not been instructed to quarantine while awaiting results. Tournament director Stacey Allaster said that with almost 70% of the New York City population vaccinated, organisers were confident of staging the event safely. ""We heard loud and clear the athletes' mental health through these last 12 months, the isolation in the bubbles, was important, that they could have some flexibility,"" said Allaster. 'INFORMED DECISION' The biggest change for players and organisers is the return of fans at Flushing Meadows, which was eerily quiet in 2020. Their return means millions more in revenue for the USTA, which ran a $180 million budget deficit in 2020 as a result of hosting the tournament without spectators, USTA CEO Mike Dowse said. ""We did make a lot of hard decisions last year,"" said Dowse. ""We had significant salary reductions of our national staff, we downsized the national organization by over 23%. We tapped into our reserves."" New York City professional sports teams began welcoming back spectators months ago, with the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets opening their doors to fans in February. read more Fans at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center will not be required to show proof of vaccination or wear masks outdoors.

""It's like any other aspect of New York City, going to the baseball game, you make an informed decision.""

"Takeda must face Actos antitrust claims, 2nd Circuit says",4523,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd lost its bid at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday to escape claims that it misdescribed its patents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improperly delay generic versions of its blockbuster diabetes drug Actos. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, affirmed that Takeda's characterization of its patents was incorrect, and that distributors and health plans can pursue their claims that Takeda misused them to illegally extend Actos' patent protection, monopolize the market and charge higher prices. Takeda and its attorney Steven Reed of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Steve Shadowen of Hilliard Shadowen, representing the health plans, or Thomas Sobol of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, representing the distributors. The Hatch-Waxman Act governs generic drug approvals, under which brand-name drugmakers list their patents covering a drug in the FDA's Orange Book. Takeda listed a patent on Actos' active ingredient, pioglitazone, which expired in 2011, as well as two patents on combinations with other ingredients, which expired in 2016. Drugmakers applying to make generic versions of a drug can certify that they believe its listed patents are invalid or that the generic doesn't infringe. The brand-name drugmaker can then file an infringement action that triggers an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval. Several companies sought to make generic Actos in 2003 and 2004 and certified their products wouldn't infringe the combination patents. Teva Pharmaceuticals sought approval without such a certification, asserting it would ""carve out"" the drug combinations from its label to avoid infringement. But Takeda said the combination patents covered the drug itself, not methods of using Actos that could be carved out. It sued the generic drugmakers and eventually reached settlements that allowed them to launch generics in 2012. Drug distributors and health plans that paid for the drug sued Takeda in 2013, arguing it illegally delayed generics by misrepresenting that the combination patents were drug patents in the Orange Book, preventing the generic companies from launching their products when the active-ingredient patent expired in 2011. U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams denied Takeda's motion to dismiss the case in 2019 but allowed the company to appeal. Takeda argued to the 2nd Circuit that it correctly described the combination patents as drug patents because their claims, which outline the scope of the invention, included the active ingredient and could be infringed by an Actos generic. But Wesley, joined by Chief Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston and Circuit Judge Susan Carney, said the combination patents don't claim the drug itself because their claims are ""broader than and different from"" the scope of Actos, and affirmed that the antitrust claims could continue. Actos' active ingredient is ""but a single active chemical among the several that comprise those patents,"" Wesley said. Takeda's reading of the Hatch-Waxman Act would also ""collapse method-of-use claims into drug product claims"" and undermine the law's ""delicate balance between rewarding innovation and stimulating generic market entry,"" Wesley said. The appeals court also rejected Takeda's argument that the plaintiffs had to show its decision to list the patents was unreasonable to sustain their claims. The FDA said in 2011 that Actos increased patients' risk of bladder cancer. Takeda paid more than $2 billion in 2015 to settle U.S. claims that it failed to warn users about the risk.

Special master to consider default against Endo in opioid trial,4101,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A New York judge has appointed a special master to advise him on whether to impose default judgment or contempt against drugmaker Endo International Plc for withholding evidence in a trial over its role in the opioid epidemic. Justice Jerry Garguilo in Suffolk County Supreme Court named Joseph Maltese, a now-retired judge in the state's Appellate Division, Second Department, at a hearing Wednesday morning. Garguilo said Maltese would deliver a report and the parties would have a chance to respond. Though Garguilo did not rule, he expressed concerns about Endo's conduct. He noted that the company had been sanctioned with default judgment over similar allegations in a separate case in Tennessee, which it ultimately settled for $35 million last month. The judge said the record appeared to show that Endo became aware of relevant discovery before jury selection began in June in New York. ""If we're just before the commencement of jury selection, why doesn't somebody get on the phone to the plaintiffs and say, 'Wait a second, we just came up with some information you should have?'"" Garguilo asked. The appointment of the special master drew a strenuous objection from the New York Attorney General's office, which is suing Endo and other drugmakers alongside Nassau and Suffolk Counties. John Oleske, a lawyer for the state, called the appointment ""a last-resort extension of mercy"" to Endo that would impose ""additional burdens"" on New York as it continues to try the case while combing through late-produced evidence. New York sought default judgment on Aug. 2, accusing Endo and its attorneys at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer of dumping ""vast troves of smoking-gun evidence"" mid-trial. The company and the firm have denied that any evidence was withheld deliberately. Garguilo subsequently entered an interim order requiring Endo to provide a list of late-produced evidence with information about its chain of custody by Aug. 4. The state said Endo failed to comply and moved for contempt. Garguilo on Wednesday said he agreed Endo had not complied with the interim order, though he said he would wait for Maltese to weigh in on whether it amounted to contempt. The disputed evidence included records of Endo sales' representatives visits to New York prescribers and other internal documents. In a new filing last week, the state said it had identified a previously unproduced email from a witness, a former Endo employee, to her husband expressing concerns about the company's marketing practices. The employee nonetheless testified in a deposition that the company always adhered to regulatory standards, according to the state. More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments accusing opioid manufacturers of falsely marketing opioid drugs as safe, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being used illegally. Johnson & Johnson and the nation's three largest distributors have offered to settle claims nationwide for $26 billion. Endo and its co-defendants in the New York trial – AbbVie Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – are not part of that settlement.

Delta Air Lines to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff,4380,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not be vaccinated against COVID-19. The move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic. A number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines (UAL.O), have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has especially hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels. President Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. Hours after Delta Air announced the surcharge, Canadian rival Air Canada (AC.TO)said workers who are not vaccinated by Oct. 30 will face termination or be sent on unpaid leave. It has also made full vaccination a condition of employment for new employees. Surging coronavirus infections have clouded the outlook for airline companies. American Airlines (AAL.O)said on Wednesday its August revenue was trending below its internal forecast due to a slowdown in bookings and a rise in cancellations. The comments came two weeks after Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) issued a profit warning, citing the impact of the Delta variant on its business. Shares of U.S. airline companies, however, have risen in the past two days on hopes that Monday's full approval of the Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration would drive up the vaccination rate and slow down new infections. In a staff memo, Delta Air Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1. He said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate. Wade Symons, partner and regulatory resources group leader at global consulting firm Mercer, reckons U.S. companies have reached a ""tipping point"" for taking stricter measures to motivate employees to get vaccinated. ""We anticipate more companies will announce vaccine mandates and surcharges in the coming weeks,"" he said. The firm's data shows a quarter of U.S. employers with workforces of 500 or more charge employees extra for company-sponsored healthcare plans if they use tobacco. Delta Air did not say whether its employees were subject to any other surcharges. PROOF OF INOCULATION A Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said. Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members. But since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated. In the memo, Bastian said 75 percent of Delta Air's workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said. While Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are ""strongly encouraging"" their employees to get vaccinated. American Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform. Bastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately. Any employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12. Those who test positive for the virus will be required to isolate and remain out of the workplace, Bastian said. The company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said.

(Reuters) - Ohio-based hospital McLaren St. Luke's on Tuesday urged the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a decision that said a rival medical system did not violate antitrust law when its insurance subsidiary dropped it from its provider network. Filed by its lawyers at Honigman, St. Luke's petition seeking en banc review or panel reconsideration says the three-judge panel's Aug. 10 decision overlooked key pieces of evidence showing the alleged harm stemming from the change by the insurance arm of ProMedica Health Systems Inc. The panel ruling vacated a preliminary injunction that kept Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica from canceling contracts with St. Luke's. The case involves what the Federal Trade Commission has called an ""unsettled"" area of antitrust law: the duty, if any, owed from one firm to a competitor. The 6th Circuit panel said there is a high bar for such ""refusal to deal"" antitrust claims, since ""individuals and companies may do business with whomever they please."" In Tuesday's petition, Honigman partner David Ettinger said the panel ruling overlooked evidence that ProMedica's insurance subsidiary enjoyed ""significant benefits"" with St. Luke's as part of the provider network. Employers were attracted to the subsidiary based on its relationship with St. Luke's, according to the petition. Ettinger also argued in the petition that harm to reputation and goodwill can support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. ""It is hard to imagine how any commercial party could obtain a preliminary injunction under such a restrictive approach,” Ettinger wrote in Tuesday's court filing. Ettinger, who leads the firm's antitrust team, did not return a message seeking comment on Wednesday, and a lawyer for ProMedica at Davis Wright Tremaine did not immediately comment. The FTC in 2014 successfully challenged ProMedica's acquisition of St. Luke's as anticompetitive, and the 6th Circuit earlier upheld the commission's enforcement action. ProMedica's insurance subsidiary, Paramount Care Inc, kept St. Luke's as in-network as part of the unwinding of the merger. ProMedica ended its in-network relationship with St. Luke's after McLaren Health Systems in October 2020 agreed to buy the hospital and invest $100 million into it. McLaren's cancer services compete with ProMedica and ""could siphon off patients needing advanced care from ProMedica's hospitals,"" the 6th Circuit panel said earlier this month. Chief Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, sitting with Circuit Judges R. Guy Cole Jr and Chad Readler, ruled unanimously for ProMedica. The panel said ProMedica had a ""valid"" business reason for dropping its insurance contract with St. Luke's and that the hospital was aware a change in ownership could affect its status as an in-network provider. ""Every shrewd businessperson, and every athlete and politician to boot, intends to beat her competitors. Just so for companies, the most strategic of which hope to squash the competition by delivering a superior product,"" Sutton wrote. The case is St. Luke's Hospital v. ProMedica Health System Inc, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-3007. For ProMedica: David Gossett of Davis Wright Tremaine For St. Luke's Hospital: David Ettinger of Honigman"
FIFA's Infantino asks Premier League and LaLiga to release players for World Cup qualifiers,3497,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The English Premier League and Spain's LaLiga should release players for World Cup qualifiers next month to ""preserve and protect sporting integrity"", FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday. While the Premier League has refused to release players headed to countries on the United Kingdom's 'red list' due to strict quarantine rules on their return, LaLiga supported its clubs in refusing to release players for qualifiers in South America. ""I am calling on a show of solidarity from every member association, every league, and every club, to do what is both right and fair for the global game,"" Infantino said in a statement. ""Many of the best players in the world compete in leagues in England and Spain, and we believe these countries also share the responsibility to preserve and protect the sporting integrity of competitions around the world."" The Premier League said nearly 60 players were set to travel to 26 countries on Britain's ""red list"" while LaLiga said 25 players from 13 different clubs were affected, with more likely to follow when Ecuador and Venezuela announce their squads. read more England's strict rules would require players to quarantine for 10 days upon their return to the country, with the Premier League saying no exemption had been granted by the government for soccer players. The international break in September begins after this weekend's matches and runs for two weeks, with the Premier League resuming on Sept. 11. Premier League players would potentially miss two league matches if they quarantined on their return. The period would cover three games if the club was involved in the group stages of European club competitions which begin on Sept. 14. Italy's Serie A also released a statement later on Wednesday saying they would support clubs that do not release players who would have to quarantine on return. The league said FIFA's decision not to extend an exemption introduced last year amid the pandemic, which allowed clubs to refuse release of players for international duty on COVID-19 grounds, would put such clubs at a competitive disadvantage. The exemption allowed clubs to refuse to release players should travel restrictions be imposed or there be a mandatory period of quarantine or self-isolation of at least five days on their return. The temporary amendment was in place until April 2021. INFANTINO WRITES TO PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON Infantino said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for support. ""I have suggested that an approach similar to that adopted by the UK government for the final stages of the Euro 2020 be implemented for the upcoming international matches,"" Infantino added. London's Wembley Stadium hosted the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 last month. Official data published last week said the final was a ""superspreader"" event due to the level of COVID-19 infection found in or around the stadium on the day. Johnson has backed plans for a bid by the United Kingdom and Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup finals. The English Football League (EFL), which governs England's lower divisions, also said in a statement on Wednesday that their clubs had taken a ""collective decision not to release players for international matches"" in red-list countries. The matter first came to light on Monday when the Egyptian Football Association said Liverpool had refused to allow Mohamed Salah to travel to Africa for World Cup qualifiers.

Delta Air Lines wields Covid vaccine stick,2165,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It was always going to take effort to get some Americans on board with the Covid-19 vaccine. To all the personal and public health carrots, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) boss Ed Bastian on Wednesday added a stick. Unvaccinated U.S. employees on the company’s healthcare plan will face a $200 monthly surcharge. Bastian noted that 75% of Delta’s staff are vaccinated, that all employees hospitalized with Covid were not fully vaccinated, and that the average hospital stay has cost Delta $50,000 per person. But it goes beyond the direct costs. Delta and other travel businesses need the world to get Covid under control before they can get fully back to business. It’s also a similar justification to making health cover more expensive for smokers, and an easier argument now that Pfizer’s (PFE.N) jab is fully approved by U.S. regulators read more . Some employers have tried incentives like one-off payments . Others have simply mandated the vaccine in U.S. offices, including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) according to Reuters on Tuesday . Especially for a public-facing business like Delta's, imposing financial costs on voluntary refuseniks makes sense as the next step.

"Afghan all-girl robotics team members, journalists land in Mexico",2703,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Five members of an all-girl Afghan robotics team and more than a hundred media workers have arrived in Mexico, fleeing an uncertain future at home after the recent collapse of the U.S.-backed government and takeover by the Taliban militant group. ""We give you the warmest welcome to Mexico,"" said Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Martha Delgado as she greeted the robotics teammembers during a news conference at Mexico City's international airport late on Tuesday. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops from the country. The White House and U.S. allies are racing to complete the evacuation of all foreigners and vulnerable Afghans before an Aug. 31 deadline agreed with the Taliban, U.S. President Joe Biden said this week. read more The robotics team, made up of women and girls as young as 14, has been heralded for winning international awards for its robots and started work in March on an open-source, low-cost ventilator as the coronavirus pandemic hit the war-torn nation. The Taliban, which previously barred girls from schools and women from working when they ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s, has promised to prioritize women's rights and girls' education. Members of an Afghan all-female robotics team work on an open-source and low-cost ventilator, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Herat Province, Afghanistan April 15, 2020. Picture taken April 15, 2020.REUTERS/Jalil Ahmad/File Photo Mexico has pledged to aid Afghan women and girls. Ebrard said on Aug. 18 that the country was processing refugee applications of Afghan citizens, especially women and girls, with the aid of Guillermo Puente Ordorica, Ambassador of Mexico in Iran. Tuesday's safe arrival in Mexico was made possible by an ""extensive international effort and coordination from a group of volunteers"" who helped the girls, according to a volunteer who requested anonymity for fear of the safety of the families that remain under Taliban control. Other members of the robotics team landed in Qatar in recent days. Greeting some of the 124 journalists and staff of Afghan and foreign media outlets who arrived from Kabul a few hours after the robotics team, on Wednesday morning, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said the decision to offer refuge followed a long tradition of Mexico welcoming people fleeing persecution. ""In this case, it's people who are risking their lives to inform, to communicate. People committed to freedom of expression,"" Ebrard said.

J&J says booster dose increased antibodies in early-stage trials,3913,"CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) COVID-19 vaccine sharply increased levels of antibodies against the coronavirus, according to interim data from two small, early-stage trials, the company said in a press release on Wednesday. J&J has been under pressure to produce evidence of whether a booster shot would increase protection from its one-shot vaccine as the U.S. government prepares to roll out a booster campaign next month. The company plans to discuss the data with U.S. regulators as they devise their booster shot regimens. read more The preliminary data announced on Wednesday involved a total of 17 people. It found that a second dose of the J&J vaccine delivered six months after the first resulted in a ninefold increase in binding antibody levels over those seen 28 days after the first dose, the company said. The company did not release data on whether a second dose of its vaccine increases levels of neutralizing antibodies, which block the virus from entering cells. Those data are still being analyzed, said Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, but who was not involved in the J&J booster study. Unlike neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies tag the virus for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Barouch said increases in binding antibodies typically correlate with increases in neutralizing antibodies. Several countries, including the United States, have begun offering booster doses to vulnerable individuals, including the immunocompromised, as the Delta variant has spread and some vaccinated people have become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But those campaigns have excluded the J&J shot because there has been no evidence that a booster helps increase vaccine protection. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisers in particular have been waiting for word on how to advise immunocompromised individuals who received the J&J vaccine and are already recommended to receive a booster shot. According to J&J, the studies released Wednesday showed significant increases in binding antibody responses in participants aged 18-55 and in those 65 years and older who received a lower booster dose. The study summaries are being submitted to the preprint server MedRxiv in advance of peer review or publication in a journal. The results were released ahead of long-awaited results from J&J's large, two-dose vaccine trial. A spokesman said those results will be available in the coming weeks. In July, J&J published interim Phase 1/2a data in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed neutralizing antibodies generated by its vaccine remained stable eight months after immunization with a single dose. ""With these new data, we also see that a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine further increases antibody responses among study participants who had previously received our vaccine,"" Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&J's Janssen pharma division, said in a statement. ""We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination."" Several scientists have raised concerns that individuals who got the J&J shot would need boosters. One study by a team from New York University found a ""significant fraction"" of blood samples from recipients who got the J&J shot had low neutralizing antibodies against Delta and several other coronavirus variants. read more J&J said the company is working with the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization and other health authorities about delivering a booster shot with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

Algeria to allow more international flights in further easing of restrictions,1214,"ALGIERS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Algeria will increase the number of international flights it allows from Aug. 28, partly to help repatriate Algerians stuck abroad since air travel restrictions were imposed at the start of the pandemic last year. The country began gradually reopening its borders in June although arrivals must comply with strict health measures. State carrier Air Algerie will operate 32 international flights weekly, consisting of departures from and arrivals at three Algerian airports, the transport ministry said in a statement. It currently has nine flights arriving each week. The majority of flights, 24, will serve routes to France, where there is a large Algerian diaspora, and there will also be flights to Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, Turkey and Tunisia. Airlines from those countries will be permitted to operate the same number of flights to and from the North African nation. ""As part of reciprocity, (the number of Air Algerie flights) will be doubled by foreign airlines operating in Algeria,"" the statement said. Air Algerie suspended its international routes in March last year although it later operated some emergency flights. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID vaccine protection wanes within six months - UK researchers,3051,"LONDON (Reuters) - Protection against COVID-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months, underscoring the need for booster shots, according to researchers in Britain. After five to six months, the effectiveness of the Pfizer jab at preventing COVID-19 infection in the month after the second dose fell from 88% to 74%, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE COVID study showed. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77% to 67% after four to five months. The updated analysis was based on data from more than a million app users during the period December 8, 2020 to July 31, 2021, comparing self-reported infections in vaccinated participants with cases in an unvaccinated control group. (https://bit.ly/3kojsFV) More data is needed in younger people because participants who had their shots up to six months ago tended to be elderly as that age group was prioritised when the shots were first approved, said the study authors, who discussed the results in an online webinar (https://bit.ly/3gt4Rrp). ZOE Ltd was founded three years ago to offer customised nutritional advice based on test kits. The company's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app is a not-for-profit initiative in collaboration with King's College London and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Under a worst-case future scenario, protection could fall below 50% for older people and healthcare workers by the winter, Tim Spector, ZOE Ltd co-founder and principal investigator for the study, said. ""It's bringing into focus this need for some action. We can't just sit by and see the protectiveness slowly waning whilst cases are still high and the chance of infection still high as well,"" Spector told BBC television. Britain and other European nations are planning for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September. The U.S. government is preparing to provide third booster doses starting in mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago. ""This is a reminder that we cannot rely on vaccines alone to prevent the spread of COVID,"" said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. He cautioned that the results may have been distorted by the surge in overall cases in Britain in July. A separate British public health study found last week that protection from either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months. The Oxford University study found at the time that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively. That was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Delta to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff,2796,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not vaccinate against COVID-19. The move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic. A number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines, have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels. President Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. In a staff memo, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1. (https://bit.ly/3ybiWzW) Bastian said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate. A Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and a proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said. Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members. But since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated. In the memo, Bastian said 75% of Delta Air's workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said. While Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are ""strongly encouraging"" their employees to get vaccinated. American Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform. Bastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately. Any employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12. Those who test positive for the virus will be required to isolate and remain out of the workplace, Bastian said. The company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said."
Trial of ex-Volkswagen CEO likely to be delayed again,1617,"HAMBURG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The trial of former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn on charges of conspiracy to commit organised commercial fraud looks set to be delayed, a court probing the carmaker's diesel emissions scandal said on Wednesday. The case of the 74-year-old Winterkorn -- whom a German magazine report said needs a hip operation -- could be split off from four other Volkswagen executives who also face charges for their role in allowing diesel cars with illegal emissions-masking software to hit the road. If Winterkorn is not able to take part in the planned start of the trial on Sept. 16 due to health issues then proceedings against the other four will start without him, a court spokesperson said, although no final decision has been taken. The scandal, which was uncovered by U.S. authorities in 2015, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in refits, legal fees and settlements, and resulted in a drastic management and strategy overhaul. A lawyer for Winterkorn has said his client denied the charges. The trial had been due to start in February but has been repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Manager Magazine, which first reported on the delay, Winterkorn needs a hip operation, which would mean he would only be well enough for a trial by the middle of 2022. However, if the court waits for the completion of the trial against the other four executives, then the main proceedings against Winterkorn might only start in the second half of 2023.

"Digital mental health firms Ginger, Headspace to merge in $3 bln deal",2074,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 25 (Reuters) - Meditation app Headspace and video-based therapy services provider Ginger said on Wednesday they would merge in a deal valuing the combined company at $3 billion, as the COVID-19 pandemic spurs the use of virtual mental health care platforms. Founded in 2010, Headspace offers sessions, videos and articles on meditation and mindfulness which can be accessed on a mobile phone and has about 70 million users globally. The app has become incredibly popular in the past year and with the pandemic taking a toll on people's mental health, venture capital interest has increased in such companies. Ginger, which raised $100 million in March, provides members with access to unlimited self-guided care and 24/7 on-demand and scheduled coaching as well as video-based therapy and psychiatry support. Ginger, also founded in 2010, saw a more than four-fold rise in the number of people using its coaching services and a more than five-fold jump in therapy users in mid-July compared to the levels seen before the pandemic. Together, Ginger and Headspace will serve the employees of 2,700 companies. ""We felt like Ginger had this end-to-end mental health platform ...but if we really were going to solve this (mental health crisis) at scale, we needed to think prevention,"" said Russell Glass, chief executive officer of Ginger in an interview with Reuters. ""We needed to make sure people were getting access to care and in a much earlier part of their journey."" Russell Glass is set to helm the combined company, which would be called Headspace Health, upon the closing of the merger, expected in the last quarter of the year, the companies said. The combination with Ginger will enable Headspace to build healthy routines for people that last a lifetime, said CeCe Morken, CEO of Headspace."
WHO says no conclusive data yet on need for COVID-19 booster shot,422,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that the data on the benefits and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is inconclusive.

Vaccine inequity remains Achilles' heel of COVID-19 response in Americas-PAHO,2059,"BOGOTA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The unequal distribution of vaccines which protect against COVID-19 is the weak point in efforts to combat the disease in the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. ""Vaccine inequity remains the Achilles' heel of our response,"" PAHO Director Dr. Carissa Etienne said during the organization's weekly virtual briefing. ""A handful of companies produce all the world's supply of COVID-19 vaccines,"" Etienne said. ""Many of them are letting price and country of origin, not need, determine how doses are rolled out, so much of today's vaccine supply remains in the hands of wealthy nations around the world."" Countries are also suffering because of production delays, leaving them waiting for doses purchased months ago, she said. Almost 12 million vaccine donations from the United States, Spain, Norway, France and Sweden will not be enough to protect the hundreds of millions of people who remain vulnerable, Etienne said, adding just over 23% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean are fully vaccinated. PAHO will launch an effort to bring mRNA vaccine technology to the region and boost manufacturing efforts, she said. The situation in Haiti following an Aug. 14 earthquake which killed over 2,000 people remains serious, Etienne said. The country's health ministry has asked for additional surgical and trauma care support and PAHO is distributing supplies. Some 59 health facilities in the country's south were affected by the quake, she added, about half severely. Vaccine doses for Venezuelan migrants - millions of whom have fled their country for other parts of Latin America - are being acquired, including through the COVAX mechanism, PAHO's health emergencies director Dr. Ciro Ugarte said. It is important that undocumented migrants have access to shots, he added, not only to protect them but the communities where they live. The Americas reported over 1.5 million new COVID-19 cases last week and nearly 20,000 related deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID-19 hospitalisations fall in Russia's lone vaccine stronghold,3800,"BELGOROD, Russia, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Doctor Sergei Pashkov is on the front line of a rare success story for Russia's torpid COVID-19 vaccination campaign: In the Belgorod region where he works, 50% of adults have been fully vaccinated and pressure on hospitals has eased. The epidemiological picture in Belgorod, around 580 km (360 miles) south of Moscow, provides the best real-world evidence yet that mass inoculations of Russia's Sputnik V can reduce the number of serious COVID-19 cases. The European Union has yet to approve Sputnik V for use in the 27-nation bloc, citing the need for further information, though some individual member states have moved to buy it. ""There's practically nobody (in my infection ward),"" Pashkov, a doctor in the region's Krasnaya Yaruga district, told Reuters. In Russia, only 26% of adult residents had been fully inoculated as of Aug. 6, according to Reuters estimates. Shots have been available since January, but polls show many Russians are sceptical. By contrast, Belgorod, with a population of 1.5 million, has administered both vaccine doses, mostly Sputnik V, to 620,000 people so far and is recording fewer COVID-19 hospitalisations than other regions. The proportion of inoculated people - 50% of adults - puts it close to the 60% threshold that Moscow thinks is needed for herd immunity. World Health Organisation experts put the threshold at around 65-75%, which the Delta variant may push higher. Some experts estimate the herd immunity threshold is closer to 90% or more and that the idea of herd immunity itself may be threatened by future variants. The only place to vaccinate a bigger proportion of people with Sputnik V is the tiny Republic of San Marino that has administered the shots to most of its 34,000 population, a number too small to draw conclusions on the results of mass vaccinations. read more Authorities in Belgorod told Reuters the number of coronavirus cases per thousand people was 35.7% lower during the third wave of Russia's pandemic this summer than during the second wave last winter. Alexander Dragan, an independent data analyst, said that Belgorod had recorded the slowest increase in hospitalisations of any Russian region during this summer's case surge, citing an analysis of official data that he conducted. DOCTORS FINALLY ABLE TO REST Five doctors at four hospitals in the region told Reuters that they have had increases in COVID-19 cases but they were much lower than a surge in winter that they linked to vaccinations. ""The burden has become more even... Some doctors can even go on holiday,"" said Alyona Bogomazova, deputy chief doctor at Borisovka hospital. Russia does not publish nationwide hospitalisation figures. But the local administration said that the number of COVID-19 hospital in-patients was 30% lower in August than January. For comparison, Moscow recorded a much smaller drop of 6.2% fewer hospitalisations in June from December, according to Reuters estimates based on official data. Roman Protsenko, the head doctor of Belgorod city's hospital, said that the number of people in his intensive care unit had not fallen however. He said he thought that was because the virus had become more aggressive. He also said that only 1.8% of his in-patients had been vaccinated. Belgorod was one of the first Russian regions where authorities tried to boost vaccine uptake by giving additional payments to medical workers in May for administering more injections. Vaccinations in the region have remained officially voluntary unlike in dozens of other regions where they are mandatory for some. Belgorod's authorities say nobody has been forced to have the shots, but five people said earlier this year that they had come under pressure. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
In-form Barty prepared for U.S. Open success,3960,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Australian Ash Barty appears primed to be the most consistent women's number one since Serena Williams as she heads into the U.S. Open, while Naomi Osaka faces a difficult challenge in her title defence with a handful of contenders vying for their first Grand Slam title. Former world number one Karolina Pliskova and 23-year-old Aryna Sabalenka are seen as potential threats to rattle the field, even though Barty will be rolling into Flushing Meadows on a wave of momentum. Barty faced questions at the start of 2021 when she returned to competitive tennis having not played a match for 11 months but still holding the top women's singles ranking during last year's COVID-disrupted season. The 25-year-old Queenslander has laid all those doubts to rest with a tour-leading five WTA titles in 2021, including her second major title overall at Wimbledon, cementing her spot at the top and widening her lead over the chasing pack. The Australian was comfortable with her decision to not travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but since leaving her country in March Barty has been on the road. ""I think there was probably a part of me that was a little bit unsure of how this year would go for a couple of reasons,"" she told the WTA Insider after her Cincinnati win. ""One being, seven to eight months out of the tour last year, and two, being in a completely new adventure, a new scenario, a new feeling for me of being away from home for so long."" Barty is the bookmakers' favourite for a victory which would also give her a major trophy on all surfaces, with her maiden Slam coming at the 2019 French Open. ""I know the work that I've put in with my team. That's where all the gold lies. That's where all of our good stuff hides,"" said Barty, who claimed the No.1 ranking for the first time in June, 2019. While Barty has found the calmness and mental steel to handle the huge burden of expectations, Osaka has struggled with mental health issues, disclosing earlier this year that she has long suffered from bouts of depression. Osaka was marked as the heir apparent to Williams when she beat the American 23-times major winner in New York in 2018 for the first of her four Grand Slam titles. She has been unparalleled in recent years when it comes to success on hard courts and the Japanese has won four out of the last six hardcourt majors. Osaka won the 2021 Australian Open but then withdrew from the French Open and skipped Wimbledon. The 23-year-old failed to get past the third round of the Tokyo Olympics or last week's Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. ""These last few months obviously have been extremely difficult,"" ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver told reporters about Osaka. ""But she's going back to a place where she's won it twice.

Osaka's uneven play casts shadow over latest U.S. Open bid,2599,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Questions abound as Naomi Osaka prepares to mount a title defence at the U.S. Open following a series of lacklustre performances since she returned to the game after stepping away to focus on her mental health. Osaka shot to global fame on the back of her four Grand Slam titles and support of racial justice causes, with many seeing the hard-hitting 23-year-old as the heir apparent to Serena Williams. The Japanese player won the Australian Open earlier this year before opening up a conversation about mental health when she withdrew from the French Open and admitted she had struggled in the past with depression. She skipped Wimbledon but, since returning, has failed to get past the third round of the Tokyo Olympics or last week's Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. ""Osaka obviously has been having some struggles that she's come forward with. It's a little unpredictable,"" ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver told reporters on a call. ""But she's going back to a place where she's won it twice. Usually when you have those kind of special memories, you can play some pretty good tennis,"" she said. Osaka defeated Williams at Flushing Meadows in 2018 for the first of her two U.S. Open titles in a final where the American clashed with the chair umpire. World number two Osaka was praised for keeping her composure throughout the incident. ""I expect her to play well,"" Shriver said. ""But I do have more questions going into this U.S. Open than I would have had the last few months been smoother for Naomi."" OSAKA UPBEAT Osaka herself struck an upbeat tone after falling to Jil Teichmann in Cincinnati last week, saying the flip side of not having as many matches under her belt was that she was healthy. Osaka was hampered at last year's U.S. Open by a left hamstring injury. ""Last year, I played a lot of matches before the Open, and then I injured myself. So I don't really want to go through that again, even though it worked out,"" Osaka told reporters. She said the key was to stay grounded in the moment. ""I'm going into the tournament and taking it one match at a time, that's how I play really well,"" she said. ESPN analyst and former world number one John McEnroe said of Osaka: ""She needs to win a close one. She was double match point down against (Garbine) Muguruza at the (fourth round of the) Australian Open and pulled that out. Then she got on a roll. ""I think if she's going to do well, it's going to have to be one of those situations,"" he added. The U.S. Open runs from Monday until Sept. 12. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Brazil to give COVID-19 booster shots to elderly and vulnerable,1771,"SAO PAULO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Brazil will give booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to people with compromised immune systems and those over the age of 70 beginning inmid-September, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. Vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), or Pfizer (PFE.N) will be used for the booster shots, the ministry said in a statement. The information differs from remarks on Tuesday byHealth Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who had said vulnerable people and over 80-year-olds would receive an additional jab of the Pfizer. The rapid spread of the Delta variant and new research suggesting diminished effectiveness of vaccines over time has led many countries to propose an additional dose to reinforce protection. Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine, which was used for many elderly people in Brazil because it was the earliest available in large quantities, is not part of the plans outlined for the booster shots. The extra shots will be administered to those with vulnerable immune systems 28 days after their second dose. For those 70 and over, the ministry stipulated a six-month interval before applying a booster shot. Also starting next month, the gap between the first and second shots of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines will fall to eight weeks from 12 weeks for all those vaccinated in Brazil. Brazil has had more than 20.6 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 575,000 fatalities due to the virus. According to data from the Health Ministry, 123.9 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil, or about 59% of the population. Some 55.7 million had been completelyimmunized, or about 26.5% of the country's population, the data showed. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Supreme Court requires Biden to revive Trump's 'remain in Mexico' immigration policy,3704,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied President Joe Biden's bid to rescind an immigration policy implemented by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico awaiting U.S. hearings. The court, with three liberal justices dissenting, rejected the Biden administration's effort to block a Texas-based judge's ruling requiring the government to revive Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump. The brief order by the justices means that U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling now goes into effect. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it regretted the Supreme Court's decision and would continue to ""vigorously challenge"" the district court ruling. As the appeals process continues, it said, the agency will comply with the order ""in good faith"" and has begun discussions with Mexico. The court's decision referenced its 2020 ruling that thwarted Trump's bid to end a program introduced by Democratic former President Barack Obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants - often called “Dreamers” - who entered the United States illegally as children. Both cases concern whether the government followed the correct legal process in unwinding a previous administration's policy. A migrant boy, an asylum seeker sent back to Mexico from the U.S. under the ""Remain in Mexico"" program officially named Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), is seen near two members of the Mexican National Guard at a provisional campsite near the Rio Bravo in Matamoros, Mexico February 27, 2020. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo Biden, who has sought since taking office in January to reverse many of Trump's hardline immigration policies, rolled back the MPP program. Republican-led Texas and Missouri challenged the Democratic president's move. Biden's administration turned to the Supreme Court after Kacsmaryk ruled that the Trump policy would have to be reinstated and the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 denied the government's request for a delay. The 5th Circuit's decision said the Biden administration must implement the MPP program in ""good faith,"" which leaves the government some discretion in how to move forward. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized MPP, saying the policy subjected migrants, primarily from Central America, to dangerous conditions in Mexican border cities. Trump's administration cited a ""security and humanitarian crisis"" along the U.S.-Mexican border in refusing to allow migrants seeking asylum, because of a fear of persecution in their home countries, to enter the United States ahead of hearings before immigration judges. Reacting to the Supreme Court's order, Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the Trump policy during the previous administration, said the Biden administration must ""take all steps available to fully end this illegal program, including by re-terminating it with a fuller explanation."" Arrests of migrants caught crossing the U.S. southern border have reached 20-year highs in recent months, a development that Republicans blame on Biden's reversal of MPP and other Trump immigration policies. Biden's administration has left in place a separate Trump-era order that lets U.S. border authorities, because of the COVID-19 public health crisis, rapidly expel migrants caught at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum in the United States.

"Woman who aided Islamic State skips hearing, US fears she cut GPS bracelet",1920,"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A Brooklyn woman who will be resentenced for supporting Islamic State after a court threw out her ""shockingly low"" four-year prison term did not attend a Wednesday court hearing, and a prosecutor suggested she may have cut her monitoring bracelet. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said she will issue a bench warrant for Sinmyah Amera Ceasar, 26, who prosecutors have said used the name ""Umm Nutella"" in her role as a ""committed recruiter"" for Islamic State. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian Richardson said Ceasar was not responding to calls and the government believed her GPS tracking bracket had been ""tampered with"" and perhaps cut. He said the FBI and probation officials are looking for it. Samuel Jacobson, a federal public defender representing Ceasar, said he believed his client knew she had a court date. ""I can't say for sure that she understood the specifics,"" he said. Ceasar received her four-year term from late U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who cited her need for educational and mental health support after a lifetime of abuse. But the federal appeals court in Manhattan threw out the sentence on Aug. 18, saying it was too short relative to ""similar terrorism crimes"" and failed to properly address the needs to ensure just punishment. read more Prosecutors want Ceasar detained, saying she is a flight risk and danger to the community, and has repeatedly violated probation conditions since being freed from prison in July 2020 after being sentenced about a year earlier. She had received credit for time served. Matsumoto said she was ""concerned that additional violations ... have occurred as recently as July.""

"Canada's Royal Bank, National Bank profits beat estimates on provisions, loans",2807,"TORONTO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) and National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) both beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven primarily by the release of provisions set aside to cover bad loans. Earnings excluding the impact of provisions for both banks rose from a year ago, but Royal Bank's performance was viewed more positively by analysts as it was driven by higher fee income and lower expenses. At National Bank, lower net interest income and increased expenses somewhat eroded the benefit of higher fees. Both banks benefited from revenue growth in their personal and commercial banking divisions, as a pick-up in lending offset margin challenges. The more modest performances in their wealth management and capital markets businesses were largely expected, although National Bank's disappointed more than Royal Bank's. On Tuesday, Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia both beat estimates, with the former also posting strong pre-tax pre-provision (PTPP) earnings growth, while the latter's performance was driven almost entirely by lower provisions for credit losses (PCL). read more Royal Bank shares rose 1.2% to C$133.60 in morning trading in Toronto, on track for a record close, while National Bank's fell 0.7% to C$99.05. The Toronto stock benchmark (.GSPTSE) was flat. The outsized positive impact on earnings of the releases of reserves previously set aside to cover bad loans is expected to fade in coming quarters, and markets are focused on loan growth and fee revenues to determine the future health of Canadian banks. PTPP earnings at Royal Bank, Canada's biggest lender by market value, rose 6% from a year ago but fell 1% from the prior quarter. PTPP earnings at National Bank, the smallest of the country's Big Six lenders, were 15% higher than a year earlier but flat on the previous quarter. Analysts expected PTPP earnings across the country's biggest lenders would fall about 1% from the second quarter. While both banks released loan-loss reserves as impairments remained low, Royal Bank's came with some caution. ""While pandemic-related uncertainty has declined... uncertainty does remain elevated due to a rise in cases of the COVID-19 delta variant,"" Royal Bank's Chief Risk Officer Graeme Hepworth said on an analyst call. He added that impaired loan provisions are expected to trend above the bank's long-term average in 2022 as a result, but that this is expected to be offset by releases on performing loans. Royal Bank reported adjusted earnings of C$3 a share, up from C$2.23 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of C$2.71. read more National Bank had adjusted income of C$2.36 per share, versus C$1.66 a year earlier.

COVID vaccine protection wanes within six months - UK researchers,2898,"LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Protection against COVID-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months, underscoring the need for booster shots, according to researchers in Britain. After five to six months, the effectiveness of the Pfizer jab at preventing COVID-19 infection in the month after the second dose fell from 88% to 74%, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE COVID study showed. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77% to 67% after four to five months. The study was based on data from more than a million app users, comparing self-reported infections in vaccinated participants with cases in an unvaccinated control group. More data is needed in younger people because participants who had their shots up to six months ago tended to be elderly as that age group was prioritised when the shots were first approved, the study authors said. ZOE Ltd was founded three years ago to offer customised nutritional advice based on test kits. The company's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app is a not-for-profit initiative in collaboration with King’s College London and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Under a worst-case future scenario, protection could fall below 50% for older people and healthcare workers by the winter, Tim Spector, ZOE Ltd co-founder and principal investigator for the study, said. ""It's bringing into focus this need for some action. We can't just sit by and see the protectiveness slowly waning whilst cases are still high and the chance of infection still high as well,"" Spector told BBC television. Britain and other European nations are planning for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September. The U.S. government is preparing to provide third booster doses starting in mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago. ""This is a reminder that we cannot rely on vaccines alone to prevent the spread of COVID,"" said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. He cautioned that the results may have been distorted by the surge in overall cases in Britain in July. A separate British public health study found last week that protection from either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months. The Oxford University study found at the time that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively. That was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Moderna completes filing process for full approval of COVID-19 vaccine,1318,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) has completed the real-time review process needed for a full approval for its COVID-19 vaccine in people aged 18 years and above, the company said on Wednesday. The news comes within days of U.S. regulators granting full approval to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine, developed with the same mRNA technology as Moderna's. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines prompt the human body to make a protein that is part of the pathogen, triggering an immune response. U.S. health officials expect full approval for COVID-19 vaccines will help win over vaccine skeptics and prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. Moderna's completed submission includes data from a late-stage study that showed 93% vaccine efficacy, even through six months after administration of the second dose, the company said in a statement. As part of the submission, Moderna has requested a priority review designation for its vaccine, currently available in the United States for people aged 18 and older under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA in December. So far, the company has released more than 300 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Top Japan adviser blasts visit by IOC's Bach as COVID curbs expand,4427,"TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Japan's top medical adviser blasted International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach on Wednesday for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. In an unusually blunt statement from a Japanese official, Dr Shigeru Omi suggested Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony had undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC said Bach's visit had been authorised by the Japanese government and was meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. ""We had said over and over 'What kind of message will the Olympics send to the public?'"" Omi, the immunologist who chairs the government's coronavirus advisory panel that approved the emergency plan, said in a parliamentary session. ""We're asking people to work from home more. If (IOC) President Bach needs to give a speech (for the Paralympics), why couldn't he do it remotely? Why does he have to bother coming all the way here?"" Omi said, drawing applause from a few lawmakers. ""That kind of plain, common sense should function under these circumstances,"" he said. Bach spent over a month in Japan for the Olympic Games, which finished on Aug. 8. The IOC said on Wednesday his latest visit was ""part of the support of the IOC to the Paralympic Games and the Paralympic athletes and the strong cooperation between the IOC and the IPC"". Omi's comments underscored the frustration felt by many as the government grapples to bring infections under control. Citizens are growing weary of life under restrictions and companies are ignoring requests to promote work-from-home. Omi had voiced strong concerns about holding the 2020 Games, while others in the medical community opposed them. He had warned that infections could spread as the public interpreted hosting the Games as a sign that it was safe enough to go about their normal activities. HOSPITALS NEAR CAPACITY Nomura Research Institute executive economist Takahide Kiuchi estimated the latest state-of-emergency expansion would lead to an additional economic loss of about 420 billion yen ($3.8 billion), bringing the total fallout from Japan's fourth round of emergency curbs to 3.84 trillion yen. That dwarfs the 1.68-trillion-yen boost the economy was expected to see from holding the Olympic and Paralympic Games, he estimated. The government will decide this week to tap an additional 1.4 trillion yen from reserves for the additional costs of dealing with the pandemic, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said, adding that about 60% of the public will be fully vaccinated by the end of September. ""I've done my utmost to promote coronavirus vaccination,"" he said. Still, months of emergency curbs in Tokyo and surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of the city's critical care beds are occupied. The latest state-of-emergency expansion will add Hokkaido, Aichi, Hiroshima and five other prefectures starting from Friday through to Sept. 12. Another four prefectures will be placed under more limited ""quasi-emergency"" measures, bringing the regions under those curbs to a total of 12 out of Japan's 47 prefectures. ""Maintaining the health system is the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Suga said. With hospital beds filled to or nearing capacity, many people have been forced to convalesce at home with some dying before they can get treatment. Securing oxygen stations and nurses, as well as considering the use of antibody cocktails for outpatients, were among the priorities, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said earlier. ""The working-age demographic is the driving force (behind the rise in infections),"" Nishimura said. ""We need to halve the movement of people."" He added that infections transmitted by children as new school terms start were another concern. Omi, the medical adviser, later said it was important to give vaccines to teachers, including at nursery schools. He also backed antibody tests ahead of physical activities at schools. The government reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths for Tuesday. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Just over half the Swiss population has been fully vaccinated, Health Minister Alain Berset said, but a third of adults remained unjabbed. He pointed to lower vaccination rates than in neighbouring countries. ""There are still very many people who could be infected,"" he told a news conference in Bern, adding 90% of COVID-related hospital and intensive care unit admissions related to individuals who had not received the vaccine. read more The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtenstein rose by 3,212 on Wednesday, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. The Swiss COVID-19 certificate provides proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test result. The requirement would cover events as well as indoor areas of restaurants and bars. Recreational sites like cinemas and museums, sports centres and cultural activities could be affected, the government said as it launched consultations with regional authorities which will run until Aug. 30. ""There are no short cuts in a pandemic,"" Berset said, saying the certificates were an important tool to avoid resorting to broader lockdowns as hospitals get swamped. ""The pressure would be massive, the situation would be absolutely chaotic,"" he said. The agreement with Pfizer for delivery of 7 million doses in both 2022 and 2023, with an option to double that, remains subject to a modified Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being authorised for use by drugs regulator Swissmedic, the government said.

""The renewed agreement advances the fundamental elements that made the accord successful."" The original agreement, known as the Bangladesh Accord, was due to expire on Aug. 31. The new version comes into force on Sept. 1. and is named the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry to reflect its wider reach. Some 200 retailers signed up to the accord in 2013, including retail giants H&M (HMb.ST), Inditex (ITX.MC), Fast Retailing's Uniqlo (9983.T), Hugo Boss (BOSSn.DE), and adidas (ADSGn.DE). A list of those that have also signed up to the extension will be made available on Sept. 1, sources said. A spokesperson for Uniqlo said they had not yet seen the new accord, but they ""generally support a new binding agreement... that has independent oversight and can be expanded to other countries."" H&M, Inditex, Hugo Boss and adidas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The five-year accord, struck in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 that killed more than 1,100 garment workers, instituted an independent body that held thousands of inspections and banned unsafe factories from supplying its signatory buyers. That helped to make some 1,600 factories safer for 2 million workers, labour activists say. Under a transition deal agreed in 2018 after the original accord expired, a newly-formed body, the Ready-Made Garments Sustainability Council (RSC), which brings together unions, brands, and factory owners, took over the work of running factory inspections. However, the RSC did not take over one portion of the accord - the ability for retailers to be tried in court in the country in which they are domiciled if they fail to meet their obligations, including cutting ties with factories that do not meet the accord's standards. Signatories also agreed to discuss within six months to which countries the accord could be extended, with the aim of establishing it in at least one other country within two years, it said. Negotiations over the accord's extension stalled in May when U.S. retailers resisted agreeing to the legally-binding aspect of the agreement, sources said. read more Retailers, including Target (TGT.N), Walmart (WMT.N), VF Corp (VFC.N), which did not want to sign the original accord in 2013 formed a parallel alliance with similar functions, but no legal powers of enforcement. Those leading the talks had hoped to negotiate an extension that U.S. retailers would also be willing to adopt, sources said in May. But Walmart told Reuters on Tuesday it was not part of the accord's extension. Target and VF Corp did not respond to requests for comment. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Japan PM, ruling party executive hold talks on party leadership race",2495,"TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga held talks on Wednesday with a powerful ruling party executive on a party leadership vote that will decide who leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the next election due by November. The ruling LDP vote is expected to take place on Sept. 29. The executive, Toshihiro Nikai, said this week he backs Suga's re-appointment as party chief, a position ensuring Suga would stay on as prime minister and take the party helm in the looming general election. Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri daily, said on Wednesday that in addition to Nikai's faction, the leadership of four other main groups in the LDP also favoured Suga for the top job, although younger, more vulnerable MPs opposed the unpopular premier. Suga took office last September after Shinzo Abe quit, citing ill health, and his term expires at the end of next month. The premier's ratings have fallen below 30% as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 infections, and some in the party want to replace him before the general election. There had been speculation that Suga may aim to first call a general election, win a majority of seats, then use the victory to help him win another term as party leader. But Kyodo news agency, citing unnamed sources, said late on Tuesday Suga was not planning to dissolve the lower house of parliament, a key step for calling a snap election, before the party leadership vote. This arrangement appeared to have been confirmed during the talks on Wednesday, where Suga and Nikai agreed the party leadership race would go ahead, Kyodo said. At an evening news conference on the expansion of the COVID-19 state of emergency to eight more prefectures, Suga remained vague on the timing of the elections. ""As for dissolving the lower house of parliament and holding a general election, choices are getting slim. I've been saying repeatedly that the top priority is our coronavirus response. I want to decide with that in mind,"" he said. Suga has repeatedly said he will run in the leadership contest for another term, though a former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, has firmed up his decision to challenge him in the party vote, according to public broadcaster NHK. LDP members of parliament and grassroots party members are expected to be eligible to vote in the poll. Nikai played a central role in ensuring Suga's victory in the previous LDP leadership race last year. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Sydney hospitals battle coronavirus as daily infections hit record,3583,"SYDNEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Sydney's COVID-19 infections hit a daily record on Wednesday, putting parts of the health system under pressure, officials said, calling for vaccinations to be stepped up to stem the tide of hospital admissions. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, New South Wales (NSW) state reported 919 new cases amid a growing Delta variant outbreak, taking Australia's daily case numbers to a new pandemic high just below 1,000. New infections in greater Sydney reached 838, eclipsing Sunday's record of 830 cases for the whole state. Some 85% of the state's total infections lie in greater Sydney. A total of 113 people in the state are in intensive care, with 98 of those unvaccinated. ""This highlights ... the fact that vaccination is the key. We need to increase those vaccine coverage levels,"" NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said during a televised media briefing in Sydney, the state capital. Australia, grappling to control a third wave of the coronavirus, has locked down more than half of its 25 million population, including its largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and is accelerating an initially sluggish vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at least one dose. Westmead Hospital, one of the largest in Sydney's hard-hit western suburbs, has reduced ambulance arrivals for COVID-19 patients for 24 hours and shifted critical patients to other hospitals, an internal note shared on Twitter by NSW lawmaker Cate Faehrmann showed. Asked about the changes, state Health Minister Brad Hazzard acknowledged the health system is working under pressure but said the situation is still manageable. A masked woman with an umbrella walks with a child through the quiet city centre during a lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Sydney, Australia, August 24, 2021. REUTERS/Loren Elliott ""Westmead Hospital is typical of the sorts of pressures you would expect when you got a major hospital in the middle of the epicentre of the virus outbreak,"" he said. Around 80% of cases have been detected in Sydney's west. In neighbouring Victoria, new cases fell for a second straight day to 45, down from 50 a day earlier, as officials sought to boost the vaccine rollout by allowing anyone over 16 to book an appointment from Wednesday. REOPENING PLANS The spike in cases comes as Australia's federal government pressed states to stick to a four-stage national reopening plan agreed last month, as some have suggested delays given the persistently high new daily case numbers in Sydney. read more Treasurer Josh Frydenberg warned state leaders on Wednesday that current emergency economic supports may be withdrawn when the country hits a 70%-80% COVID-19 vaccination rate, even if states and territories decide to retain border controls. ""There should be no expectation on behalf of premiers and chief ministers that our emergency economic support will continue at the scale that it is currently,"" Frydenberg told broadcaster Seven News. Despite the recent Delta outbreaks, Australia's coronavirus numbers are still relatively low, with just over 46,600 cases and 986 deaths. Deaths from the latest outbreak have risen to 76, although the death rate has slowed from last year. Virus-free Queensland said it would pause arrivals from NSW and Victoria states, and the Australian Capital Territory for two weeks from Wednesday to help ease pressure on its hotel quarantine system.

"Denmark, Costa Rica seek alliance to speed up the end of oil and gas",5202,"BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Denmark and Costa Rica are trying to forge an alliance of countries willing to fix a date to phase out oil and gas production and to stop giving permits for new exploration, government ministers said and documents showed. Burning fossil fuels is the main source of the greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet, but so far there has been no collective government action to end oil and gas production. ""Restricting domestic oil and gas production in line with what is required to live up to the Paris Agreement goals will be the core focus for BOGA,"" a draft of the rules for the alliance said, referring to the group's name - the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA). Industry and governments are moving too slowly to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit), which scientists say requires the world to reach net zero emissions by 2050. read more The International Energy Agency has said there should be no new investments in fossil fuel supply projects anywhere in the world if the Paris targets are to be met. read more The draft document seen by Reuters said a core task for the BOGA would be to establish a deadline for developing and developed countries to phase out existing oil and gas production that would align them with the Paris goals. To become a full member of the alliance, countries must promise to end new licensing rounds for oil and gas production on their territories, as well as to phase out existing production, the draft said. The draft could change before the expected launch of the BOGA at the U.N. climate summit in November in Glasgow, Scotland. Countries could become second-tier members if they have taken some steps to limit oil and gas output, such as ending public financing of it abroad or reforming fossil fuel subsidies. LEVEL OF SUPPORT UNCLEAR Danish climate and energy minister Dan Jorgensen told Reuters Denmark, which is co-leading the initiative with Costa Rica, was talking to many countries, but it was too early to say how many would join the alliance. One of the largest European oil and gas producers, Denmark last year banned new North Sea oil and gas exploration and committed to ending its existing production by 2050. ""Very few countries have taken such steps and we hope that this alliance will be something that will be noticed and hopefully inspire others to join,"" Jorgensen said. Costa Rica has never extracted oil, but is considering a bill to permanently ban fossil fuel exploration to ensure no future governments do so. ""Costa Rica represents the commitment and decision of a developing country that has the possibility to explore, makes a brave decision and decides to go for another development model and rides into the economy of the future,"" Costa Rica's environment minister Andrea Meza said. New Zealand, which banned new permits for offshore oil in 2018, told Reuters it had been approached by Denmark and was ""in the process of learning more about this initiative"". Costa Rica's Meza said the countries the alliance had approached included Portugal and Spain. Spain did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Portugal said it had not applied for membership of the alliance yet. The United Kingdom, which is hosting the U.N. climate summit December and has not committed to phase out its oil and gas production or halt exploration, declined to comment on its involvement. A UK government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the government is engaging with Denmark on the alliance. However, some large producers - including Norway, western Europe’s top oil and gas producer, are not yet involved. ""We’ve not been contacted in this regard,"" Norwegian deputy energy minister Tony Tiller told Reuters. PARADOXIAL SITUATION As a coalition of the willing, BOGA is unlikely to touch major oil and gas producers, such as Saudia Arabia or Russia, whose economies depend on fossil fuels, and which have shown no interest in curbing production. But part of BOGA's aim is to redefine what counts as climate leadership from goverments. Large countries' climate change targets tend to focus on reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels, but rarely limit the production of the fuels themselves. ""We are in a paradoxical situation right now where many countries have pledged to become carbon neutral but are actually still planning to produce oil and gas after that date,"" Jorgensen said. The United States, the world's largest producer of both oil and gas, this year pledged to halve its emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels. The U.S. government did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is involved in BOGA. Of the few countries that have taken action to ban fossil fuel exploration and production, France has committed to do so by 2040, and Spain by 2042.

Thailand develops robotic system to squeeze out more vaccine doses,3033,"BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - As Thailand struggles with its worst coronavirus outbreak yet, researchers in the country have developed a machine to draw out COVID-19 vaccine doses more efficiently and optimise lower-than-expected supplies. Using a robotic arm, the ""AutoVacc"" system can draw 12 doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine in four minutes from a vial, according to researchers at Chulalongkorn University, who made the machine that has been used at the university's vaccination centre since Monday. That is up 20% from the standard 10 doses drawn manually, they said. The machine only works on AstraZeneca multi-dose vials currently and labels show each vial can provide 10 to 11 doses. ""The machine guarantees with accuracy that we can gain an extra 20% from each vaccine vial - from 10 to 12 doses,"" said Juthamas Ratanavaraporn, the lead researcher of the team at the university's Biomedical Engineering Research Center.""The extra 20% that we get means that if we have AstraZeneca for 1 million people, this machine can increase the number of doses to 1.2 million people,"" said Juthamas. While some health workers using low dead space syringes (LDSS) that aim to reduce wastage can draw up to 12 doses per vial, it requires manpower and a high level of skill, she said. ""This could drain a lot of the health workers' energy. They would have to do this every day for many months,"" Juthamas said. Thailand had kept COVID-19 largely under control for much of the pandemic, but more virulent variants like Delta have sent cases and deaths soaring since April, ramping up pressure on authorities to increase the pace of vaccinations. A vaccine extraction machine called AutoVacc, designed by the Chulalongkorn University's Biomedical Engineering Research Center to extract extra doses out of AstraZeneca vaccine vials, is seen in Bangkok, Thailand August 23, 2021. Picture taken August 23, 2021. REUTERS/Juarawee Kittisilpa So far, around 9% of Thailand's population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated, with the rollout hindered by lower-than-anticipated vaccine supplies. The research team say they should be able to produce 20 more AutoVacc units within three or four months, but that government funds and support would be needed to expand across the country. The prototype machine costs 2.5 million baht ($76,243), including other materials like syringes, said Juthamas, adding that while they were open to export opportunities, that was something for the future. They also plan to make similar machines to use with the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines, she added. Juthamas said the machine was aimed at removing burdens on health workers. Thailand has reported around 1.1 million COVID-19 infections and 10,085 deaths in total, pushing parts of the health system to the brink. ""When the health workers are too tired, there are also chances of human error, so we should let the machines work on this,"" she said.

"U.S., China accuse each other of 'bullying' nations",5019,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday again charged China with bullying its Southeast Asian neighbours, the second time in two days she has attacked Beijing during a regional visit, as Washington tries to rally regional partners to take on China's growing economic and military influence. The Chinese foreign ministry shot back on Wednesday and accused the U.S. of meddling in regional affairs and disrupting peace. Earlier in the day, Chinese state media accused Harris of seeking to drive a wedge between China and Southeast Asian nations with comments in Singapore that Beijing used coercion and intimidation to back its unlawful South China Sea claims. Speaking in Hanoi on Wednesday, Harris said there was a need to mount pressure on China over its maritime claims and offered to support Vietnam in several key areas, including enhancement of maritime security to take on Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. ""We need to find ways to pressure, raise the pressure…on Beijing to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to challenge, its bullying and excessive maritime claims,"" said Harris during a meeting with Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Harris offered Vietnam more visits by U.S. warships and aircraft carriers, vaccines and aid to tackle COVID-19 and announced the launch of several programs to help combat climate change, according to a White House official who did not wish to be named. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to take on China globally. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contains gas fields and rich fishing grounds. China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea and objects to foreign warships sailing through what it claims is its sovereign waters. The U.S. Navy regularly conducts ""freedom of navigation"" operations through the disputed waters, which China objects to, saying they do not help promote peace or stability. In 2016, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled against China's claim, but Beijing has rejected the ruling. ""While pointing a finger at China and accusing it of 'coercion' and 'intimidation', Harris wilfully ignored her own hypocrisy in attempting to coerce and intimidate regional countries to join Washington in its scheme to contain China,"" the state run China Daily said in an editorial responding to Harris's comments in Singapore. Harris's Singapore speech was a baseless attack on China, the editorial said. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris arrives for the second leg of her Asia trip, in Hanoi, Vietnam, August, 24, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/Pool ""It seems that the United States' only commitment to Southeast Asia is its dedicated efforts to drive a wedge between the Southeast Asian nations and China,"" it added. The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century as it cements its pivot towards Asia. Southeast Asia has seen a series of high-profile visits by top administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who visited Hanoi in late July. Harris's arrival in Hanoi was delayed on Tuesday after the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam said it had detected an ""anomalous health incident"", potentially related to the mysterious Havana Syndrome. read more During the delay, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China's ambassador to Vietnam held a previously unannounced meeting, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not take sides in foreign policy. The Chinese ambassador promised a donation of 2 million COVID-19 vaccines during the meeting. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and Vietnam is heavily reliant on materials and equipment from China for its manufacturing activities. Their ruling Communist Parties maintain close ties, but Vietnam and China have been embroiled in a longstanding dispute over maritime claims in the South China Sea. The tensions have propelled Vietnam into being one of the most vocal opponents of Beijing's claims in the disputed waterway and Hanoi has received U.S. military hardware, including coastguard cutters. On Wednesday, Harris offered the deployment of a third U.S. Coast Guard cutter, a fleet of 24 patrol boats, base facilities, piers, law enforcement training and other joint activities that help Vietnam bolster its maritime security. Ties between Hanoi and Washington have grown closer more than four decades after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, and Vietnam has quietly endorsed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy because it takes a hard line against China in the disputed waters. Analysts say Vietnam wants to upgrade its diplomatic relationship with the United States to a ""strategic partnership"" but is concerned such a move would anger Beijing.

Indonesia survey shows president's approval hit by handling of pandemic,2312,"JAKARTA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo's approval rating has fallen to the lowest level in five years on the back of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections, a survey released on Wednesday showed. Conducted by pollster Indikator Politik Indonesia, the survey showed that 59% of respondents were satisfied with the president, the lowest ranking since March 2016. The survey, which involved 1,220 respondents, was conducted between July 30 to Aug. 4, while the country was in the throes of a virulent virus wave that led to overflowing hospitals and oxygen shortages on the densely populated island of Java. Indonesia has recorded more than 4 million cases of the coronavirus, and over 129,000 deaths, among the highest tallies in Asia. ""While the lower approval rating for Widodo is mainly caused by the pandemic and the government's largely inconsistent and confusing responses to the health crisis, it is unlikely the only factor,"" said Todd Elliot, a senior analyst at Concord Consulting. ""Trust in a government in Indonesia normally decreases if the economy is perceived as underperforming and the latest round of coronavirus curbs have hit businesses particularly hard."" The president said last week in his annual state of the nation speech that there was a need to strike a balance between health and economic interests during the pandemic. read more Overall, 54.3% of respondents surveyed said they trusted the president to properly manage the health crisis, while perceptions of the country’s economic situation were the worst since 2004. The survey indicated widespread dissatisfaction with social restrictions intended to stem the spread of the virus that have been in place since early July. Restrictions were eased on Monday in certain regions, including in Jakarta, to allow for limited capacity at malls, restaurants and places of worship after a recent drop in cases. Only 42% of respondents agreed with the curbs, the survey showed. With more than 50% of Indonesians employed in the informal sector, the curbs have impacted people's livelihoods hard with 79.2% of respondents saying their income had declined during the pandemic, and 53.3% describing their household economic situation as worse, or much worse.

U.N. sees massive drop in COVID vaccinations in Afghanistan after Taliban takeover,2221,"BRUSSELS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - In the first week following the Taliban conquest of Kabul, COVID-19 vaccinations in Afghanistan have dropped by 80%, the U.N. agency UNICEF said, warning that half of the few doses delivered to the country so far are close to expiry. The Taliban seized control of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15, having already captured most of the country earlier in the month after the United States decided to withdraw military forces after 20 years of war. Since the Taliban takeover ""there's been an 80% drop in people reached with COVID-19 vaccines,"" a spokesperson for UNICEF told Reuters. In the week starting on Aug. 15, 30,500 people had been vaccinated in 23 of the 34 provinces of the country, whereas the previous week 134,600 people were inoculated in 30 provinces, according to figures provided by UNICEF, which coordinates the rollout of COVID-19 shots distributed across the world by the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine programme Covax. ""The drop is understandable, as in situations of chaos, conflict and emergency, people will prioritize their safety and security first,"" the UNICEF spokesperson said, noting the U.N. agency has been calling on all Afghan healthcare workers, including women, to return to work. The spokesperson declined to comment about whether the drop in inoculations was also the result of Taliban's possible vaccine scepticism, but warned about risks caused by a protracted slowdown in the vaccination campaign. Nearly 2 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine delivered to Afghanistan, which is about half of the total so far, expire in November, the UNICEF spokesperson said. WHO data show that only 1.2 million doses had been administered as of Aug. 20 in Afghanistan, which has a population of 40 million. Gavi, which co-leads Covax with the WHO, said the programme has so far delivered over 4 million doses to Afghanistan. ""Our priority today is to work with UNICEF and WHO country offices (..) to ensure our ability to continue the country's COVID-19 vaccination programme,"" a Gavi spokesperson told Reuters, declining to comment on whether vaccinations had been hampered by the Taliban.

Analysis: Inflation vs jobs hole: A tradeoff the Fed still hopes to skirt,6201,"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's year-old promise to drive U.S. employment to new heights came at a wrenching moment last August, with 12 million jobs still missing due to the pandemic, inflation cratering to half the central bank's target, and no clear endgame for the worst health crisis in a century. Then came three vaccines, a steady jobs recovery, trillions more dollars in fiscal stimulus, the fastest economic growth in 40 years - and surging prices. A steady shift in Fed rhetoric since inflation jumped in the spring has now triggered debate about how deep the Fed's new commitment to jobs truly runs, and how long it will tolerate high inflation as it waits for a ""broad and inclusive"" rebound in employment. No decisions have been made. The Fed is actively talking about when to reduce its $120 billion per month emergency bond purchases, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell may discuss that in Friday remarks to a virtual iteration of its annual Jackson Hole research conference. The more consequential call over when to raise interest rates from near zero remains, in all likelihood, far down the road. But with each successive report showing inflation above the Fed's 2% target, the tone has shifted. Fed officials now readily acknowledge inflation may be more persistent than they thought. Moreover, some are lowering expectations of a full rebound to the pre-pandemic level of jobs or labor force participation. The debate won't be resolved soon. But the suddenly two-sided nature of the discussion has, to some, cast the value of the Fed's new approach into doubt. ""I think they have lost their nerve,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. In recent comments, ""they have not reinforced their commitment to broad and inclusive gains"" in the labor market. Richard Clarida, the Fed's influential chair, would disagree. At a recent presentation to the Peterson Institute, he said his outlook is for inflation above 2% for three years running, for unemployment so low by the end of 2022 that gains would be broadly felt and jobs returned to the pre-pandemic level, and a rate increase in 2023 ""entirely consistent"" with the Fed's new approach. INFLATION VS JOBS Arguably the last few inflation readings, the latest being almost twice the targeted 2% level, would have been confronted more aggressively by previous Feds. Some feel a tougher approach may be needed now. ""It is getting a little old to say that this is a transitory increase in prices,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon, pointing to surveys showing businesses ready and able to pass through price hikes. ""If firms say they are worried about prices paid and they have pricing power then...we don’t have price stability. The wheels are greased for costs to pass through."" Under the new framework, though, the Fed has pledged not to nip job growth in the bud and, to be certain inflation hits the 2% target on average, will allow it to go above that level ""moderately...for some time."" When the new strategy was rolled out, however, it carried an even deeper sort of pledge. Policymakers have long seen tension between unemployment and inflation. If inflation gets too high, the Fed can tame it through rate increases, albeit it at the cost of higher unemployment. When inflation is weak or unemployment high, it can cut rates and trade more jobs for higher prices. Over 10 years of economic expansion after the 2007-to-2009 recession, that relationship did not hold. As unemployment fell, inflation remained muted, and Fed officials concluded they could exploit that and take more inflation risk to create the type of ""hot"" economy and robust job market that helps the less well-off. Equity is not a goal addressed in the Fed's congressional mandate, but officials have given the issue more attention as the economic costs of inequality have become better appreciated. The quandary arose when the pandemic reanimated what the Fed thought it had escaped: conflict between inflation and jobs. In the thick of the framework debate in 2019 the Fed saw ample jobs and low inflation; now inflation is high, but with 6 million fewer people working than before the pandemic. That has forced an earlier-than-expected reckoning over issues left unresolved in the new strategy. What does ""moderately"" mean when it comes to an inflation overshoot? How fully can the economy recreate the pre-pandemic conditions where, for instance, unemployment hit record lows for African Americans and the share of adults employed or looking for work was climbing steadily? The ""labor force participation rate"" hit 63.4% in January 2020. It's now 61.7%. Black unemployment hit a record low 5.2% in August of 2019, and even then was 1.8 percentage points higher than for whites. As of July it was 8.2%, compared to 4.8% for whites. AN 'AMBITIOUS' GOAL With inflation gnawing, some Fed officials have begun nipping at what to expect from the jobs recovery. Clarida, rather than seeing a full rebound of the labor force participation rate, says it can return to an unspecified ""demographic trend"" dragged lower by the aging population. Where Powell has talked about the plight of displaced workers, he also notes the number of additional people, perhaps 2 million or more, who retired during the pandemic - thus lengthening the time to get back to the pre-pandemic level of jobs, and increasing the likelihood the Fed may raise interest rates before that happens. Much depends on inflation. If it proves the product of global supply shocks and reopening, and recedes on its own, the potential tradeoff with the job market eases. If not, then the Fed's priorities will be tested in ways not envisioned when the new strategy was approved. ""They set a very ambitious goal. This is year one...We don't know if it's successful for at least a couple of years,"" said Edward Al-Hussainy, senior rates and currency analyst for Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""The first priority is still the recovery in the labor market...People are starting to lose focus on that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Thailand urges pregnant women to get vaccinated, cites higher risks",1740,"BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Thailand's coronavirus task force on Wednesday called on pregnant women in the country to get vaccinated against COVID-19, citing a higher risk of deaths among those who become infected with the coronavirus. ""We have a target of vaccinating 500,000 women who are at least 12 weeks pregnant, but only 2,078, or 0.4%, have received two doses,"" Apisamai Srirangsan, a spokesperson for the coronavirus task force, told a news briefing. ""Pregnant women are 2.5 times more likely to die after an infection than others due to changes to body shape that makes breathing more difficult,"" said Apisamai. Thailand has fully vaccinated about 9.7% of its overall population of over 66 million with a combination of China’s Sinovac (SVA.O) vaccine and AstraZeneca shots (AZN.L). The Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) vaccine is being offered to pregnant women and as a booster to medical workers who had previously received two shots of Sinovac. Health ministry data showed since April 2,327 pregnant women had been infected, of which 22 had received one vaccine dose. So far, 53 women and 23 unborn babies had died, the data showed. A study by British scientists in April showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 faced higher risks than previously known such as premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care and possible death. Women who are at least three months pregnant can safely get inoculated with any vaccine, Apisamai said, adding that immunity could also be transferred to the child. Thailand has reported 1.1 million cases of the coronavirus and over 10,000 fatalities, the majority of which occurred after April. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Vietnam to pay recovered COVID-19 patients to help in hospitals,1988,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam is offering patients who have recovered from the coronavirus a monthly allowance if they agree to stay on at stretched hospitals to help health workers struggling to cope with an influx of infected people. After successfully containing COVID-19 for much of the pandemic, Vietnam is facing its worst outbreak to date driven by the virulent Delta variant, with a surge in cases and deaths ramping up pressure on health authorities. The plan to bring in recovered patients was launched this week in Ho Chi Minh City, which is the epicentre of the current outbreak, accounting for half of the country's nearly 185,000 infections and 7,302 deaths, or about 80% of total fatalities. Working alongside health workers, the role of the former patients in the programme, called ""patient zero with patient zero"", is to support public healthcare services. ""Participants will be provided with personal protective equipment, food, accommodation and a monthly allowance of 8 million dong ($350.80),"" according to a letter reviewed by Reuters that was sent from the head of a hospital taking part of the scheme to recovered COVID-19 patients. The field hospital No.8 treated at least 10,000 patients in July. In recent weeks, Vietnam's health ministry has dispatched 14,600 additional doctors and nurses to the city and its neighbouring provinces to support an overwhelmed medical system. read more ""I don't care much about the allowance, I just want to help burned out healthcare workers,"" Nguyen Hoang Anh, who recovered from the virus a few weeks ago, said by telephone. ""I believe my presence at the hospital will give strength to patients who are battling against the virus,"" said Anh, who has applied to become a participant. Hit by the Delta variant, the Southeast Asian country reported a record 10,811 infections on Tuesday, up more than ten-fold on daily levels at the start of July.

Vietnam urges WHO to send more COVID-19 shots as cases surge despite lockdown,3229,"SINGAPORE/HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - While the rapid spread of the Delta variant and low vaccinations have caught much of Asia off-guard, no country shows more vividly than Vietnam how easily the highly infectious version of the coronavirus can foil strict containment policy. Vietnam had successfully contained the coronavirus for most of last year but since April has been dealing with a large COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta. Nearly all of its 370,000 COVID-19 cases have been detected since May and daily infections jumped above 10,000 for the first time this month, overloading hospitals in southern part of the country and raising case fatality rates. ""It is a very good example of a country left behind when all the wealthier countries of the world grabbed the vaccines first,"" said Dale Fisher, a senior infectious disease expert at the National University Hospital in Singapore. ""This disadvantage will only be exacerbated as those same countries engage a precautionary third dose, while countries like Vietnam struggle in single-digit vaccine rates."" Vietnam has fully inoculated just 2% of its 98 million people, among the lowest in Asia, as it opted for containment policy and did not rush to procure vaccines, which it deemed financially too risky due to a severe global shortage. ""If the vaccination rate remains too low not only could Vietnam overtake Indonesia (as the next epicentre) but also be at risk of selecting another variant which is more likely in the unvaccinated population,"" said Roger Lord, a senior medical sciences lecturer at Australian Catholic University. As the Delta variant has upended all assumptions about the virus, Vietnam, a key part of global supply chain for such brands as Samsung (005930.KS) and Nike (NKE.N), is now scrambling to secure more vaccines. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh sent a letter to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday and urged its vaccine sharing programme COVAX to prioritize Vietnam ""in the fastest manner and with the largest volume possible."" Its slow vaccination drive was also impacted by Vietnam's procurement plan, contrasting with many of its neighbours which heavily relied on China for supplies due to limited access to Western shots. Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, has received just around 2.7 million vaccines from China. By contrast, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia, have managed to keep vaccination rates higher by relying on supplies from Beijing. read more At a meeting with Chinh on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador said it would donate 2 million more doses of its vaccines, just a day before the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan to offer 1 million doses of Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech vaccines. read more Amid slow delivery of vaccines, Vietnam has introduced lockdowns and mobilised troops to restrict movements in Ho Chi Minh City, an elimination strategy also adopted by Australia with limited success so far. read more ""When case numbers become very high and presumably due to the Delta variant they (stringent lockdowns) become significantly less effective and make contract tracing very difficult,"" Lord said.

India hurries teacher vaccinations as some physical classes resume,2017,"NEW DELHI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - India will supply millions of additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to its states to try to inoculate all school teachers by early next month, the health minister said on Wednesday, as the country gradually resumes physical classes. The pandemic has hit the country of 1.35 billion people particularly hard and hundreds of millions of its students have been stuck at home for months, with little or no access to online education for a majority of the poor. India last week approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for older children and is trying to urgently immunise all of its nearly 10 million school teachers. The country has been vaccinating its adults since the middle of January. ""We have requested all states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers' Day, which is celebrated on Sept. 5,"" Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Twitter. He said states would be given more than 20 million additional doses for the purpose. Several states have attempted to reopen schools since the pandemic began last year, but some had to shut them down when infections were detected on campuses. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat said it would resume physical classes for middle school students from Sept. 2, at half the capacity, for the first time in more than 18 months. Schools reopened for older children nearly a month ago. A parliamentary report said this month the pandemic disrupted the education of nearly 320 million Indian students in various schools, colleges and universities. It recommended ""accentuated vaccine programmes for all students, teachers and allied staff so that schools may start functioning normally at the earliest"". India has administered 596 million vaccine doses, giving at least one dose to nearly half of its 944 million adults and the required two doses to 14%. It has reported 32.5 million infections, the most in the world after the United States, and 435,758 deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
New Zealand pushes ahead with vaccinations as Delta outbreak widens,1789,"WELLINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - New Zealand recorded 62 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of infections in the latest outbreak to 210 as the government scrambled to scale up vaccinations amid growing criticism. Most of the cases are in the largest city Auckland, while 12 are in the capital Wellington, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference. He said 20,383 individual contacts have been identified in the outbreak and there are now over 480 locations of interest. Fortress New Zealand's virus-free run since February ended last week after an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland and quickly spread to Wellington. The outbreak prompted prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a strict level 4 national lockdown. Ardern's reliance on strict border controls and snap lockdowns to eliminate the virus has been called into question amid the latest outbreak, which has occurred while few people have been vaccinated. About 80% of the population has yet to be fully vaccinated. The government said a record 80,000 people were vaccinated on Wednesday and 50,000 others tested. The government defended its elimination strategy, saying it was still the best option for New Zealand. ""It's too soon to throw in the towel. We’ve come this far – it would be an absolute waste for us to give up on this now,"" COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said at a news conference. ""You will see changes in the medium term and in the way we manage the border. We do want to get to the point where lockdowns are not the answer to potential outbreaks in the community. But we are not there yet.” New Zealand has had over 2,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far and 26 related deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Taiwan reports no new domestic COVID-19 cases, first time since May 9",1425,"TAIPEI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan reported zero new domestic COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the first time since May 9 it has logged no community transmissions, with the pandemic on the democratically ruled island now well under control. The number of COVD-19 cases in Taiwan began climbing in mid-May after months of no or few domestic infections, prompting the government to impose curbs on gatherings, close entertainment venues and stop in-restaurant dining. With the success of those restrictions, as well as ramped up testing and widespread compliance with the rules including mask wearing, those curbs were eased last month. read more Border controls and quarantines for all arrivals have been strengthened. While Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said he was happy to see no new domestic cases, people should not rest on their laurels and let down their guard. ""These two weeks are a very important observation period. I hope it can be maintained. Everyone, please don't let up,"" he told reporters. Taiwan's success stands in stark contrast to many of it neighbours, including Vietnam and Japan, where the virus continues to spread rapidly. Taiwan's domestic outbreak was almost exclusively the previously globally dominant Alpha variant, rather than the highly contagious Delta variant. Taiwan has reported 15,939 cases since the pandemic began, including 830 deaths. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. VP Harris offers Vietnam support to counter Beijing in the South China Sea,4589,"HANOI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met Vietnam's top leaders on Wednesday, offering support in several key areas including the enhancement of its maritime security in an effort to counter Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Harris also offered more visits by U.S. warships during her talks with Vietnam's President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, according to a White House official who did not wish to be named. Harris's seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam is part of a broader U.S. strategy to woo allies that Washington hopes will help it challenge China's growing security and economic influence in the region. During the talks Harris offered Vietnam vaccines and aid to tackle COVID-19 and announced the launch of several programs to help combat climate change, said the White House official. Speaking in Hanoi, Harris said there was a need to increase pressure on Beijing over its maritime claims. ""We need to find ways to pressure, raise the pressure…on Beijing to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to challenge, its bullying and excessive maritime claims,"" said Harris during a meeting with the Vietnamese president. It was the second time in two days Harris has attacked Beijing. On Tuesday in Singapore, Harris accused Beijing of coercion and intimidation to back unlawful claims in parts of the disputed the South China Sea. China rejected her comments, charging Washington with trying to drive a wedge between Beijing and its Southeast Asian neighbors. read more China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea, which is crossed by vital shipping lanes and contain gas fields and rich fishing grounds. China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan lay claim to parts of the waters. Over the last few years, tensions between China and Vietnam in the South China Sea have remained high and Vietnam has quietly endorsed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy because it takes a hard line against China in the disputed waters. However, with U.S.-China competition throughout the Indo-Pacific dramatically heating up, the Southeast Asian nation has attempted to strike a delicate balancing act. Harris' arrival in Hanoi was delayed on Tuesday after the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam said it had detected an ""anomalous health incident"", potentially related to the mysterious Havana Syndrome. read more During the delay, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China's ambassador to Vietnam held a previously unannounced meeting, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not take sides in foreign policy. The Chinese ambassador told Chinh Beijing would donate 2 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to Vietnam. Senior White House officials have said Harris will strike a balance during her meetings in the region by offering to counter China's influence while not forcing the nations to take sides between the two powers. The U.S. vice president announced support for Vietnam's response to COVID-19 with the donation of an additional one million doses of Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccines, bringing the total donation to the country to 6 million doses, and an additional $23 million to support its efforts to fight the pandemic. After successfully containing the pandemic for much of last year, Vietnam has since April been dealing with a large outbreak of the Delta variant of the virus in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Asia, with just under 2% of its 98 million people fully-vaccinated against COVID-19. MARITIME SECURITY CO-OPERATION The vice president's offer to support Vietnam's increased maritime security included visits by U.S. ships and aircraft carriers, the White House official said. Also contingent on approval from the U.S. Congress, she offered the deployment of a third U.S. Coast Guard high-endurance cutter - a fleet of 24 patrol boats, base facilities, piers, law enforcement training, and other joint activities that helps Vietnam bolster its maritime security, the official said. The U.S. also launched a five-year, $36 million USAID project which aims to accelerate Vietnam's transition to clean energy and announced lower tariffs on U.S. exports of corn, wheat, and pork products to Vietnam to reduce the trade deficit with the country. Harris is also expected to sign a lease for a new U.S. Embassy compound in Hanoi in an effort to expand the relationship between the two countries, the official said.

Financially isolating Afghanistan is pointless,3883,"MUMBAI, Aug 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A fresh disaster can be averted in Afghanistan, but the international community needs to act fast.

Few countries are as reliant on international funding; about half of the roughly $6 billion budget for 2021 was expected to be financed by grants and borrowings led by foreign agencies, per the World Bank.

9th Circuit orders do-over in ADA case against college system,4190,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Defusing a potential landmine it planted last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday held that individuals with disabilities can sue over practices that have a discriminatory effect on them even if no discrimination was intended. In a 2-1 split, the panel rejected Los Angeles Community College District’s argument that the Americans with Disabilities Act and its predecessor, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, did not authorize private lawsuits for disparate-impact claims by two former students, the National Federation of the Blind and its California affiliate. Although the panel unanimously overturned the judgment on other grounds and remanded the case for further proceedings, “we consider this a win, for all people with disabilities,” said Joseph Espo of Brown, Goldstein & Levy, which represented plaintiffs Roy Payan, Portia Mason, and the organizations. “The court clearly ruled that there is a private right of action for disparate-impact claims under Title II (of the ADA) and Section 504,” Espo said. The 9th Circuit has long recognized that right, but questioned it last year in an unrelated case – citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision interpreting the 1964 Civil Rights Act – and ordered both LACCD and the plaintiffs to brief the issue. LACCD’s attorney, David Urban of Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, said in an email that they are “evaluating the decision, pleased the Ninth Circuit accepted arguments that LACCD presented, and planning next steps.” The district is “committed to making resources at Los Angeles City College available to blind students,” Urban added. Payan and Mason attended City College, an LACCD school, in 2015 and 2016, and filed suit in 2017 in federal court in Los Angeles. They alleged that LACCD violated federal law and its own policies in numerous ways, such as failing to provide them with accessible assignments and course materials, maintaining an inaccessible website, and purchasing library materials that their screen-reading programs could not access. They included claims for failure to reasonably accommodate their disabilities as well as disparate-impact claims. U.S. District Judge Steven Wilson dismissed the former but ruled that LACCD was liable on the latter. After a 2019 jury trial on damages, Wilson awarded Payan $40,000 and ordered LACCD to remediate its website, evaluate educational technology for accessibility prior to procurement, make its library databases accessible, and designate a Dean of Educational Technology with responsibility for enforcing accessibility policies. On Tuesday, Circuit Judge Richard Tallman said Wilson erred in dismissing the individual accommodation claims and in treating the allegations solely as disparate-impact claims that required systemwide relief. He was joined by Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, dissenting, said ADA Title II and the Rehabilitation Act authorize private suits only for intentional discrimination. In a footnote, the majority mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed last month to consider whether Section 504, as incorporated by the Affordable Care Act, allows ERISA plan participants to bring disparate-impact disability discrimination claims. (Espo and Urban declined to comment on that case, CVS Pharmacy v. Doe.) In a separate nonprecedential memorandum, the 9th Circuit added that Wilson had made evidentiary, procedural, and substantive errors that had harmed both sides, and that the scope of injunctive relief was too broad. The case is Payan et al. v. Los Angeles Community College District, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 19-56111.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Morrison & Foerster on Tuesday became the latest law firm to bulk up its life sciences and healthcare team, adding Palo Alto-based partner Hogene Choi to its patent strategy and prosecution group. Choi, who has a computer science background and experience in data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, leaves Baker Botts, where she served as co-chair of the patent counseling and strategic portfolio development practice group. She works with life sciences, healthcare and technology industry clients, according to the firm. Firms have been scooping up lawyers with life sciences and healthcare experience over the past 18 months in response to increased demand from clients in a variety of practice areas, including for corporate transactions, technology, regulatory and intellectual property expertise. Several other firms in the past year have made moves to hire IP lawyers with life sciences industry experience, including Cooley, White & Case, Barnes & Thornburg and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. San Francisco-founded Morrison & Foerster recently hired other life sciences and technology lawyers, including Stacy Cline Amin, former chief counsel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who joined as a partner and co-lead of the firm's FDA regulatory and compliance practice in June. The firm lost a life sciences dealmaker in July to Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. Michael Ward, head of the firm's life sciences and healthcare and patent practices, in a statement described Choi's computer science, patent prosecution, litigation and technology expertise as ""tremendous assets"" that ""align perfectly with the areas where we are seeing extraordinary client demand across our global offices."" Choi said in an interview on Tuesday that she was drawn to the firm because of its life sciences platform and its ""well-known culture of collaboration."" She also noted that she previously worked with Mark Whitaker, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's IP litigation group. Whitaker joined the firm from Baker Botts in 2016. Many life sciences companies have software-related needs, including using AI and machine learning to speed up research and development efforts, and using ""basic software"" in medical devices to improve benefits to patients, Choi said. The use of technology is an ""exploding area of the industry,"" she said. Prior to joining Baker Botts in 2011, Choi practiced at Kilpatrick Townsend, the Lanier Law Firm and Fish & Richardson as an associate, according to her LinkedIn page. A Baker Botts representative said the firm wishes her well in the new role.

Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies after tour pull out,5601,"LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, widely regarded as one of the coolest men in rock, a jazz enthusiast and a snappy dresser, died on Tuesday just three weeks after pulling out of the band's upcoming U.S. tour for health reasons. He was 80 years old. ""It is with immense sadness that we announce the death of our beloved Charlie Watts. He passed away peacefully in a London hospital earlier today surrounded by his family,"" Watts' spokesperson said in a statement. Among the first British bands to properly crack the American market and a symbol of 1960s London, the Rolling Stones lineup of Watts, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones and Bill Wyman produced a string of hit records. The Stones also went on to break records with multimillion-pound grossing global tours. Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr described Watts as a ""beautiful human being"" and said he was shocked by Watts' death. ""I knew he wasn't doing well, but it was a shock to me,"" Starr, who joined the Beatles in August 1962, five months before Watts became a member of the Rolling Stones, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview after Watts' death. Watts played drums on all of the group's 30 albums and on every tour. No cause of death was given for his passing, but the announcement followed an Aug. 4 statement by the band that the drummer was pulling out of its rescheduled No Filter U.S. tour because he needed time to recuperate after an unspecified emergency medical procedure. Bandmates had expected Watts to rejoin the band. ""We really look forward to welcoming Charlie back as soon as he is fully recovered,"" Jagger tweeted on Aug. 4. After the death of Watts was announced, Jagger tweeted an image of the joyful drummer while Keith Richards posted a photo of a drum set without adding any words. Disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the No Filter tour is scheduled to kick off on Sept. 26 in St. Louis. There was no word on Tuesday whether it would go ahead. The death of Watts brought tributes from musicians ranging from Paul McCartney to country singer Rosanne Cash. ""Charlie Watts was the ultimate drummer,"" Elton John posted on Twitter. ""The most stylish of men, and such brilliant company. McCartney sent condolences in a video message. ""I knew he was ill but I didn't know he was this ill... It's a huge blow to them because Charlie was a rock and a fantastic drummer."" Watts was born in 1941 during World War Two and grew up in the Wembley area of northwest London, attending Harrow school of Art before starting work as a graphic artist with an advertising agency.

REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File Photo Unlike his bandmates, Watts had been in a successful group before agreeing to join the Rolling Stones in 1963. He married Shirley Ann Shepherd in 1964 and they remained together until his death - the first regular member of the band to pass away since Jones in 1969. While holding down the day job, Watts played in the evenings with Blues Incorporated led by Alexis Korner, alongside future Cream bassist Jack Bruce. He was replaced by future Cream drummer Ginger Baker when he left. He played his first gig with the Stones at the Ealing Blues Club in West London with the six piece band that included pianist Ian Stewart, Wyman on bass and Jones on guitar. Watts left the hell-raising that defined the Stones in the 1960s and '70s to the other members, but provided the heartbeat of the band, and with Wyman was considered one of the great rock rhythm sections. Away from the Rolling Stones, Watts found the time to play jazz with several groups including a 32-piece band, the Charlie Watts Orchestra, as well as to work with pianist Stewart in the band Rocket 88 during the 1980s. In the 1990s, the Charlie Watts Quintet released several albums, including a tribute to jazz great Charlie Parker. In 2004, the quintet expanded to become Charlie Watts and the Tentet. 'DIDN'T SUIT ME AT ALL' While his bandmates entertained groupies on an epic scale, Watts indulged instead - he once told a radio interviewer - in a compulsive habit of sketching every new hotel room he occupied. He did speak of a short period in the 1980s when he tried to deal with a mid-life crisis by bingeing on drink and drugs. ""It was very short for me. I just stopped, it didn’t suit me at all,"" he told the Daily Mirror newspaper in 2012. ""I drank too much and took drugs. I went mad really. But I stopped it all. It was very easy for me."" In 2004, he was diagnosed with throat cancer after having quit smoking in the late 1980s, and underwent radiation therapy. The cancer went into remission, and he returned to recording and touring with the Stones. Despite newspaper accounts of a drunken spat with Jagger in the 1980s over whether the singer or the drummer was more important to a group, Watts was in a magnanimous mood when he spoke to the Guardian newspaper in 2013. ""Mick is the show, really, we back him,"" he said, adding however, ""but Mick wouldn’t dance well if the sound was bad."" Watts was always known as a keen shopper and a snappy dresser. The Daily Telegraph once named him one of the World's Best Dressed Men and in 2006 Vanity Fair inducted him into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. ""It's supposed to be sex and drugs and rock and roll,"" he once said. ""I'm not really like that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Goldman Sachs to mandate COVID vaccine for staff, visitors at U.S. offices -memo",1757,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) told employees that from Tuesday anyone entering its offices in the United States must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The bank will also require that masks be worn in offices regardless of vaccination status from Wednesday, while fully vaccinated employees will receive weekly COVID-19 tests starting on Sept. 7, the memo said. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. The announcement comes a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, a certification that public health officials hope will convince unvaccinated Americans that the shot is safe and effective. read more In June, Goldman was one of the earliest Wall Street banks to require that most employees return to offices, and the vaccine mandate is part of the effort to continue working at offices safely amid a resurgence in COVID cases. Goldman's new policy is in line with rival banks Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), which also require vaccines at their U.S. headquarters. Three of the four largest U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) - do not require vaccines for individuals at their offices. Bank of America has asked that only vaccinated employees come into its offices when it begins formally welcoming people back in September. COVID-19 infections are increasing in the United States at an average of about 150,000 cases a day, and are currently at 60% of the peak level of new daily infections reported in January, according to Reuters tracking data.

U.S. could control COVID by spring 2022 if more people get shots -Fauci,3732,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The United States could get COVID-19 under control by early next year if vaccinations ramp up, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday, one day after Pfizer (PFE.N) won fuller FDA approval for its shot, with more potential approvals coming in the weeks ahead. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in multiple television interviews and a White House press conference that full Food and Drug Administration approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine paves the way for more people to get inoculated, with potential approval for Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) in the coming weeks and authorization for younger children by autumn. ""I would like to appeal to the people in the country who are not vaccinated to realize that we have the capability, among ourselves, to essentially cut down the time frame to getting to the end of this pandemic,"" Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a Tuesday press conference. ""I think there's a reasonable chance"" that Pfizer or Moderna could get FDA clearance for children under 12 before the upcoming holiday season, he told NBC News. ""Hopefully by the mid-late fall and early winter."" U.S. officials during the Tuesday press briefing also urged private employers and more state and local governments to require staff to get vaccinated in a bid to drive up vaccination rates. ""Now is the time"" for U.S. employers to start mandating vaccinations, White House COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zients said, echoing remarks from President Joe Biden on Monday. Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci responds to accusations by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as he testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Capitol hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 20, 2021. J. Scott Applewhite/Pool via REUTERS Meanwhile, the White House is preparing to provide third ""booster"" doses starting in mid-September to Americans who received their COVID-19 inoculation more than eight months ago. The plan depends upon a thumbs up from the FDA and an advisory panel to the CDC. read more ""We want to make sure we stay ahead of the virus,"" Zients said, adding that ""the plan is pending the FDA conducting an independent evaluation and outside experts... issuing a booster dose recommendation."" Fauci added that healthcare providers should also make more use of COVID-19 antibody treatments, including those from Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O), and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L)/Vir Biotechnology Inc (VIR.O). Such treatments can reduce hospitalizations and deaths by as much as 85% if used early in infected people, he said. The United States is battling another wave of cases due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, particularly in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and other parts of the U.S. South. The average number of deaths from COVID-19 has risen by 23% over the previous seven-day period, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during a Tuesday press call. The United States is now averaging 1,000 COVID deaths a day and over 150,000 new cases, according to a Reuters tally. U.S. health officials have also noted the number of inoculations has also risen in recent weeks and say they hope Monday's FDA action spurs more people get their first shots. The U.S. military, along with several businesses and universities, including CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), privately held Deloitte and at least one college football team, have moved ahead with COVID vaccine mandates since the FDA's announcement, which also buoyed Wall Street.

Judge 'struggling' with talc plaintiffs' bid to block J&J asset maneuvering,4730,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Delaware bankruptcy judge said on Tuesday that she was uncertain about a bid by individuals with talc-related personal injury claims to block Johnson & Johnson from taking steps that they believe could shift valuable assets out of their reach. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein in Wilmington, Delaware made her comments during a virtual hearing over a group of talc claimants’ motion in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of J&J's former talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, to enjoin J&J from pursuing a transaction that would separate its talc-related liabilities from its assets. The individuals seeking the injunction hold personal injury claims against Imerys, which is pursuing a reorganization plan that would set up a trust to compensate personal injury claimants and is seeking indemnification from J&J to fund the trust. J&J’s alleged indemnification obligations, which it disputes, stem from a series of supply agreements between the two companies. J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging baby powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe. Imerys was named as a co-defendant in many talc-related lawsuits and ultimately filed for bankruptcy to address the litigation in 2019. Reuters reported in July that J&J is considering a plan to separate liabilities from talc-related litigation into a newly-created entity that would then be placed in bankruptcy. The healthcare conglomerate could do so under the Texas “divisive merger” law that allows a company to split into more than one entity. J&J has neither confirmed nor denied whether it intends to pursue the divisive merger. A lawyer for the talc claimants, Natalie Ramsey of Robinson & Cole, argued that the transaction, if it were to occur, would violate the automatic stay protecting entities in bankruptcy against efforts to collect on debts owed or seize the debtors’ assets. Silverstein said she was “struggling” with the situation and would need a few days to issue a ruling. “I’m having some trouble wrapping my head around this as [an automatic stay] violation as opposed to perhaps something else,” the judge said. Ramsey told the judge that Imerys’s right to indemnification under its contract with J&J is a property right. An effort to separate J&J’s talc liabilities from its valuable assets and place the entity with the talc-liabilities into bankruptcy would impair its ability to satisfy those indemnification obligations, and thereby impair Imerys’s property rights, she said. “It would be like taking the debtors’ sports car and bringing back a beat-up jalopy,” she said. Ramsey argued that such a transaction would be a “targeted act” aimed at controlling Imerys property and therefore constitute a violation of the automatic stay. She urged the judge to reject J&J’s contention that barring it from moving forward with a divisive merger would interfere with its normal corporate operations. Theodore Tsekerides of Weil Gotshal & Manges, representing J&J, said the plaintiffs are trying to enjoin the company from using legal restructuring tools. The plaintiffs haven’t shown that this type of transaction by J&J would cause harm, he added. “Charitably, the motion is a hot mess,” he said. Separately, a group of cancer victims filed papers in a Missouri state court on Tuesday aiming to block J&J from placing its talc-related liabilities into bankruptcy. The case is In re Imerys Talc America, Inc., U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 19-10289.

Explainer: What happens after Biden's evacuation force leaves Afghanistan?,4718,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday stuck by his plan to remove the nearly 6,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of August, contingent on whether the Taliban cooperates to allow the evacuation of more Americans and their Afghan allies. read more Biden announced a plan in April to withdraw 2,500 U.S. troops who were still in Afghanistan after a 20-year war, but was forced to send thousands more back to evacuate those at risk as the U.S.-backed government and military quickly collapsed. The chaotic and perilous evacuation from Kabul airport that ensued has unleashed a wave of criticism and presented Biden with his biggest crisis since taking office in January. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? U.S. officials say the troop withdrawal must begin no later than Friday to be completed by Aug. 31 and it will take several days. The troops at Kabul airport include Marines and paratroopers. As they pack up their equipment and withdraw, the pace of evacuations by U.S. and allied forces - which reached 20,000 a day this week - will inevitably slow. HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN BE EVACUATED BY THE DEADLINE? Since Aug. 14, more than 70,000 people, including American citizens, NATO personnel and Afghans at risk, have been evacuated from Kabul, Biden said on Tuesday. Biden has said the United States will evacuate any U.S. citizen who wants to leave and officials have said they will evacuate as many at-risk Afghans as possible. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Pentagon believes it has the ability to get all Americans who want to leave out by Aug. 31 and U.S. officials say 4,000 Americans have been evacuated so far, but they do not know how many are still in the country, as not all registered with the U.S. embassy. The Pentagon has also committed to evacuate the roughly 500 Afghan soldiers who have been helping to protect Kabul airport. Despite the current pace of evacuation, which has involved dozens of military transport planes from the United States and around the world, many thousands of Afghans who officials and advocacy groups say face potential retribution at the hands of the Taliban, will not be able to leave by Biden's deadline. WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND? The Association of Wartime Allies, a refugee resettlement group, estimates 250,000 Afghans, including interpreters and drivers and other workers who helped the U.S. effort, need to be evacuated, but only 62,000 have left since July. The State Department says the aim is to help at-risk Afghans leave even after the troop withdrawal and that Washington will put pressure on the Taliban to ensure they are able to do so. ""What does not end when the military mission ends is our commitment to at-risk Afghans,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We will hold the Taliban to this; the rest of the world will as well – that individuals who seek to leave after the U.S. military is gone will have an opportunity to do so."" WHAT LEVERAGE DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE? One of the biggest questions the Biden administration and like-minded governments face is whether to recognize the government the Taliban establishes. This would have important consequences, including as to whether the Taliban will have access to the foreign aid relied upon by previous Afghan governments. A 2020 agreement signed by the former Trump administration explicitly states that the Taliban ""is not recognized by the United States as a state,"" but there are already signs Washington will have to talk to the Islamist militant group on some issues, such as counter-terrorism. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday in the highest level official encounter since the group took over Kabul on Aug. 15. U.S. officials say the Taliban opposes groups like Islamic State and U.S. diplomats and commanders have been in contact with Taliban officials throughout the evacuation. WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS? The United States, its allies and the United Nations will have to decide how to deal with a looming humanitarian disaster. The U.N. says more than 18 million people - over half Afghanistan's population - require aid and half of all Afghan children under the age of five already suffer from acute malnutrition amid the second drought in four years. The World Health Organization says it has only enough supplies in Afghanistan to last a week after deliveries were blocked by restrictions at Kabul airport and it is concerned the upheaval will push up coronavirus infections. The Taliban have assured the U.N. it can pursue humanitarian work, but the world body will insist on women's rights and access to all civilians. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"U.S. COVID-19 vaccine approval is 'seismic' shift for legality of mandates, experts say",3753,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Formal U.S approval of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine will make it nearly impossible to successfully challenge mandates by employers, legal experts said. The decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give full approval to the vaccine is ""seismic,"" said Brian Dean Abramson, an author on vaccine law. He said it will become extremely difficult to challenge the FDA's decision and the mandates that flow from it. On Monday, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine became the first to secure full FDA validation, prompting calls for governments and private employers to make the shots mandatory. COVID-19 vaccines have been available in the United States since December under the an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA. Language in the EUA law states that recipients must be informed of benefits and risks of the vaccine and given the option to accept or refuse it. That language raised some uncertainty regarding employer mandates, which are usually considered legal, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings Law. ""With full approval, that is removed."" Following the FDA announcement on Monday, CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) - the second-largest U.S. oil producer - and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) issued mandates for some employees. Legal experts said there already was a growing consensus that employers could mandate an emergency vaccine. During the pandemic, both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice issued guidance in support of vaccine mandates, provided exceptions were made for medical conditions and religious beliefs. But emergency vaccine requirements have not gone unchallenged. At least a dozen lawsuits have been filed, mostly by students against colleges, but also by employees fighting allegations of wrongful termination for refusing a shot. Most of the cases prominently feature arguments that vaccines approved on an emergency basis could not be required, seizing on language in the emergency authorization law that requires consent from the vaccine recipient. Isaac Legaretta, for example, said he was never told he could refuse the vaccine required by the Dona Ana Detention Center in New Mexico where he worked. ""Quite the opposite, he was advised that he would be fired if he did so,"" said the Legaretta lawsuit, which was filed in February and is pending. In July, in one of the few rulings involving a private employer, a federal judge in Texas upheld vaccine mandates for employees at a Houston Methodist Hospital, finding the employees misunderstood the language in the EUA law. Legal experts said challenges to vaccine mandates will almost certainly persist, particularly against public employers or public universities and colleges, which involve allegations of governments infringing on an individual's Constitutional rights. That argument does not apply to private employers. But as long as the government is requiring the vaccine as a condition of employment or education, legal experts said those will be difficult cases to make. ""You can always go work for somebody else or go to a school that doesn't require a vaccine,"" said Jeffrey Nolan, an attorney with Holland & Knight, which represents employers. Many employers have tried to use incentives such as gift cards and time off to encourage vaccinations. That approach seems to have run its course, legal experts said. With full FDA approval, employers appear ready to move toward ordering staff to get vaccinated. Samantha Monsees, an attorney with Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said: ""I think based on my workload in the last two days the FDA approval is going to tip the scales with a lot of employers.""

"Meme stocks soar in late day trading surge, short sellers knocked",2532,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Shares of several retail trading darlings, including AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) and GameStop (GME.N), surged in heavy volume late on Tuesday, on no apparent news, dealing over $1 billion in losses to short sellers. While broad market indexes rose modestly on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq (.IXIC) up 0.5% and the S&P 500 (.SPX) 0.1% higher, several of the ""meme stocks"" notched big gains. GameStop shares jumped 27.53%, AMC shares climbed 20.3%, Clover Health Investments (CLOV.O) rose 9.9%, Koss Corp (KOSS.O) rose 4.4%, Robinhood Markets climbed (HOOD.O) 9.0% and ContextLogic (WISH.O) rose 6.4%. ""When you get a move that big it almost makes you think there is some big hedge fund or something out there that decided to do some trades,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research. Frederick, however, said he had seen little in the way of news to spur the large share price moves on Tuesday. The jump in the share price on Tuesday also dealt large losses to investors with bearish bets on some of these stocks, according to analytics company ORTEX. ""Heavily shorted stocks have, for the last month, been less volatile than earlier this year. Today we saw an end to this,"" said Ortex co-founder Peter Hillerberg. The share price gains in AMC and GameStop generated losses for close to $1 billion for short sellers, Hillerberg said. Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. Several of these stocks also drew higher-than-usual trading volume in the options market on Tuesday, as traders jockeyed to either take advantage of the rallying prices or moved to cover positions that were under water. For instance, GameStop options trading volume was at 407,000 contracts, or about six times its recent average daily trading volume, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. AMC options volume came in at 1.6 million contracts, nearly three times its daily average, making it the most active single stock name in the options market on Tuesday, Trade Alert data showed. While the retail trading frenzy that had taken Wall Street by storm earlier this year has subsided somewhat in recent months, the periodic wild moves in the share prices has kept investors on their toes, analysts said. ""Options prices are implying that this is not going away any time soon,"" said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Diabetes surges among American youth, study shows",2953,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The number of young people with the most prevalent form of diabetes nearly doubled in the United States from 2001 to 2017, according to a study published on Tuesday. The findings showed that the rate of young people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes increased by 95% over the 16-year period. The estimated rate of youth under age 20 with type 1 diabetes grew by 45%. ""Rising rates of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, which is preventable, has the potential to create a cascade of poor health outcomes,"" said Dr Giuseppina Imperatore, who oversees disease surveillance and other areas at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Diabetes Translation. This month, Reuters published a special report on the worsening outcomes for people with diabetes in the United States. The new findings come from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, which was funded by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). One in 10 Americans, or 34 million people, have diabetes in the United States. About 1.6 million people have type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease of unknown cause that requires insulin injections when the pancreas stops producing the hormone. Millions more have type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition in which the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use it well. Researchers found significant increases in diabetes among both sexes and across racial and ethnic groups. Type 1 diabetes remains more common among white youth. Larger increases in type 2 prevalence were found among young people who are Black or Hispanic, according to the study published in JAMA. The highest rates of type 2 diabetes were seen in youth who are Black or Native American. Jean M. Lawrence, the paper's lead author and director of the NIH's diabetes epidemiology program, said more research is needed to better understand what's driving these increases. ""Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes could be caused by rising rates of childhood obesity, in-utero exposure to maternal obesity and diabetes, or increased diabetes screenings,"" Lawrence said. The COVID-19 pandemic also hit people with diabetes particularly hard, including those who never got sick from the virus but fell victim to the isolation and disruption it caused. Reuters in the Special Report found that deaths from diabetes last year surged 17% to more than 100,000. Younger people, those ages 25 to 44, suffered the sharpest increase, with a 29% jump in deaths. By comparison, all other deaths except those directly attributed to the coronavirus rose 6% last year, Reuters found.

"NRA gun lobby cancels annual U.S. meeting, citing COVID-19 surge",2412,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association (NRA) said on Tuesday it has canceled its upcoming annual convention, which was set to open late next week in Houston, citing public health concerns posed by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. The announcement came amid court action brought by New York state Attorney General Letitia James seeking to dissolve the NRA, accusing the nation's leading firearms lobby of failing to root out rampant internal corruption. read more The NRA's yearly Meeting & Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the country, primarily members of the gun rights organization, to several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms displays. The 2021 event had been scheduled to run from Sept. 3 through Sept. 5 at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. But the beleaguered organization said in a statement it had decided to indefinitely postpone the annual meeting ""after analyzing relevant data regarding COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas,"" which encompasses the city of Houston. Texas, like much of the United States, has seen COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths climb sharply in recent weeks as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus spread swiftly through the population, especially among the unvaccinated. ""The NRA's top priority is ensuring the health and well-being of our members, staff, sponsors and supporters,"" the group said in its statement. ""We are mindful that NRA annual meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications."" The NRA, embroiled in allegations of graft and mismanagement, had sought to use Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reincorporate in Republican-dominated Texas and escape what it called a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York, where it was founded in 1871. But a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas dismissed the Chapter 11 filing in May, calling it an improper effort to avoid the lawsuit brought by James. In an amended complaint filed last week, James said the NRA's concealment of millions of dollars in questionable transactions, awarding perks to longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre and other insiders, had ""continued unabated"" since she first sued the nonprofit last August.

"High blood pressure driven by obesity, poverty - WHO study",1928,"GENEVA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Nearly 1.3 billion people globally suffer from hypertension, a silent killer often driven by obesity that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. Hypertension can be easily diagnosed by monitoring blood pressure, and treated with low-cost drugs, but half of affected people are unaware of their condition which is left untreated, the WHO and Imperial College London said in a joint study published in The Lancet. While hypertension rates have changed little in 30 years, the caseload has shifted to lower-income countries as wealthy nations have brought it largely under control, the study said. ""It is far from being a condition of affluence, it's very much a condition of poverty,"" Majid Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College London, told a news briefing. ""Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia, some of the Pacific island nations, they are still not getting the treatments that are needed,"" he said. Some 17.9 million people died in 2019 from cardiovascular diseases, accounting for one in three global deaths, with hypertension a major factor, according to the WHO. ""We know that the treatment is cheap, it's low cost medicines. But there is a need to include them in the UHC (universal health coverage) so this is not a cost for the patient, it has to be covered by the insurance system,"" said Bente Mikkelsen, director of the WHO's department of noncommunicable diseases. Apart from genetic risk factors for hypertension, there are ""modifiable risk factors"" linked to lifestyle, Mikkelsen said. These include unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes, and being overweight, she said. Referring to obesity, she said: ""This is really the tsunami of the risk factors"". Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Disney Cruise Line mandates vaccination on Bahamas ship,1064,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) cruise division said on Tuesday it will require vaccination proof from all passengers above the age of 12 traveling from Florida to the Bahamas, as the COVID-19 Delta variant sweeps across the United States.

It also plans to cancel the Sept. 4 ""Disney Fantasy"" sailing. Disney's cruise line had earlier said it did not insist on vaccinations, but the change in stance comes after the U.S. health regulator asked people at a high risk of severe COVID-19 illness to avoid cruises irrespective of vaccination status. read more The Bahamas, a major hub for cruises, has also said it would not allow those ships to dock in the country unless all passengers 12 and older provide proof of vaccination.

FTC urges judge to unwind $7.1 bln Illumina-Grail merger,2776,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it seeks to unwind life science company Illumina Inc's (ILMN.O) $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc (GRAL.O), alleging it would harm innovation and boost prices. FTC senior counsel Susan Musser said in her opening statement at a trial in Washington that cancer test-detection company Grail and its competitors rely on San Diego, California-based Illumina's DNA sequencing technology. She argued that Illumina's purchase of Grail would give the company the ""incentive and ability to foreclose downstream rivals."" Antitrust lawyers are closely tracking the FTC trial as a rare enforcement action against a ""vertical"" merger in which two companies are not direct competitors. The FTC's witnesses are expected to include representatives from other companies competing with Grail. ""Evidence will show that the war on cancer, if it is to be won, will be won by competition, not by this acquisition,"" Musser said. Grail is in an ""innovation race"" to develop and market its early-detection test, she added, and Illumina would have the power to ""anoint"" Grail the winner if the deal is not canceled. Illumina, founded in 1998, owned Grail but spun it off in 2016 while retaining a 12% ownership stake. Illumina and Grail closed their merger last week, saying no legal barrier blocked the deal. European antitrust regulators said on Friday they ""deeply regret"" the closure prior to regulatory approval. Illumina's attorney, David Marriott of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said in his opening statement that the ""reunion"" of Illumina and Grail would accelerate the development and adoption of an early cancer-detection product. ""The FTC's theory asks the court to forego the life-saving benefits of this transaction to avoid the potential harm that could not possibly occur for years - that could only occur, we submit, if other tests actually in fact ultimately are developed,"" Marriott said. He said the FTC theory ""needlessly gambles with human lives."" A lawyer for Grail said at trial that the company's merger with Illumina will provide the fastest way toward ""widespread commercial acceptance"" of its multi-cancer early detection test, which relies on a blood draw.

CVS Health mandates full COVID-19 vaccination for some employees,1463,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Health conglomerate CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) has mandated complete COVID-19 vaccination for its nurses, pharmacists and other employees who face patients, joining a string of U.S. firms seeking to slow the spread of the contagious Delta coronavirus variant. The policy, announced on Monday, comes after the U.S. health regulator granted full authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE . read more The approval is expected to spur a string of similar mandates from corporate employers. CVS said it would require all corporate staff to get fully vaccinated by October end and had asked recently hired employees to get their first COVID-19 shot before joining work. The company, which operates one of the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, had said earlier this month that employees at its worksites were required to wear masks or face covers, regardless of their vaccination status. Pharmacists at its retail stores will have until Nov. 30 to get fully vaccinated, the company had added. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) has said it is requiring staff at support offices to be fully vaccinated. read more U.S. energy companies have already moved to require that employees receive vaccinations amid rising infection rates at home, with health surveys showing that energy workers remain among those most reluctant to get shots. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Missouri attorney general sues school districts that mandate masks,2006,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against school districts in his state that have required masks for students and teachers, calling the practice in a statement ""arbitrary and capricious."" The lawsuit filed in Boone County Circuit Court named Columbia Public Schools, its school board and its superintendent as defendants but also includes other schools that have issued such mandates. Columbia's school district, with about 19,000 pupils in the center of the Midwestern state, issued a mask mandate this month for all students, teachers and staff to protect against a surge in COVID-19 cases. ""We filed this suit today because we fundamentally don’t believe in forced masking, rather that parents and families should have the power to make decisions on masks, based on science and facts,"" Schmitt said in a statement. The lawsuit asked the court to rule the mask mandate is unlawful and to block the district from carrying it out. The lawsuit is one of several court battles being waged in the United States over masking and COVID vaccinations as educators, parents and lawmakers grapple with another coronavirus surge just as students head back to the classroom. In Florida, the state Board of Education on Friday ordered two school districts to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that their children wear masks or face having some of their state funding withheld. On Tuesday, the Broward County School Board, which oversees a system of 261,000 students, said it rejected the order. Columbia Public Schools officials were not available for comment on Tuesday. On Aug. 13, when the district announced the masking requirement, it cited a high rate of transmission of the Delta variant in the community. ""We know not everyone will agree with this decision,"" the district said in a statement. ""This decision is not a forever decision, but it is a decision that is currently necessary.""

U.S. VP Harris forges on with Vietnam trip despite mystery 'health incident',3735,"HANOI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris pushed ahead with a trip to Vietnam on Tuesday after delaying the visit over concerns due to a health incident potentially related to the mysterious Havana syndrome. Harris arrived in the Southeast Asian country's capital after a three-hour delay in Singapore that the U.S. government blamed on reports that someone in Hanoi may have been targeted by the Havana syndrome, a condition of unknown origin with symptoms including dizziness, nausea, migraines and memory lapses. The incident upstaged a bid by President Joe Biden's top deputy to woo the allies Washington hopes will help it challenge China's assertive foreign policy in the region. Beijing, meanwhile, attempted to stage its own diplomatic coup with a surprise meeting in Vietnam and a donation of 2 million COVID-19 vaccines to the country. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Havana syndrome case was reported in Vietnam before Harris' departure but not confirmed. A safety assessment was done before sending Harris to the country, she said. ""The Vice President's office was made aware of a report of a recent possible anomalous health incident in Hanoi,"" the local U.S. Embassy said. Some 200 U.S. officials and kin, including CIA officers, have been sickened by ""Havana syndrome,"" CIA Director William Burns has said. A U.S. National Academy of Sciences panel in December found that a plausible theory is that ""directed energy"" beams caused the syndrome, which is so named because it first was reported by American officials based in the U.S. embassy in Cuba in 2016. The CIA sees a ""very strong possibility"" that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, but is withholding definitive conclusions pending further investigation. Moscow denies involvement. VIETNAM SAYS IT PICKS NO SIDES The incident came as Washington faces icy relations with another global competitor, China. As Harris's trip to Vietnam was delayed, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh held the unannounced meeting with Chinese Ambassador Xiong Bo, during which Chinh said Vietnam does not align itself with one country against any other. Earlier on Tuesday, Harris had accused Beijing of coercion and intimidation to back claims in the South China Sea, her most pointed comments on China during a visit to Southeast Asia, a region she said is critical to U.S. security. ""The Prime Minister affirmed that Vietnam adheres to an independent, self-reliant, multilateral, and diverse foreign policy and is a responsible member of the international community,"" the Vietnamese government said in a statement. ""Vietnam does not align itself with one country against another,"" it said. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be settled according to international law and ""high-level common sense,"" it said. The U.S. administration has called rivalry with China ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of the century. ""The fact that China's ambassador insisted on a meeting with the Vietnamese prime minister shortly before Harris landed shows how anxious Beijing is that its communist neighbor may tilt toward the U.S.,"" said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. During the meeting, Chinh thanked the ambassador for the vaccine donation. It was not immediately clear which vaccine China had donated. Vietnam had successfully contained the coronavirus for most of last year but since April has been dealing with a large COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. Just under 2% of its 98 million people are fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Greece to end free COVID-19 tests for unvaccinated, infections hit new record",1960,"ATHENS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Greece said on Tuesday it would end free testing for unvaccinated people to encourage them to get inoculated and head off any renewed spike in Delta variant infections of the coronavirus. Health authorities reported 4,608 new confirmed cases and 32 related deaths on Tuesday, with the daily tally of infections hitting a new record, surpassing 4,340 cases in March this year. The country has recorded a total of 566,812 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and 13,466 deaths since reporting its first COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020. Health authorities said that only 27 cases in Tuesday's infection tally were ""imported"", meaning they were detected after checks at border entry points. New measures to come into effect on Sept. 13 stop short of forcing people to take a jab, but end free testing and oblige unvaccinated persons to test either once or twice a week, depending on their profession. The costs of the rapid test, set at 10 euros ($12), is a sizeable chunk of money for people in crisis-hit Greece where salaries average 1,161 euros ($1,363.48) a month. Authorities said some six million people in the country of 11 million had already received one or two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, but that a million more were needed to build adequate immunity through the population. ""In contrast to autumn of last year, this autumn everyone can be vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias. ""Do we live, or play Russian roulette with the coronavirus?"" Free testing for vaccinated people will continue, he said. ""These measures are not punitive. They are our duty to all those who went through 18 months of the pandemic carefully, those who lost their shops, jobs, had to work from home to protect themselves.""

California to boost solar and wind capacity to meet renewable goals,1754,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region plans to increase its solar and wind power capacity in 2021 to help meet the state's target of 50% renewable generation by 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday. The CAISO plans to add an additional 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity and 0.4 GW of onshore wind turbine capacity this year, the EIA said in a release. CAISO is also planning to add 2.5 GW of battery storage capacity this year, the EIA said. These batteries could be charged using renewable power generation that would otherwise have been curtailed, it added. Additionally, two projects are being developed to facilitate hydrogen production and hydrogen-based energy storage, which could also help reduce curtailments of excess solar output. Excess supply from renewable sources has prompted the grid to increasingly curtail solar and wind generation at times, even as it struggles to balance its clean energy push with the need to boost tight power supplies and avoid rolling blackouts amid heatwaves. California said earlier this month it would lean more on fossil fuels in coming weeks to keep the power on if scorching heatwaves stretch its grid, demonstrating the challenges grids face by relying more on large amounts of wind and solar energy that only run when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. read more Other Top Sustainable Business stories Deutsche fund arm faces US probe over sustainable investments Breakingviews: Maersk’s green ships have first-mover disadvantage Dust at BHP's iron ore mines poses health hazard-union Denmark, Costa Rica seek alliance to speed up the end of oil and gas Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SEC fines Healthcare Services Group for concealing legal settlements, inflating earnings",1760,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Healthcare Services Group Inc (HCSG.O) willpay a $6 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that its failure to account for legal settlements with its employees enabled it to inflate quarterly results, the regulator said on Tuesday. The SEC said the Bensalem, Pennsylvania-based provider of housekeeping and dining services to healthcare facilities did not set aside enough money in 2014 and 2015 for expected settlements of class-action litigation claiming it violated federal and state wage-and-hour laws. Had the company properly recorded its settlement costs, it would have missed Wall Street earnings forecasts at least four times and been unable to report multiple quarters of increased earnings per share, thereby misleading investors, the SEC said. The SEC called the settlement the third in its EPS Imitative, which uses risk-based data analysis to uncover potential accounting and disclosure violations resulting from so-called ""earnings management,"" among other things. John Shea, Healthcare Services' chief financial officer since 2012, will pay a related $50,000 civil fine and accepted a two-year suspension from appearing before the SEC as an accountant. The company said he will become chief administrative officer on Sept. 1. It did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

Afghan evacuation on 'war footing' as G7 meets on pullout deadline,6216,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Western troops at Kabul airport worked frantically on Tuesday to evacuate people from Afghanistan before an Aug. 31 deadline as U.S. President Joe Biden faced growing pressure to negotiate more time for the airlift of thousands trying to flee. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - were due to meet virtually on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push for a deadline extension. Chaos punctuated by sporadic violence has gripped the airport, with foreign troops and Afghan security guards driving back crowds clamouring to get on flights following the Taliban's takeover of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15. Countries that have evacuated some 58,700 people over the past 10 days were trying to meet the deadline agreed earlier with the Taliban for the withdrawal of foreign forces, a NATO diplomat told Reuters. ""Every foreign force member is working at a war-footing pace to meet the deadline,"" said the official, who declined to be identified. Biden, who has said U.S. troops might stay beyond the deadline, has warned the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. A Taliban official said on Monday an extension would not be granted, though he said foreign forces had not sought one. Washington said negotiations were continuing. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday, two U.S. sources told Reuters. Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the days remaining. ""It's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. British defence minister Ben Wallace told Sky News he was doubtful there would be a deadline extension. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany was working with the United States and Britain to ensure the NATO allies can fly civilians out after the deadline. ""Even if the deadline is Aug. 31 or is extended by a few days, it will not be enough to evacuate those we want to evacuate and those that the United States wants to evacuate,"" Maas told Bild newspaper. ""That's why we are working with the United States and Britain to ensure that once the military evacuation is completed it is still possible to fly civilians out of Kabul airport.""

At the same time, he said, Russia opposes the idea of allowing Afghan refugees to enter the ex-Soviet region of Central Asia or having United States troops deployed there. ""If you think that any country in Central Asia or elsewhere is interested in becoming a target so that the Americans could fulfil their initiatives, I really doubt anyone needs that,"" Lavrov said during a visit to Hungary. RED LINE The frantic evacuation operation kicked off after the Taliban seized Kabul on Aug. 15 and the U.S.-backed government collapsed as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after a 20-year presence. The militant group had been ousted by U.S.-led forces in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants whose leaders had found safe haven in Afghanistan. Many Afghans fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Taliban enforced when in power from 1996 to 2001, in particular the repression of women. The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said she had received credible reports of serious violations committed by the Taliban, including summary execution of civilians and restrictions on women and protests against their rule. read more ""A fundamental red line will be the Taliban's treatment of women and girls,"" she told an emergency session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. An Afghan diplomat from the former government told the forum that millions of people feared for their lives amid reports of door-to-door searches. China's U.N. envoy said the U.S. army and its partners should be held accountable for rights violations they committed in Afghanistan. The G7 leaders could discuss taking a united stand on the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government, or alternatively renew sanctions to pressure the Islamist militant movement to comply with pledges to respect women's rights and international relations. ""The G7 leaders will agree to coordinate on if, or when, to recognise the Taliban,"" said one European diplomat. ""And they will commit to continue to work closely together."" Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government that have included discussions with some old enemies from past governments, including a former president, Hamid Karzai. The Pajhwok news agency reported that Taliban officials had been appointed to various posts including a governor of Kabul, acting interior and finance ministers and intelligence chief. A Taliban spokesman was not available for comment. Recognition of a Taliban government by other countries would have important consequences, like allowing the Taliban access to foreign aid that previous Afghan governments have depended upon. Biden has faced widespread criticism over the withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, under a deal struck with the Taliban, and his opinion poll ratings have slipped. While Western countries have been trying to get people out, humanitarian agencies are struggling to get aid in. The World Health Organization only has enough supplies in Afghanistan to last for a week, an agency official said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Paralympics set to open in Tokyo amid worsening COVID-19 crisis,2557,"TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The 2020 Paralympic Games will kick off in Tokyo with the opening ceremony on Tuesday as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak so far, record daily cases and an overwhelmed medical system. The organisers admitted last week that the Paralympics will be held under ""very difficult"" circumstancesas Japan's health situation has worsened since the Olympic Games ended on Aug. 8 and hospitals in the host city are filled to capacity. The Japanese government and the Tokyo Metropolitan government appealed on Monday to hospitals in the capital to accept more COVID-19 patients as increasing infections have made access to care increasingly difficult. ""I'm a little concerned about holding the Paralympic Games. Still, I hope the athletes will do their best,"" said 52-year-old office worker Chika Sasagawa. While the number of athletes and officials travelling from abroad is less than a third of that during the Olympics, Japan reported more than 25,000 daily cases on three days last week, up from less than 15,000 when the Olympics ended earlier this month. Organisers of the Paralympics, which will take place between Aug. 24 and Sept. 5, have said they plan to implement the same COVID-19 protocols or ""playbook"" as the ones used during the Olympics. Frequent testing and other restrictions, such as limiting the movement of athletes and officials, proved to be effective in minimising infection risks during the Games, they have added. Like the Olympics, the Paralympics will also take place generally without spectators and organisers have asked the domestic Games officials to avoid eating out or drinking in groups. Olympic organisers reported404 Games-related infections. They carried out close to 600,000 screening tests with an infection rate of 0.02%. Japan has extended COVID-19 emergency measures in the capital and other regions that will run through the Games.

"EXCLUSIVE Venezuela swapped PDVSA oil for food, then punished the dealmakers",8095,"CARACAS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - With U.S. sanctions spooking key oil buyers and depriving its government of cash, Venezuela last year inked a deal with a little-known local company to swap crude for food, Reuters has learned. That agreement saw state oil company PDVSA, beginning in December 2020, deliver more than 6 million barrels of crude worth nearly $260 million to a company named Supraquimic C.A., which was to supply food for a government program. But the arrangement collapsed when PDVSA accused two executives linked to Supraquimic with embezzling the proceeds, according to criminal charges filed by Venezuelan prosecutors in late March. This account of the deal and its demise is based on dozens of pages of internal PDVSA documents viewed by Reuters, court filings by prosecutors, and interviews with three people familiar with the situation. It offers a rare glimpse inside one of the maneuvers that Venezuela's socialist government devised to continue exporting crude - the lifeblood of its beleaguered economy - despite U.S. sanctions. Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil or information ministries or chief prosecutor's office responded to requests for comment. President Nicolas Maduro has called U.S. sanctions illegal and blames Washington and his domestic political opponents for the country's woes. The Supraquimic deal is also the latest example of how Venezuela, cut off from the global financial system and short of hard currency after years of economic decline, has turned to bartering its crude. It has previously used oil to pay down debts, buy gasoline and diesel, and purchase water trucks. Maduro has even proposed using oil to buy coronavirus vaccines. Just as important, the Supraquimic deal provided PDVSA with a new customer. Since the United States blacklisted PDVSA in early 2019, many major clients have stopped buying. In their place, a series of mysterious, recently-formed companies with no previous oil experience have materialized to buy PDVSA's oil, including previously-unknown Mexican and Russian firms. Purchases by these new players have allowed Venezuela's crude exports to climb sharply this year, internal PDVSA shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data show. ""It is amazing how Venezuela has mutated to overcome difficulties coming from sanctions, which is making Venezuela's oil trade increasingly opaque,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute. It's all part of a cat-and-mouse game that Caracas is playing with U.S. authorities to keep selling its most important commodity. Washington has barred American companies from purchasing Venezuelan oil and has threatened to punish firms based anywhere in the world that do business with PDVSA. ""Maduro and his supporters have attempted to exploit U.S. policy in support of humanitarian related transactions by disguising their attempts to squeeze profit from Venezuelan resources as oil-for-food schemes,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. ""We do not preview our sanctions, but of course evasion schemes may prove vulnerable to sanctions,"" the statement read. The Supraquimic deal also demonstrates potential perils for companies doing business with Venezuela's government, which has sparred repeatedly with the private sector even as the Socialist Party has courted their investment to boost the economy. In 2015, for example, with Venezuela rocked by shortages of consumer goods, authorities detained executives of a pharmacy chain and workers at a leading food company on accusations of hoarding supply to destabilize the economy, which they denied. Venezuela's industrialists have blamed Maduro's socialist economic policies for the nation's woes. ""The main risk to doing business with the government is not that you're going to lose money or that your assets are going to be expropriated. It's that you're going to end up in jail,"" said Jose Ignacio Hernandez, a specialist in Venezuelan administrative law and economic regulation at the Harvard Kennedy School and the former legal representative for Venezuela's opposition. Venezuela's Information Ministry did not reply to a request for a response to Hernandez's assertions. Such tensions were on display again on March 30, when Venezuelan authorities issued arrest warrants for Supraquimic President Oscar Garcia as well as Jose Llamozas, who owns firms that sold food to Supraquimic. Both were charged with embezzlement, collusion between a public official and a contractor, and illicit association, according to the prosecutor's request to a judge for the warrant. Garcia, whose whereabouts are unknown, did not respond to phone calls, emails and messages to social media profiles seeking comment. Reuters could not determine whether Garcia was ever arrested or if he has legal representation. Llamozas, who was jailed for three months before being released on July 2 pending a possible trial, did not respond to messages sent to phone numbers and email addresses listed for his companies. Llamozas' defense counsel did not respond to requests for comment. In Venezuela, prosecutors first charge a suspect and then investigate further before deciding whether or not to recommend to a judge that the case go forward, according to Jose Vicente Haro, a law professor at the Central University of Venezuela. 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCE' The arrangement between PDVSA and Supraquimic began with a request from Venezuela's Food Ministry to ensure supply for its CLAP boxes, a food handout program that many families depend on to survive, according to a copy of a contract between the two companies and the ministry which was viewed by Reuters. That contract, dated April 2020 and described as a ""strategic alliance,"" stipulated that Supraquimic would receive up to 5 million barrels of crude per month from PDVSA in exchange for supplying food products of equal value to the Food Ministry. Supraquimic, in turn, would be responsible for selling the oil. Supraquimic was founded by Garcia in Caracas in 2015, according to government commercial registry records. In total, the company received from PDVSA six cargoes between Dec. 28, 2020 and Feb. 10, 2021, totaling 6.2 million barrels valued at $257.8 million, according to internal oil company invoices viewed by Reuters. That was in line with market prices at the time. All the shipments set sail in tankers bound for Asia, according to the PDVSA invoices and shipping documents, and Refinitiv Eikon data. Reuters could not determine how much food, if any, Supraquimic delivered to the CLAP program. But according to a March 4 letter written to company officials by Antonio Perez Suarez, PDVSA's vice president for supply and trading, it was not enough to satisfy the agreement. ""You have not honored your payment commitments according to the contractual terms established and accepted by your company,"" Perez Suarez wrote in that letter, viewed by Reuters. Supraquimic does not appear to be a food manufacturer. It purchased products from Venezuelan companies including Alimentos Santa Lucia and Agroinsumos El Granero, both owned by Llamozas, according to a person familiar with the deal. Llamozas' companies agreed to sell food items totaling $80 million to Supraquimic in installments, the person said. But after receiving payment for delivery of an initial $8 million worth of products, Llamozas' firms stopped shipping because they received no further funds, leaving Supraquimic unable to meet its obligations to the government, the person said. On March 30, Llamozas was summoned to PDVSA's offices, according to the person. He was arrested in the oil company's parking lot, according to the police arrest report. While Llamozas was in jail, Maduro found another source of help to feed some of the estimated 7 million Venezuelans experiencing food insecurity in what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest nations. The U.N. World Food Programme in April reached a deal with his administration to deliver monthly rations to school children. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Amid COVID surge, some Sri Lankans opt for cardboard coffins",2247,"COLOMBO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - At a factory in Sri Lanka's Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia city, workers use staples and glue to assemble long cardboard boxes, which will be used as coffins for some of the country's coronavirus victims. The coffin is made out of recycled paper and costs a sixth of the cheapest wooden casket, according to 51-year old Priyantha Sahabandu, the local government official who first came up with the idea. As Sri Lanka's death toll from COVID-19 surges, some are opting for these cardboard coffins when they cremate their loved ones. The country recorded its highest daily death toll of 198 on Friday, with total fatalities reaching 7,560. Currently, about 400 people die per day on average in Sri Lanka of various causes, including COVID-19, said Sahabandu, a member of the municipal council for Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, a city in Colombo district. ""To make 400 coffins you have to cut some 250 to 300 trees. To prevent that environmental destruction I proposed this concept to the health committee of the council,"" he said. ""With the spread of the coronavirus, people found it difficult to pay for expensive wooden coffins,"" he said.

REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte Each coffin costs around 4,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($22.56), compared with 30,000 rupees for a cheap wooden coffin, Sahabandu said. It can hold up to 100 kilograms. The coffins were initially used mostly for COVID-19 victims, but have become more popular among those concerned about the environment. Some 350 cardboard coffins have been delivered since early 2020, and the factory is working on another 150 ordered by the council. ""The majority of the people in the country support this. The issue today is supplying it. We are working on that,"" Sahabandu said. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced a total lockdown on Friday for ten days to curb a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant.

U.S. donation of COVID-19 vaccines arrives in West Bank and Gaza,1783,"RAMALLAH, West Bank, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. donation of 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza on Tuesday, as Palestinian officials work to boost uptake and counter a surge in new cases by requiring some workers to get the jab. The Palestinians began administering vaccines in February, but despite having purchased or received what officials have called ""an abundance of doses"", uptake has stalled at just 35% of age-eligible Palestinians in the West Bank, and around 11% in Gaza. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, whose Palestinian Authority (PA) has limited self-rule in the West Bank, said on Monday that unvaccinated public-sector employees would be put on unpaid leave, with immediate effect. Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas are requiring all working individuals and service providers to take the vaccine by Sept. 1, Hamas interior ministry spokesman Iyad al-Bozum wrote on Twitter. With the U.S. donation of 500,000 Moderna (MRNA.O) doses, facilitated through the global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, the Palestinians say they have now received 2.5 million doses. The West Bank will take 300,000 of the donation and Gaza 200,000. Officials also expect to receive 1 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine in September. New infections have spiked since the emergence of the highly-infectious Delta variant. PA Health Minister Mai Alkaila said the Palestinians are ""on the precipice of a fourth wave in terms of cases, deaths and hospital occupancy"".

U.S. review of COVID's China origin unlikely to solve vexing questions,3648,"WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is set to be briefed on the U.S. intelligence community's investigation into how COVID-19 started, with the report likely to disappoint in delivering clear answers about the deadly pandemic's origin in China. Biden in May ordered aides to work to resolve disputes among intelligence agencies examining rival theories about how the novel coronavirus started, including a once-dismissed theory about the possibility of a laboratory accident in China, as well as that the virus originated naturally with animals, such as bats or birds. A 90-day intelligence review the president ordered is due on Tuesday, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, with the release of unclassified portions likely to take a few days longer. Yet three U.S. government officials and a fourth person familiar with the scope of the investigation said they did not expect the review to lead to firm conclusions after China stymied earlier international efforts to gather key information on the ground. Instead, one official said the report would likely point to additional lines of inquiry that officials could pursue, including demands of China that are likely to further ratchet up tensions with Beijing at a time when the country's ties with Washington are at their lowest point in decades. ""It's basically impossible to have a proper investigation if one of the main parties doesn't want to cooperate,"" said Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-author of ""Aftershocks,"" a book about the pandemic with Biden's Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl. ""We need to proceed as if both hypotheses are true."" The report also comes as the U.S. intelligence agencies have come under pressure from within the administration and Congress over issues related to the handling of Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban came faster than many U.S. intelligence, defense and diplomatic analysts predicted. COVID-19 has killed 4.6 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, but its precise origins remain shrouded in mystery. The first known cases emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and U.S. agencies started looking into the origins shortly afterwards. U.S. spy agencies initially strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. A team led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal. But their March report, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists and concluded that the lab theory was ""extremely unlikely,"" did not satisfy Washington. read more People familiar with intelligence reporting have said that there has been little corroboration over recent months that the virus had spread widely and naturally amongst wild animals. Meanwhile, China has refused to give U.S. researchers the kind of access to the Wuhan lab and officials there that the U.S. believes it would need to definitively try to determine the virus' origins. The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new group to further examine the origins of the virus causing COVID-19. For its part, China has ridiculed a theory that COVID-19 escaped from the state virology lab in Wuhan and pushed fringe theories including that the virus slipped out of a lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland, in 2019.

"German SPD ahead of conservatives a month before election, poll shows",2221,"BERLIN, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have pulled ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives for the first time in 15 years, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, just a month before the country's federal election. Germany goes to the polls on Sept. 26, when Merkel steps down as chancellor after 16 years in office and four straight national election victories. Merkel's imminent departure has heightened divisions over the direction of the party. Support for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been falling steadily in recent weeks. The SPD was up 2 percentage points compared to a week ago on 23%, while the CDU/CSU slipped a point to 22% and the Greens are down a point at 18%, according to the Forsa poll for RTL/NTV. Forsa said this was the first time that the SPD had been ahead of the CDU/CSU since October 2006, with the latest rating for Merkel's party at its lowest level since the polling institute was set up in 1984. Some conservatives have blamed the drop in support on the bloc's candidate for chancellor, CDU chairman Armin Laschet, whose ratings have tumbled since he was caught on camera laughing during a visit last month to a town hit by floods. Support for Laschet fell again in the Forsa poll, while it rose for the SPD's candidate, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. Health Minister Jens Spahn, a close Laschet ally, has ruled out suggestions that replacing Laschet with a more popular candidate, such as Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, was the only way to secure a comfortable victory. read more The CDU, which got just under 33% of the vote in the last election in 2017, currently govern in coalition with the SPD. The most recent polls mean that the only possible coalitions would need three parties to work together rather than the current two, potentially making negotiations more protracted. The Forsa poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.

Switzerland hit by 'very worrying' fourth COVID-19 wave,1284,"ZURICH, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronavirus with a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of the government's crisis team at the Federal Office for Public Health said on Tuesday. The number of new infections has hovered between 2,500 and 3,000 per day recently, close to the level of the third wave earlier this year, Patrick Mathys said. ""The current situation should be seen as unfavourable and to some extent very worrying,"" Mathys told a press conference in Bern. ""We have to describe the current situation as the fourth wave."" The number of new infections rose by 2,993 on Tuesday, taking the total number to 761,978 since the pandemic began. The government also reported six more deaths, taking the death toll to 10,461. Mathys said he was concerned about hospitals and the low level of vaccinations. Around 56% of the population have had at least one dose and 50% have had two. The vast majority of COVID-19 hospitalisations were of people who had not been vaccinated, Mathys said. ""The stagnating vaccination figures do not indicate that the situation could ease in the foreseeable future,"" Mathys said. ""The proportion of the non-immune population is still far too large.""

"China should avoid excessive, ""flood-like"" COVID measures -former CDC expert",1925,"BEIJING, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The benefits of China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 continue to outweigh the costs but it should cut back on excessive measures that risk exhausting people, a former Chinese disease control official said on Tuesday. Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said ""flood-like"" measures and policies that prove inefficient should be avoided even though China has the financial resources to keep pursuing the goal of zero local infections. Since late July, China has brought under control clusters of infections driven mainly by the highly transmissible Delta variant of the new coronavirus. That was achieved by swift contact tracing and locking down areas deemed high-risk, even when only a handful of cases were detected. In cities where most infections were found, multiple rounds of testing on local populations were undertaken and travel restrictions imposed. Those measures have required significant human resources and have disrupted the tourism, services and logistics sectors, prompting analysts to downgrade forecasts for China's economic growth for the quarter ending in September. ""It becomes more difficult for us to have zero infections with the Delta variant, and the cost (of achieving that) has increased,"" Zeng told an online presentation. ""But we still have to continue to (aim for) zero infections, because the dividends of doing so still exists."" Zeng was part of a top team at China's National Health Commission when the virus started to spread from the central city of Wuhan to other parts of China last year. Noting that China was the only major economy to grow last year, Zeng said ""we have the financial resources"" to support the zero-tolerance strategy. ""If we want to, we can tap (the equivalent of) one-tenth of our GDP growth to deal with Delta,"" he added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Iran's COVID-19 deaths hit record daily high of 709,1692,"DUBAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Iran on Tuesday reported a record daily 709 deaths from COVID-19 as the worst-hit country in the Middle East faced a fifth surge in infections led by the highly contagious Delta variant. The health ministry said the total number of cases had reached 4.75 million with 40,623 new infections over the past 24 hours. Total fatalities rose to 103,357, state TV reported. Authorities imposed a two-week road travel ban between cities in the Islamic Republic until Aug. 27, except for essential vehicles. Non-essential businesses and public offices were allowed to reopen on Sunday after a week of mandatory shutdown to help limit the spread of coronavirus infections. The government has not yet announced whether or not new restrictions will be imposed soon. Health authorities have warned that daily deaths might reach 800 in coming weeks if Iranians fail to respect health precautions. Social media users have criticised the government for being slow to vaccinate people - only about 6.5 million of the 83 million population are fully inoculated. Officials have blamed U.S. sanctions and delays in importing vaccines. Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from U.S. sanctions reimposed on Tehran in 2018 after President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme. But the U.S. measures, which target sectors including oil and financial activities, have deterred some foreign banks from processing financial transactions with Iran.

EXCLUSIVE Limited Chinese cooperation hindering U.S. fentanyl fight -congress report,4335,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Weak cooperation between U.S. and Chinese authorities is hindering efforts to curb increasingly sophisticated forms of fentanyl trafficking, according to a U.S. congressional advisory report reviewed by Reuters. The report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, due to be published on Tuesday, said U.S. authorities have found that cooperation with Chinese counterparts ""remains limited on the ground"". An explosion in the use of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin, and its analogues has driven the most devastating chapter of America's long-running opioid and drug abuse crises. Combating fentanyl smuggling has become a key priority for U.S. agencies as overdose deaths spiked to more than 93,000 in 2020, mostly linked to fentanyl, according to provisional data by the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths surged by more than 21,000 to eclipse a record set a year earlier. Despite China banning fentanyl and similar variants in 2019, the Asian nation remains the primary source of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked into the United States, the report said. The accusations are unreasonable and unacceptable, said the Chinese foreign ministry when asked by Reuters to comment on the report. China has strictly controlled all narcotics, psychotropic drugs and chemical precursors, and its efforts are recognised internationally, the ministry said. There have been some improvements in collaboration as U.S. officials have established working groups, conducted high-level meetings and shared information with Chinese partners that led to arrests. However, the advisory body warned there ""remain significant gaps in U.S.-China antidrug cooperation"". Chinese regulatory authorities delay requests for access to inspect and investigate potential sites where companies illegally manufacture precursor chemicals that Mexican and other foreign drug cartels use to produce fentanyl, it said. ""Requests are often delayed for days, allowing any illegal operation to vacate or clean up the premises"", the report said. Chinese cooperation also ""lags in money laundering investigations, criminal prosecution, and legal assistance in ongoing cases"", the advisory body added. ""The U.S. cannot harm China's interests while expecting China to cooperate unconditionally,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said. FENTANYL SHIPMENTS FALL The amount of finished fentanyl shipped from China to the United States has declined since 2019 when Beijing banned the synthetic drug. Yet illicit fentanyl from China remains widely available in the United States, the report said. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) believes Chinese traffickers have shifted from mainly manufacturing finished fentanyl to mostly exporting precursors to Mexican cartels, which make illicit fentanyl and deliver the final product. The authors of the congressional report, titled ""Illicit Fentanyl from China: An Evolving Global Operation"", warned that the sophistication of traffickers was growing and both Chinese and U.S. authorities were struggling to adapt. On top of relocating some manufacturing to India, Chinese traffickers were re-routing shipments via third countries and using new marketing methods to circumvent local regulations drafted by Beijing. ""China's weak supervision and regulation of its chemical and pharmaceutical industry also enable evasion and circumvention,"" the report said. Chinese traffickers are increasing their cooperation with Mexican cartels, and especially the two biggest crime syndicates, the Sinaloa cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Both groups operate ""pill mills"" in Mexican cities, where they manufacture illegal fentanyl to ship to the United States, a growing trend in recent years. ""The growing involvement of Mexican cartels and advanced money laundering schemes have exacerbated the problem"", the report said. Chinese criminals are increasingly using the Chinese banking system to launder Mexican drug money, the report said, citing an investigation by Reuters into how Chinese brokers were muscling out Colombian and Mexican money launderers. These Chinese brokers use financial technology, mobile banking apps and social media to evade authorities, the report said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel's COVID-19 vaccine boosters show signs of taming Delta,5176,"JERUSALEM, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Less than a month into a COVID-19 vaccine booster drive, Israel is seeing signs of an impact on the country's high infection and severe illness rates fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant, officials and scientists say. Delta hit Israel in June, just as the country began to reap the benefits of one of the world's fastest vaccine roll-outs. With an open economy and most curbs scrapped, Israel went from single-digit daily infections and zero deaths to around 7,500 daily cases last week, 600 people hospitalized in serious condition and more than 150 people dying in that week alone. On July 30, it began administering a third dose of the Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNtech (22UAy.DE) vaccine to people over 60, the first country to do so. On Thursday it expanded eligibility to 30-year-olds and up whose second dose was given at least 5 months prior, saying the age may drop further. In the past 10 days, the pandemic is abating among the first age group, more than a million of whom have received a third vaccine dose, according to Israeli health ministry data and scientists interviewed by Reuters. The rate of disease spread among vaccinated people age 60 and over - known as the reproduction rate - began falling steadily around Aug. 13 and has dipped below 1, indicating that each infected person is transmitting the virus to fewer than one other person. A reproduction rate of less than 1 means an outbreak is subsiding. https://tmsnrt.rs/3grj7kv Scientists said booster shots are having an impact on infections, but other factors are likely contributing to the decline as well. ""The numbers are still very high but what has changed is that the very high increase in the rate of infections and severe cases has diminished, as has the pace at which the pandemic is spreading,"" said Eran Segal, data scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science and an adviser to the government. ""This is likely due to the third booster shots, an uptake in people taking the first dose and the high number of people infected per week, possibly up to 100,000, who now have natural immunity,"" Segal said. BOOSTER VS LOCKDOWN After reaching one of the highest per-capita infection rates in the world this month, the question now is whether Israel can battle its way out of a fourth outbreak without imposing another lockdown that would damage its economy. An Israeli woman poses for a picture as she receives a third shot of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine as country launches booster shots for over 40-year-olds, in Jerusalem August 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo Evidence has emerged showing that while the vaccine is still highly effective in preventing serious illness, its protection diminishes with time. But there is no consensus among scientists and agencies that a third dose is necessary, and the World Health Organization has said more of the world should be vaccinated with a first dose before people receive a third dose. read more The United States has announced plans to offer booster doses to all Americans, eight months after their second vaccine dose, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have also planned booster campaigns. About a million of Israel's 9.3 million population have so far chosen not to vaccinate at all and children under 12 are still not eligible for the shots. On Thursday, health officials said they have identified waning immunity among people under 40, although relatively few have fallen seriously ill. read more According to Doron Gazit, a member of the Hebrew University's COVID-19 expert team which advises government, the rise in cases of severely ill vaccinated people in the 60 and older group has been steadily slowing to a halt in the last 10 days. ""We attribute this to the booster shots and to more cautious behaviour recently,"" Gazit said. More than half of those over 60 have received a third jab, according to the Health ministry. The rate of new severe cases among unvaccinated patients 70 and older is now seven times that of vaccinated patients, and the gap will continue to grow as long as infections rise, according to Gazit. Among those over 50, that gap is four-fold. ""We are optimistic, but very cautious,"" Israeli Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz told public broadcaster Kan on Sunday. ""It gives us more time, slows the spread and we're moving away from lockdown."" But even if the boosters are slowing the pandemic's pace, it is unlikely to fend Delta off entirely. Dvir Aran, biomedical data scientist at Technion - Israel's Institute of Technology, said that while cases are retreating, other measures are needed alongside boosters to stop the pandemic. ""It will take a long time until enough people get a third dose and until then thousands more people will getting seriously ill."" Since Delta's surge, Israel has reimposed indoor mask wearing, limitations on gatherings and ramped up rapid testing. Its ""living with COVID"" policy will be tested come September, when schools reopen after summer break and when the Jewish holiday season starts, with families traditionally gathering to celebrate.

Afghan evacuation on 'war footing' as G7 meets on pullout deadline,5429,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Western forces at Kabul airport worked frantically on Tuesday to get people out of Afghanistan before an Aug. 31 deadline, as U.S. President Joe Biden faced growing pressure to negotiate more time for the airlift of thousands trying to flee. Widespread chaos punctuated by sporadic violence has gripped Kabul's airport, with Western troops and Afghan security guards driving back crowds, following the Taliban's takeover of the Afghan capital on Aug. 15. Countries that have evacuated some 58,700 people over the past 10 days were trying to meet the deadline agreed earlier with the Taliban for the withdrawal of foreign forces, a NATO diplomat told Reuters. ""Every foreign force member is working at a war-footing pace to meet the deadline,"" said the official, who declined to be identified. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - will meet virtually on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push for a deadline extension. Biden, who has said U.S. troops might stay beyond the deadline, has warned the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the days remaining. ""It's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. A Taliban official said on Monday an extension would not be granted, though he said foreign forces had not sought one. Washington said negotiations were continuing. CIA Director William Burns met Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday, the Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Reuters could not immediately verify the story. Britain's defence minister, Ben Wallace, told Sky News he was doubtful there would be a deadline extension. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany was working with the United States and Britain to ensure the NATO partners can fly civilians out after the deadline.

Samuel Ruiz/Handout via REUTERS. ""Even if the deadline is Aug. 31 or is extended by a few days, it will not be enough to evacuate those we want to evacuate and those that the United States wants to evacuate,"" Maas said in an interview with Bild newspaper. ""That's why we are working with the United States and Britain to ensure that once the military evacuation is completed it is still possible to fly civilians out of Kabul airport."" RED LINE Many Afghans fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Taliban enforced when in power from 1996 to 2001, in particular the repression of women and freedom of speech. The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said she had received credible reports of serious violations committed by the Taliban, including summary execution of civilians and restrictions on women and protests against their rule. read more ""A fundamental red line will be the Taliban's treatment of women and girls,"" she told an emergency session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. An Afghan diplomat from the U.S.-backed government told the forum that millions of people feared for their lives amid reports of door-to-door searches while China's U.N. envoy said the U.S. army and its partners should be held accountable for rights violations they committed in Afghanistan. The G7 leaders could discuss taking a united stand on the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government, or alternatively renew sanctions to pressure the Islamist militant movement to comply with pledges to respect women's rights and international relations. ""The G7 leaders will agree to coordinate on if, or when, to recognise the Taliban,"" said one European diplomat. ""And they will commit to continue to work closely together."" Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government that have included discussions with some old enemies from past governments, including a former president, Hamid Karzai. The Pajhwok news agency reported that Taliban officials had been appointed to various posts including a governor of Kabul, acting interior and finance ministers and intelligence chief. A Taliban spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Recognition of a Taliban government by other countries would have important consequences, like allowing the Taliban access to foreign aid that previous Afghan governments have depended upon. Biden has faced widespread criticism over the Aug. 31 withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, under a deal struck with the Taliban, and his opinion poll ratings have slipped. While Western countries have been trying to get people out, humanitarian agencies are struggling to get aid in. The World Health Organization only has enough supplies in Afghanistan to last for a week, an agency official said. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Afghan refugees in Indonesia call for expedited resettlement,1674,"JAKARTA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Afghan refugees protested in Indonesia on Tuesday against a prolonged resettlement process, saying they needed to be offered new homes now that repatriation was out of the question with the return of the Taliban. Thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, most of them from the Hazara ethnic minority, who have long been persecuted by the Taliban, have lived in Indonesia for years as they await resettlement in third countries such as Canada or Australia. On Tuesday, hundreds gathered outside the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the capital, Jakarta, despite coronavirus restrictions prohibiting demonstrations, to demand that their cases be expedited. ""In the past year the UNHCR has been telling us there is only one percent chance of resettlement,” refugee Hakmat Ziraki told Reuters. ""Today we come here to ask 'what is your answer now? Are you still encouraging voluntary repatriation?'."" ""Our people are dying every day,"" he said. ""We need some justice, we need resettlement.” A spokesperson for the UNHCR said that the situation in Afghanistan did not have any impact on the status of refugees in Indonesia or elsewhere and their resettlement programme was going on as usual. Indonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugees and is predominately seen as a transit country for those seeking asylum to a third country. Tuesday's protest saw minor scuffles between police after demonstrators were warned to disperse given the public health risks, with the capital still recovering from a wave of coronavirus infections.

Delta cases show 300 times higher viral load - S.Korea study,1770,"SEOUL, Aug 24 (Reuters) - People infected with the more transmissible Delta variant have a viral load 300 times higher than those with the original version of the COVID-19 virus, when symptoms are first observed, a South Korea study found. But the amount gradually decreased over time - to 30 times in four days and over 10 times in nine days - and it matched levels seen in other variants after 10 days, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Tuesday. The higher load means the virus spreads far more easily from person to person, increasing infections and hospitalisations, a health ministry official Lee Sang-won told a news conference. ""But it doesn't mean Delta is 300 times more infectious...we think its transmission rate is 1.6 times the Alpha variant, and about two times the original version of the virus,"" Lee said. The Delta variant of the novel coronavirus was first identified in India and the Alpha variant in the UK. To avoid the spread of the Delta variant, now the dominant strainworldwide, the KDCA urged people to immediately get tested when developing COVID-19 symptoms and avoid in-person meetings. The rapid spread of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates have caught much of Asia off-guard, especially in emerging markets, even as economies in Europe and North America reopen. read more The study compared the viral load of 1,848 patients infected with the Delta variant with 22,106 people who had other strains. South Korea reported 1,509 new coronavirus cases for Monday, raising the total to 239,287 infections, with 2,228 deaths. It has vaccinated 51.2% of its 52 million population with at least one dose of a vaccine, while 23.9% have been fully vaccinated. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Six U.S. states do not join $26 bln opioid settlements with distributors, J&J",3438,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - At least six U.S. states, including Georgia, did not fully sign on to a proposed $26 billion settlement with three drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which have been accused of fueling the nation's opioid epidemic, according to the states' attorneys general. States had until Saturday to decide whether to support the $21 billion proposed settlement with McKesson Corp (MCK.N), AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and a separate $5 billion agreement with J&J. But in a sign that talks were continuing despite the passing of the deadline, Georgia - the most populous hold-out state - on Monday indicated it could wind up backing the agreement. ""We have not rejected the deal, but we have not joined because at the present time joining the national settlements does not guarantee the best outcome for Georgia and its counties, cities and citizens,"" said an emailed statement from the office of the attorney general, Christopher Carr. ""We remain active in representing Georgia throughout negotiations, and we’re going to continue to get input from Georgia stakeholders."" The state will litigate its claims if needed, the statement said. New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia also declined to join the deals, their state attorneys general said. New Hampshire agreed to the settlement with distributors but not the J&J agreement. The complex settlement formula envisions at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies get to decide whether a ""critical mass"" has joined and whether to finalize the deal. The size of the settlement is based on the number of participating states. Those that decline to join will instead seek a larger recovery by continuing to fight the defendants in the courts. The companies have already paid hundreds of millions in verdicts and other settlements. The deal, which was unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21, aims to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction. The money would go toward funding treatment and other services. The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with others, including doctors and regulators. McKesson said the companies have until Sept. 4 to determine if there is sufficient support for the agreements and said that process is ongoing. Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen declined to comment and J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The support of two other states, Nevada and Alabama, also appeared to be in doubt, according to sources familiar with the situation. Nevada's attorney general declined to comment and the Alabama attorney general did not respond to a request for comment. The participation of states is tied closely to that of their local governments, which brought the majority of the lawsuits. Cities and counties within participating states would have through Jan. 2 to sign on. Ultimately, $10.7 billion of the settlement money is tied to the extent to which localities participate. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead negotiator, last month said he expected ""well north"" of 40 states to join. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israel bombs Hamas sites in Gaza over fire balloons -military,2512,"TEL AVIV, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Israeli warplanes bombed Hamas sites in Gaza in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave that caused brush fires in southern Israel, its military said early on Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the air strikes that targeted what the military said was a weapons production facility and a rocket launch site belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. Since an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire halted 11 days of Israel-Hamas fighting in May, Gaza militants have sporadically sent balloons carrying incendiary material into Israel, drawing Israeli strikes on Hamas facilities. Palestinians say the balloons are aimed at pressing Israel to ease restrictions on Gaza and allow aid to reach the territory. Balloons launched on Monday set off fires in Israeli fields along the Gaza border, Israel's Fire and Rescue Service said. Cross-border violence has spiked despite an Israeli announcement last week of a resumption of Qatari aid to Gaza, a decision that had been seen as bolstering the fragile truce. read more Confronting Gaza protesters burning tyres and throwing explosives along the border on Saturday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 41 Palestinians, critically injuring two, medics said. Palestinian gunfire seriously wounded an Israeli soldier, the military said. read more Days before Saturday's violence, Gaza militants launched a rocket towards Israel that was shot down by its Iron Dome anti-missile system, in the first such attack since the May 21 ceasefire. More than 250 Palestinians and 13 in Israel were killed in the May conflict, during which Gaza militants fired rockets towards Israeli cities and Israel carried out air strikes across the coastal enclave. Israel keeps Gaza under blockade, tightly restricting movement out of the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians. Egypt also maintains restrictions on the enclave. Both cite threats from Hamas for the restrictions. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 15-year-old was killed overnight in a clash with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military said its troops came under fire during an arrest raid near the city of Nablus. A soldier opened fire on a suspect who was about to throw a large object at the forces from a rooftop, the military said, and ""identified a hit"". The health ministry said a 15-year-old Palestinian was killed in the confrontation. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
COVID-19 booster shots should follow after China inoculates more -state media,1705,"BEIJING, Aug 24 (Reuters) - COVID-19 booster shots should become available in China after the country vaccinates more people to provide broader protection against the disease, a senior executive at a Sinopharm unit responsible for developing COVID-19 vaccines told state media. While the World Health Organization has said current data does not indicate booster shots are needed, several countries have approved them amid resurgent infections and concerns of waning vaccine protection over time, especially against the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Zhang Yuntao, vice president at Sinopharm unit China National Biotec Group (CNBG), said that it is proper to make booster shots available in China after ""all people who should be vaccinated are vaccinated,"" according to an interview with the Global Times published late on Monday. He said the priority for booster shots should be given to people older than 60 who showed weaker immune responses to vaccines compared with younger people in clinical trials. Employees at restaurants and those working in aviation and delivery industries should also be prioritised, he said. China has fully vaccinated around 55% of its population as of Aug. 12, using several locally developed shots including two-dose vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O). The two companies said studies have showed that injecting a third dose led to a significant increase in antibodies, which faded over time after a two-course regimen. A lab study showed antibodies triggered by the Sinovac shot declined below a key threshold from around six months after a second dose for most recipients. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

New Zealand COVID-19 Delta outbreak spreading rapidly as cases jump,2551,"WELLINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand on Tuesday recorded its highest increase in COVID-19 cases since April 2020, as authorities warned this current outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus was like dealing with a whole new virus. The South Pacific nation's virus-free run since February ended last week after an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and quickly spread to the capital Wellington. Authorities reported 41 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total infections in the country to 148, the Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference. That was the biggest increase in cases since April 10, 2020, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Of the new cases, 38 are in Auckland and three are in Wellington. So far, eight people associated with the current outbreak are in hospital, the ministry said. ""Delta is unlike our previous experience. It is, as we know, highly infectious and transmissible and, as we have seen, spreads rapidly,” Bloomfield said at a news conference. But he said it was reassuring to see the numbers were not rising exponentially and the majority were still in Auckland. CHURCH CLUSTER Authorities reported a cluster of at least 58 people of Samoan ethnicity and linked to the Samoan Assembly Of God Church in Auckland. The health ministry said there were unfortunately racist comments being directed at the community. ""The virus is the problem, not people,"" the ministry said on Twitter. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has garnered global praise for stamping out COVID-19 in the country. But her reliance on strict border controls and snap lockdowns that have impacted the economy has been called into question amid the latest outbreak, which has occurred while few people have been vaccinated. read more On Monday, Ardern extended the strict level 4 national lockdown to Aug. 27. In neighbouring Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is also under growing pressure for rising COVID-19 cases, said elimination cannot be pursued forever, flagging New Zealand as an example. ""Any state and territory that thinks that somehow they can protect themselves from COVID with the Delta strain forever, that's just absurd,"" he told the 9News breakfast show Today. ""I mean, New Zealand can't do that. They were following an elimination strategy. They're in lockdown. The way through is to get to those 70% and 80% (vaccination) marks, open safely,"" he said.

"Pandemic threatens Asia-Pacific's progress on global development goals, says ADB",2083,"MANILA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have pushed as many as 80 million people in developing Asia into extreme poverty last year, threatening to derail progress on global goals to tackle poverty and hunger by 2030, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday. Developing Asia's extreme poverty rate - or the proportion of its people living on less than $1.90 a day - would have fallen to 2.6% in 2020 from 5.2% in 2017 without COVID-19, but the crisis likely pushed last year's projected rate higher by about 2 percentage points, ADB simulations showed. The figure could even be higher considering the inequalities in areas like health, education and work disruptions that have deepened as the COVID-19 crisis disrupted mobility and stalled economic activity, the ADB said in a flagship report on the region. ""As the socioeconomic impacts of responses to the virus continue to unfold, people already struggling to make ends meet are at risk of tipping over into a life of poverty,"" the Manila-based lender said. Among reporting economies in Asia and the Pacific, which refers to the 46 developing and three developed ADB member economies, only about one in four posted economic growth last year, it said. As unemployment rates increased the region also lost about 8% of work hours, affecting poorer households and workers in the informal sector. The economic damage brought about by the pandemic had further intensified the challenge of meeting global development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015. U.N. members unanimously passed 17 Sustainable Development Goals, known as SDGs, in 2015, creating a blueprint of ambitious tasks from ending hunger and gender inequality to expanding access to education and health care. The goals had a deadline of 2030.

After successfully containing the disease for much of the pandemic, Vietnam has been struggling to control its worst outbreak to date, with a spike in infections and deaths ramping up pressure on authorities to speed up vaccinations. ""Cuba will send a large number of COVID doses and a team to Vietnam to support technology transfer by the end of this year,"" the health ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of doses. Cuba has said its three-shot Abdala vaccine was 92.28% effective against the coronavirus in last-stage clinical trials in June. Vietnam has so far signed deals for recombinant DNA protein and mRNA vaccine technology transfer and is also in talk with U.S. company Pfizer about locating a vaccine plant in the country. The Southeast Asian country has secured more than 23 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and expects to receive at least 50 million doses in the fourth quarter, the health ministry said.

"EXCLUSIVE Abu Dhabi conglomerate IHC eyes deals worth 'a few billion dollars', CEO says",2570,"DUBAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Co (IHC.AD) is considering acquisitions worth a few billion dollars in total across several sectors, including a real estate developer in Abu Dhabi, its chief executive Syed Basar Shueb told Reuters. IHC, now the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse with a market capitalisation of $72 billion, is also considering a 2022 initial public offering (IPO) for its majority-owned healthcare firm Pure Health, Shueb said in an interview. Pure Health has played a pivotal role in screening for COVID-19 infections in the United Arab Emirates. Shueb also said the tightly held conglomerate, active in sectors from food to leisure, is close to acquiring a second-tier Abu Dhabi property developer, which would add to its indirect minority stake in Aldar Properties (ALDAR.AD). He didn't identify any targets, nor specify how much the real estate deal might be worth. ""All the sectors across the nine verticals we are operating (in), we are looking for an acquisition,"" Shueb said. ""There are a few billion dollars of acquisitions we are looking at."" IHC is also looking at three or four targets in the food sector, as well as eyeing targets in the healthcare and leisure and retail sectors, he said. Shueb said the new deals will be funded by bank loans for the first time, while next year the firm plans to issue debut bonds, which would help it secure a credit rating for more transparency. IHC has reported surging earnings over the past year and a half, and its share price has more than tripled this year to 146.1 dirhams, as of Monday's close. In June, it overtook telecommunications firm Etisalat (ETISALAT.AD) as the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse. Its shares are closely held by a group headed by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser and a brother of the country's de facto ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. Royal Group, whose chairman is Sheikh Tahnoun, owns about 74% of IHC. Tahnoun is also chairman of IHC. Shueb said IHC plans to list six companies this year in total, giving domestic investors more opportunities in the Abu Dhabi market. But he said there are no plans to pay dividends. Instead, the aim is for the growth of IHC's operations and investment in its businesses to support a rise in the share price. ""We acquire, restructure, consolidate in our businesses, with diversification and then divestment,"" Shueb said. ($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Risks and rewards: How to bet big on yourself,4150,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - If you had to choose one word to describe the pandemic era, ""risky"" would be a strong candidate. In a deeply risky time for our health, careers and finances, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy has some tips. The former executive of familiar companies like StubHub, Google and Amazon penned a new book ""Choose Possibility: Take Risks and Thrive (Even When You Fail)"" about how to make risk work for you. Cassidy spoke with Reuters about betting big on yourself by opening up new paths and taking your career to the next level. Q: Generally speaking, are people not taking enough risk in their working lives? A: Humans fear failure, fear rejection, and fear looking foolish when trying new things at work. Many of these fears are ego-based: What will others think of us, or what will we think of ourselves if something goes awry? Ego-related risks hold people back in everyday working life. Q: Is now an opportune time for people to take a risk and chart new paths forward? A: COVID has catalyzed many great learnings on risk along with people's desire to change their lives. In the rapid response to the pandemic, we all learned something about our own agility and ability to take risks and make choices quickly, ironically to avoid a bigger danger. That tells us we are each capable of making new choices faster than we think, not only in the face of crisis, but also when times are good. Q: You say that risk-taking is like building up muscles – how so? A: One of the myths I wanted to bust is that some people are born to take risks. In fact, it's the opposite. Anyone can take risks in life – to learn, to discover, to achieve their ambitions. You can find dozens of reasons to take risks, and then take little ones every day. Then you have the benefit of learning from them if they work out. And even if they don't, you have inoculated yourself against the fear of failure. Q: Why can taking multiple risks be a smart strategy? A: People usually want to move serially: Make one choice first and then another. You don't make steady progress that way. But if you pursue multiple risks, magical things start to happen. We diversify our risk, because we aren't betting on only one thing. And you enjoy the benefits of multiple possibilities: Many people don't know what they want, so this way you can try many different things on for size. Q: Is it also risky to not take any risks? A: Yes, because there is the opportunity cost of what you are missing out on. That is actually more of a career threat, if the rest of the world is changing and you are not. Research shows the value of our skills degrades by 50% every five years. Think of it like failing to move on an escalator: If everyone else is moving forward, and you are standing still. Q: Working moms especially are overwhelmed right now, so what career advice would you have for them? A: We often fear the risks of asking for what we need to make something work. This especially applies to women. For instance, when I was running the international business at Google, a year into it I got pregnant. I wanted to keep the job, but we needed to figure out some creative solutions. So, I asked them to pay for a nanny and her travel expenses, which they did. I didn't walk into that discussion entitled, but I did walk in with a track record. Q: Silicon Valley has a reputation of ""tech bro"" culture, so what advice do you have for women about succeeding in that environment? A: Go where your values fit. We all move in environments of bias and prejudice, and it's harder for some people than for others. I've had success in companies with similar values, where I am free to be my full self. If you feel safe, you'll speak up and ask for what you need. Q: Is failure a part of the process? A: This is all about becoming a calculated risk-taker, and that likely means more failure, and also more success. If you are thoughtful about the choices you are making, over the course of your career, that should produce a solid win rate. Then you can reap the rewards of risk, no matter what the outcome of any individual decision. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Biden expected to decide within 24 hours on Afghan evacuation deadline,5615,"KABUL/WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - With thousands of desperate Afghans and foreigners massed at Kabul's airport in the hope of fleeing Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers, U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to decide as soon as Tuesday on whether to extend an Aug. 31 deadline to airlift Americans and their allies to safety. Biden warned on Sunday that the evacuation was going to be ""hard and painful"" and much could still go wrong. U.S. troops might stay beyond an Aug. 31 deadline to oversee the evacuation, he said. On Monday, an administration official told Reuters that Biden would decide within 24 hours whether to extend the timeline to give the Pentagon time to prepare. Beyond the need to remove thousands of Americans, citizens of allied countries and Afghans who worked with U.S. forces, Department of Defense officials said it would still take days to fly out the 6,000 troops deployed to secure and run the airlift. Some Biden advisers were arguing against extending the self-imposed deadline for security reasons. Biden could signal his intentions at a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Tuesday. Two U.S. officials had said the expectation was that the United States would continue evacuations past Aug. 31. A senior State Department official told reporters the country's commitment to at-risk Afghans ""doesn't end on Aug. 31."" Later on Monday, Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told reporters after a briefing on Afghanistan by intelligence officials that he did not believe the evacuation could be completed in the eight remaining days. ""I think it's possible but I think it's very unlikely given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated,"" Schiff said. A Taliban official said foreign forces had not sought an extension and it would not be granted if they had. Washington said negotiations were continuing. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States was in daily talks with the Taliban and making ""enormous progress"" in evacuating Americans and others. Between 3 a.m. and 3 p.m. local time on Monday, some 10,900 people were evacuated from Kabul, meaning the United States had facilitated the removal of 48,000 people since Aug. 14. U.S. defense officials had told Reuters that almost everything would have to go perfectly to extricate every American citizen by Aug. 31, given concerns about reaching the airport, terrorist attacks and complicated processing times. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters the United States had discussed future control of the airport with the Taliban, as well as with U.S. partners and allies.

YES' The Taliban's swift takeover and ensuing chaos in Afghanistan have roiled U.S. politics, with opposition Republicans piling criticism on Biden for the withdrawal, which was initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. Biden's opinion poll numbers have slipped. Biden's fellow Democrats who control Congress have promised to investigate what went wrong in Afghanistan within the past weeks and throughout the 20-year conflict, America's longest war. For its part, the powerful U.S. military has been grappling with the collapse of U.S.-backed Afghan forces after 20 years of training. ""Was it worth it? Yes. Does it still hurt? Yes,"" General David Berger, the commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote in a memo to Marines. The difficulties at the airport were underlined on Monday with a firefight between Afghan guards and unidentified gunmen. German and U.S. forces were also involved, the Germany military said. A local Taliban militant, speaking to a large crowd in Kabul, urged Afghans to remain. ""Where has our honor gone to? Where has our dignity gone to?"" the unidentified militant said. ""We will not let the Americans continue to be here. They will have to leave this place. Whether it is a gun or a pen, we will fight to our last breath."" WORKING WITH ALLIES The Taliban seized power last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after the war launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Panicked Afghans and foreigners have thronged the airport since, clamoring to catch any flight out. Many fear reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law the Taliban enforced while in power from 1996 to 2001. Twenty people have been killed, most in shootings and stampedes, as international forces try to bring order. One member of the Afghan forces was killed and several wounded in Monday's clash, the U.S. military said. A British government spokesperson said British evacuations could not continue once U.S. troops leave. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said more time was needed. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the virtual G7 summit must agree on whether to extend the deadline and how to improve access to the airport. The airport chaos also disrupted aid shipments. The World Health Organization said tons of medical supplies were stuck because Kabul airport was closed to commercial flights. Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government, while their forces focus on the last pockets of opposition.

FDA approves Cara's drug for severe itching in kidney disease patients,1661,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Cara Therapeutics's (CARA.O) drug to treat moderate-to-severe itching in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, making it the first therapy for the ailment in the United States. The company expects to commercially launch the injection, Korsuva, in the first quarter of 2022, Chief Executive Officer Derek Chalmers said in an interview. The drug is designed to be administered three times a week after each dialysis. It reduces the activity of the sensory nerve that relays itching from the skin to the spinal cord and subsequently to the brain. Chronic kidney disease patients with severe itching currently take depressants such as barbiturates and allergy medication antihistamines. Cara's shares were unchanged after the bell, having gained about 4% in regular trading on Monday. The company has an exclusive license agreement with Switzerland-based Vifor Pharma for Korsuva, under which it would earn 60% of the profit on U.S. sales. Cara said it could price the drug similar to the $17,000 annual cost of Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) treatment Parsabiv, which treats secondary hyperparathyroidism, or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, in kidney disease patients. Jefferies analyst Christopher Howerton estimates Korsuva will generate peak sales of about $900 million in 2030. Cara has also filed for marketing approval with the European Medicines Agency, whose decision is due in the second quarter of 2022. It is also developing an oral form of Korsuva in five different conditions, including atopic dermatitis. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Thailand to receive 61 mln doses of AstraZeneca vaccine this year,1819,"BANGKOK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Thailand will receive 61 million doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine this year, a government spokesperson said on Monday, as the Southeast Asian country rushes to vaccinate its population amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Thailand is AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing hub for the region, but has been slow to obtain enough shots to inoculate its population. About 9% of Thailand's 66 million people have been fully vaccinated. ""This is good news, it will help create herd immunity faster. This will take pressure off the health care system, help people return to their normal lives and speed up economic recovery,"" government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said in a statement. Last month, health officials said that AstraZeneca had asked to delay deliveries of its order of 61 million doses to May 2022. read more The news that the doses would arrive sooner than expected followed a meeting between Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, and AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot, Anucha Burapachaisri said. The delivery would bring Thailand's total vaccine supply for 2021 to over 120 million doses, of which 61 million from AstraZeneca and a combination of 30 million doses of China's Sinovac and 30 million from Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE). Thailand will buy an additional 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine next year, Anucha added. Thailand has reported 1,066,786 coronavirus infections and 9,562 deaths since the pandemic began.

Researchers seek powerful antibody against many variants; breakthrough cases may be less infectious,3997,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Here is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Researchers working toward one vaccine for many variants Two separate research teams last week reported on laboratory tests of monoclonal antibodies that appear to protect against a broad range of COVID-19 virus variants. One study, published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, identified ""high-level, broad-spectrum"" antibodies in blood samples from survivors of the original SARS outbreak in 2003 who recently received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In test tube experiments, some of the SARS survivors' antibodies induced by the vaccine could neutralize not only all of the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, but also five viruses that have been identified in bats and pangolins and that have the potential to cause human infection. In a separate study, published on Thursday in the journal Immunity, another research team describes an antibody that was highly protective at low doses against a wide range of COVID-19-causing variants in mice. ""The antibody attaches to a part of the virus that differs little across the variants, meaning that it is unlikely for resistance to arise at this spot,"" the authors said. The findings from these studies could be a step toward developing new antibodies that would be effective against multiple different coronaviruses, the two teams say. Infectious virus shedding may be lower in breakthrough cases Vaccinated people who get infected with COVID-19 have high levels of the virus in their noses and throats but not all of that virus is infectious, a new study suggests. Among 24,706 vaccinated healthcare workers in The Netherlands, 161 developed mild or asymptomatic breakthrough infections, mostly due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The viral levels on nose-and-throat swab samples from these patients were just as high as in unvaccinated healthcare workers who were infected last year with the original strain of the virus. But in test tube experiments, the virus from vaccinated patients was less efficient at reproducing itself than virus from unvaccinated patients, probably because some of it had been neutralized by antibodies from the vaccine, the researchers speculate. In a report posted on medRxiv on Saturday ahead of peer review, they conclude that shedding of infectious virus is reduced in breakthrough cases, although patients are still contagious. Antibodies fade faster after vaccine vs actual infection Protective antibody levels decline faster in recipients of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech than in COVID-19 survivors, according to doctors at one of Israel's largest HMOs. They tracked antibody levels in 2,653 adults who received two doses of the vaccine and in 4,361 COVID-19 survivors who were never vaccinated. Antibody levels fell by up to 40% per month in vaccinated participants, versus less than 5% per month in so-called convalescents. After six months, about 84% of vaccine recipients still had detectable antibodies, whereas roughly 90% of convalescents still had detectable antibodies after nine months. Dr. Ariel Israel of Leumit Health Services, coauthor of a reported posted on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, noted that antibodies are not the immune system's only weapon against the virus. Still, he said, the data suggests that antibody protection in Pfizer vaccine recipients wanes at a higher rate than in COVID-19 survivors. Leumit researchers had previously reported that breakthrough infection rates increase starting about five months after vaccination. Dr. Israel said the combined data argues for a booster shot five months after the second injection, especially for high-risk individuals. Click for a Reuters graphic on vaccines in development.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - Lawyers for Illumina Inc are set to defend the life sciences company's $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, as European antitrust regulators assail the company for closing the deal without first securing regulatory approval. D. Michael Chappell, chief administrative law judge at the FTC, is presiding over the trial, which could run until early October. He met virtually with the lawyers in the case on Monday for more than an hour to set the contours and expectations of the trial. The companies closed their deal last week, despite the FTC's challenge to San Diego, California-based Illumina's tie-up with the cancer-detection test maker and an EU probe that opened in June. EU officials said on Friday they ""deeply regret"" Illumina's decision to move ahead while its investigation was still ongoing. The FTC has not commented. Illumina said last week there was no ""legal impediment"" to closing the deal and that it would hold Grail as a separate company amid European Commission review. Grail, based in Menlo Park, California, relies on Illumina's DNA sequencing technology for its tests. FTC lawyers, in the agency's challenge lodged in March, asserted the combination of the companies would hurt test-detection innovation and drive up prices. Illumina's chief executive saidat the time that the acquisition ""provides huge benefits to people who may have cancer and don't know it."" Cravath, Swaine & Moore litigation partner David Marriott is set to deliver the opening for Illumina, and Latham & Watkins partner Al Pfeiffer, a former co-chairman of the firm's antitrust practice, is prepared to speak for Grail. The Cravath team includes Christine Varney, a former Obama-era head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Marriott and Pfeiffer did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Monday. Crowell & Moring antitrust partner Alexis Gilman in Washington said the case is being closely watched as ""the first vertical merger case that the FTC has litigated in decades."" The parties, he said, had offered ""fairly robust commitments to address potential concerns,"" including an effort to hold and lower prices on sequencing products. Each side will get up to two hours to make an opening statement. ""Two hours is a limit, not a goal,"" Chappell said on Monday. Chappell also warned that ""expert witnesses are not allowed to run wild in this courtroom."" FTC senior trial counsel Susan Musser, who joined the agency in May 2020 from Hogan Lovells, where she was an associate, is set to deliver the government's opening statement. A handful of Big Law firms are representing non-party clients that provided documents in response to subpoenas issued earlier in the case, according to filings in recent weeks that sought some protection for featuring confidential or proprietary information.

Fed's Jackson Hole shift shows Delta variant's ability to skew plans,4205,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Health officials in Teton County, Wyoming, announced last Thursday what was in part an administrative change, swapping a local five-point index for assessing COVID-19 risk for a four-point scale used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that change promptly pushed the county into the CDC's highest risk category, and shifted the Federal Reserve's plans to hold its Jackson Hole central banking conference as an in-person event into non-compliance with local health guidance. Within a day, the U.S. central bank had cancelled the in-person portion of the conference at the local mountain resort. The annual symposium, organized by the Kansas City Fed, will still take place online and the substance will be the same. Academic research papers will be presented and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a speech via webcast on Friday. Yet the sequence of events last week shows the day-to-day recalibration underway over what is and isn't safe during the current U.S. COVID-19 surge, which is being fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus. The Fed's reaction to a county government's communication choices served as a high-profile example of how the pace of the economic recovery is being reshaped. The decision certainly diminished public health risks. The guest list for the Fed's Jackson Hole event had already been pared perhaps by half from a typical year's crowd of around 150, COVID-19 vaccination was mandatory, and masks required indoors. The cancellation further eliminated travel and two days of in-person sessions, meals and receptions, as well as a typically large slate of sidebar meetings. It also meant dozens of canceled plane trips, rental cars and hotel rooms for the attendees, their family members or guests, an entourage of press, and others, and refunds of the $1,100 conference fee. That occurred even though nothing much had changed between the start of the week, when Fed officials were nailing down last-minute plans, and late Friday afternoon, when Kansas City Fed officials called off the in-person gathering ""due to the recently elevated COVID-19 health risk level in Teton County, Wyoming."" Per capita case rates had continued upward, but a dramatic spike in Teton County infections had begun in mid-July and was well underway by the start of August. What was different was the scale used by county officials to assess the risk. In the CDC's streamlined index, Teton County was now at the red, or highest, level. In fact, the Atlanta-based health agency moved the county's risk level to ""high"" on July 22, according to its online data for Teton County. The local guidance for that risk level discouraged gatherings outside of immediate family members. 'LOT OF CANCELLATIONS' The Kansas City Fed had said in May, when it announced it was returning to an in-person conference after moving the annual gathering online last year, that it would ""adhere to all health and safety guidelines that are in place at the time of the program."" A Kansas city Fed official said the regional bank has been monitoring the Teton County health department's website and made the decision to announce the shift after the close of markets on Friday based on the change of status. Under the county's prior index, which included a broader set of considerations such as hospital admissions, supplies of protective equipment, and the availability of testing, the risk level also would have been changed last week from moderate to high, said Jodie Pond, the county's health director. The local guidance for that risk level under the prior system, however, did not recommend family-only gatherings, a suggestion reserved for the county's highest ""critical"" risk stage. ""There have been a lot of cancellations of events and that was not our goal, to cancel events if they could be done safely,"" Pond said of the recent change. ""I don't want to second-guess an event organizer because I am always going to err on the side of canceling, to err on the side of caution ... I would say it is probably okay - nobody asked us - if people were masked indoors and required to be vaccinated."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
ADA suit over MTA elevator-outages back on track – 2nd Circuit,4292,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - New York City subway riders with disabilities won another chance to show that peak-hour elevator breakdowns at high-volume stations deprive them of meaningful access to the transportation system, thanks to a federal appeals court decision Monday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated a certified class action filed in 2017 by lawyers at Disability Rights Advocates and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton on behalf of three individuals and six nonprofit organizations, who say the system is shirking its duty to perform regular maintenance on the elevators. A lower court granted summary judgment for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York City Transit Authority (referred to collectively as MTA), represented by Hoguet Newman Regal & Kenney, based on MTA’s undisputed evidence that, system-wide, elevators at ADA-accessible stations were operational at least 96.5 percent of the time. However, “averages can obscure variables,” and the plaintiffs had raised “a reasonable inference that, for some, access is not meaningful (assuming no accommodations),” Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote for the 2nd Circuit. The plaintiffs’ evidence showed an outage rate of 8 percent to 15 percent at high-volume stations during peak hours; and, since getting to the desired platform can require up to four elevator rides, a daily commuter’s chance of encountering an “out-of-service” sign could be 50 percent or more. The district court “erred by declining to separately consider such riders,” Jacobs wrote, joined by Circuit Judges Jose Cabranes and Steven Menashi. Counsel for the transit authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Emily Seelenfreund of Disability Rights Advocates said her clients “appreciate the recognition … that the ‘meaningful access’ inquiry demands an examination of the impact of outages on real people's travel in the context of the system as a whole, as well as looking at the accommodations available during these frequent, unplanned outages.” While fewer than one-fourth of the MTA’s 472 stations are ADA-accessible, the elevator-outage lawsuit concerns only those that are. The plaintiffs are a class led by Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, Chris Pangilinan and Dustin Jones, and nonprofits Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled; Bronx Independent Living Services; Harlem Independent Living Center; Center for Independence of the Disabled; Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York; and New York Statewide Senior Action Council. They alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the New York City Human Rights Law. They drew amicus support from The National Disability Rights Network, TransitCenter, and Up-Stand. On remand, the MTA can still prevail if it establishes that it offers reasonable accommodations to riders with disabilities when elevator outages prevent them from accessing their trains. Both sides had offered evidence about accommodations, with the MTA relying primarily on its extensive and fully accessible bus-service network. U.S. District Judge George Daniels had questioned whether a bus could be viewed as an “accommodation” for a subway train; however, he found it unnecessary to decide because he found no denial of subway service. The 2nd Circuit said a bus is “an” accommodation - since, like the subway, “it is a means of getting from here to there” – but said the question of whether bus service is a reasonable accommodation is a factual question to be decided on remand. The case is Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled et al. v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City Transit Authority et al., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1433.

Purdue Pharma judge says Sacklers face 'substantial risk' of liability,2458,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy said on Monday that some members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker face a “substantial risk” of liability and could be on the hook for ""huge amounts of money"" over claims the company fueled the opioid epidemic. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made the remark during closing arguments in a trial over Purdue’s proposed reorganization plan. ""I think there is substantial risk that the Sacklers, or some of them, could be liable for huge amounts of money,"" said Drain, who added that “the question is where you draw the line.” Under the deal, which Purdue says is worth more than $10 billion, the Sacklers would contribute about $4.5 billion and receive legal protections against future opioid-related litigation. Drain did not explicitly state which way he will rule but suggested he finds the deal was sufficient. But he urged lawyers for the Sacklers and the nine states that oppose the deal to continue settlement talks over next couple of days. More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drain told Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Fogelman that it would be ""boneheaded"" to reject billions of dollars from the Sacklers just because it is not enough to solve the entire U.S. opioid crisis. The judge is expected to issue a formal ruling on the deal this week. The money would go toward various entities and private individuals with opioid claims, as well as state and local opioid abatement programs. Critics of the settlement argue that the liability releases are too broad. An attorney representing the states of Washington and Oregon, which oppose the plan, told Drain on Monday that approving the deal would be a “historic mistake.” The judge also stated that appeals courts generally support the types of releases the Sacklers would receive if they meet certain standards. At the outset of Monday’s hearing, a lawyer for the Sacklers said they had agreed to narrow the litigation releases to exclude protections for the family against non-opioid-related claims. But the crux of the releases, shielding the Sacklers against opioid-related litigation, remains intact. During testimony last week, members of the Sackler family said they would not contribute if they do not receive the releases. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. energy firms launching employee COVID-19 vaccination mandates,2509,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies are moving to require that employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations as infection rates rise across the United States and health surveys show that energy workers remain among those most reluctant to get inoculations. Calls to require vaccinations for employees working at close quarters in oilfield and refinery operations came as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. read more The second-largest U.S. oil producer, Chevron Corp (CVX.N), and refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) will require jabs for certain field workers or new workers, while leading Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) is requiring newly hired employees to be fully vaccinated before their first day of work, according to a job posting. A spokesperson for Pioneer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger (SLB.N) said last week some customers were requesting that its staff be vaccinated or tested before arriving on job sites. ""We continuously review our internal policies and procedures to ensure that we can meet our customers’ needs while prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees,"" a Schlumberger spokeswoman said in an email. This month, San Antonio-based Valero became the first U.S. refiner to require vaccinations as a condition of employment for new workers at Texas and Louisiana refineries. Oil producer Hess (HES.N) said it will require workers at U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1. In a statement, the company pointed to the ""highly infectious nature"" of the Delta variant and rising number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Energy and construction workers have some of the lowest vaccine uptake rates, according to an online survey led by Wendy King, an associate epidemiology professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. Some 45% of extraction and construction workers said they were hesitant to get the vaccine, versus just 7.3% in the computer and mathematical professions, the May survey showed. Chevron's mandate will cover offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico, some onshore support staff, expatriates and employees who travel internationally, a spokeswoman said in an email. This month, Chevron postponed a full return of office employees in California and Texas because of a resurgence in cases related to the Delta variant. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

""That tells me the fundamentals are in place,"" Cardillo added. ""There’s worries out there, but it’s hard to keep this market down."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech in a move that could accelerate inoculations in the United States. ""Full approval means that there’s most likely going to be more mandates, more companies will mandate that you have to get the vaccine in order to get back to the office,"" Cardillo said. ""I don’t think this will get all the doubters vaccinated but this news today will probably drive (the vaccinated rate) closer to 75%."" Pfizer and U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech advanced 2.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Rival Moderna Inc gained 7.5%.

Earlier this month, New York City required proof of COVID-19 vaccination at restaurants, gyms and other businesses. The mandate sparked backlash from some business owners and residents who sued de Blasio. The latest mandate also could face resistance from unions representing New York City teachers and staff. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), said the union's priority was to keep children safe and school open. But he added in a statement that ""there are many implementation details, including provisions for medical exceptions, that by law must be negotiated with the UFT and other unions, and if necessary, resolved by arbitration."" Meisha Porter, chancellor of New York City's public schools, said at least 63% of employees were already vaccinated against COVID-19. Efforts to increase vaccination rates and implement public safety measures like mask wearing in schools have faced staunch opposition in some parts of the country, especially in some Southern states that have been hard hit by the Delta variant. In Florida, some school districts now face the potential loss of some public funding because they mandated masks in defiance of a ban on that step by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is another Republican who has acted to block local officials from mandating face coverings. He was dealt a setback late last week when the state's Supreme Court temporarily allowed schools to keep mask mandates in place. read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
U.S. report finds multiple problems with Keystone pipeline,2539,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog found multiple problems with the construction, manufacture and design of the Keystone pipeline, validating President Joe Biden's decision to revoke the permit for a Keystone XL extension, leaders of several House Democratic committees said on Monday. The lawmakers requested the Government Accountability Office report in November 2019 after more than 11,000 barrels of oil leaked from the pipeline system in two releases in less than two years. ""GAO found that preventable construction issues contributed to the current Keystone pipeline’s spills more frequently than the industry-wide trends,"" they said in a statement. Keystone's four largest spills were ""caused by issues related to the original design, manufacturing of the pipe, or construction of the pipeline,"" the GAO report said. Biden canceled Keystone XL's permit on his first day in office on Jan. 20, dealing a death blow to a project that would have carried 830,000 barrels per day of heavy oil sands crude from Alberta to Nebraska. L1N2JX1D8 ""TC Energy’s record among its peers is one of the worst in terms of volume of oil spilled per mile transported,"" a statement from the lawmakers said. The lawmakers included Representative Frank Pallone, energy and commerce committee chair. TC Energy Corp (TRP.TO) officially canceled the $9 billion Keystone XL in June. It filed a notice of intent in July to begin a legacy North American Free Trade Agreement claim and is seeking more than $15 billion in damages from the U.S. government. The company said in response to the report it has had ""zero high-impact incidents in 18 months,"" after taking measures to strengthen safety and prevent incidents. Pipeline opponents want to slow the movement of Canadian oil to the United States. But pipeline supporters say it will be shipped anyway and that oil sent by rail has caused numerous fiery accidents. Biden ""was clearly right to question this operator’s ability to construct a safe and resilient pipeline, and we support his decision to put Americans’ health and environment above industry interests,” the U.S. representatives said.

"Canada's British Columbia plans vaccine passport for restaurants, sports events",1932,"VANCOUVER, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Canadian province of British Columbia will require patrons of non-essential businesses such as restaurants and movie theatres to be vaccinated against COVID-19 from Sept. 13, the government said on Monday. The vaccine requirement will also cover fitness studios along with sporting events, concerts, weddings and other private and public indoor social events, health officials said. British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, is reporting some of the country's highest rates of new COVID-19 cases per capita and recently mandated vaccines for staff of long-term care homes. The province reported 663 new cases on Friday, the most recent data available. read more People wanting to enter a non-essential business must have at least one dose of vaccine starting Sept. 13 and both doses by Oct. 24, Premier John Horgan said. ""There's no reason those who are anxious to participate in the social and economic life of our community can't take that next step and get that safe, effective vaccine,"" Horgan told reporters. Quebec was the first province to bring in vaccine passports for non-essential businesses earlier in August. Vaccine mandates are becoming an election issue in Canada's ongoing federal election, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered on Aug. 15. Trudeau's centre-left Liberal party brought in mandatory vaccines for federal workers before the election was called and has supported calls for further mandates, as have the left-leaning New Democrats. Canada's Conservative party has said such mandates would impede individual freedom. read more Currently, 73% of Canadians aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated, according to government data.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine gains full U.S. regulatory approval,4956,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc(PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine - the first to secure such Food and Drug Administration validation - prompting President Joe Biden to make a fresh pitch to vaccine skeptics to get the shot to fight the relentless pandemic. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review. Public health officials hope the action will convince unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. Speaking at the White House, Biden called the FDA approval ""an important moment in our fight against the pandemic"" and urged more private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated. ""If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened,"" Biden said. ""It's time for you to go get your vaccination. Get it today,"" Biden added. ""... There is no time to waste."" The Pentagon said it is preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for military personnel. U.S. health officials expect that the FDA's action also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. New York City said it will require vaccines for public-school teachers, while New Jersey announced that all state workers must get vaccinated by mid-October or agree to regular COVID-19 tests. ""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated,"" said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner. More than 204 million people in the United States have received the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA's approval extends the shelf life of Pfizer shots from six months to nine months. It also confirms that the vaccine increases risk of heart inflammation, particularly among young men in the week following their second shot. The approval makes it easier for doctors to prescribe a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine off-label for people who may benefit from additional protection against COVID-19. Pfizer shares closed up around 2.5% and BioNTech shares gained more than 9.5%. The two other COVID-19 vaccines given emergency-use authorization - made by Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) - have not yet received full FDA approval. The FDA gave emergency-use authorization to Pfizer's vaccine for people age 16 and older in December - the first shot to gain such backing in the United States - and provided further emergency-use authorization for people age 12 and up in May. SHOTS FOR CHILDREN Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to apply for full approval in children ages 12 to 15 as soon as required data is available. Woodcock said the FDA is not recommending that children under age 12 get the vaccine now because it needs to ensure it is safe for them, telling reporters it ""would be a great concern if people vaccinate children because we don't have the proper data."" Pfizer is expected to submit data this fall to support the shot's emergency-use authorization for children under 12 based on smaller doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics, representing children's doctors, discouraged having children under 12 receive the vaccine. Pfizer's shot has received conditional regulatory approval elsewhere including Britain and the European Union. The United States leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. More than 625,000 Americans have died, including an average of more than 600 daily in recent weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71% of Americans age 12 and older - the population eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines - have gotten at least one dose and 60.2% are fully vaccinated. For the entire population, including children up to age 11 for whom no vaccines are yet approved, 60.7% of Americans have received at least one dose, with 51.5% fully vaccinated. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement the FDA's approval ""affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed."" In Pfizer's clinical trial, approximately 12,000 recipients of the vaccine have been followed for at least six months. The vaccine will now be marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA on Aug. 13 authorized a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer's shot has not yet been authorized for more widespread use as a booster. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Biden administration defends eviction ban at U.S. Supreme Court,1386,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to leave in place a COVID-19 pandemic-related federal ban on residential evictions while the justices consider a challenge by landlord groups to the ban's legality. In a court filing, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acted within its lawful authority this month when it renewed the moratorium through Oct. 3 after it had lapsed at the end of July. Groups representing landlords have sought to lift the moratorium, pointing out that even Biden administration officials have conceded it may not be lawful. The CDC first issued an eviction moratorium in September 2020, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic. Realtor groups in Alabama and Georgia were among those challenging the moratorium. Under heavy political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration on Aug. 3 issued a slightly narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Biden initially had said that congressional action was needed to renew the moratorium, but his administration reversed course. The current moratorium, due to expire in October, covers nearly 92% of U.S. counties, but that could change based on COVID-19 conditions."
U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocks reinstatement of Trump-era immigration policy,2386,"WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A U.S. Supreme Court justice on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would require Democratic President Joe Biden to reinstate a contentious immigration policy implemented by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. The brief order by conservative Justice Samuel Alito puts the litigation on hold while the high court considers how to handle the Biden administration's request seeking to impose a longer-term block on the judge's ruling that would require the government to revive the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. The Biden administration turned to the Supreme Court after the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late on Thursday denied a government request to delay the effective date of the lower court judge's ruling a week earlier. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ""requires the government to abruptly reinstate a broad and controversial immigration enforcement program that has been formally suspended for seven months and largely dormant for nearly nine months before that,"" Acting Solicitor General Brian Fletcher wrote in papers to the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Trump. The Justice Department wants the court to act immediately, with the judge's injunction due to go into effect on Saturday. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized MPP, informally known as ""remain in Mexico,"" saying it subjected mostly Central American migrants to unsanitary conditions and violence. Arrests of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border have reached 20-year highs in recent months, a trend Republicans pin on Biden's reversal of MPP and other hardline Trump immigration policies. The Biden administration has left in place a Trump-era health order that allows border authorities to expel migrants to Mexico without the chance to seek asylum in the United States. The ruling by the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit said the Biden administration must implement the MPP program in ""good faith,"" which appears to leave the government some discretion in how to move forward. Roberto Velasco, a senior Mexican foreign ministry official responsible for North American relations, said Mexico had not yet received any notification from the U.S. government about the ruling.

Germany drops incidence levels as key COVID yardstick,1704,"BERLIN, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Germany has decided to stop using the coronavirus infection rate as its yardstick for deciding if restrictions should be in force to contain the spread of the virus, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. The seven-day incidence rate was a key measure in determining whether restrictions could be imposed or lifted, with infection thresholds of 35, 50 and 100 per 100,000 people triggering the opening or closure of different parts of society. But as the number of people who are fully vaccinated rises, calls have grown for the incidence rate to be dropped as a measure to determine whether lockdowns are necessary. ""We decided today that we no longer need comprehensive protective measures when the number of cases or incidence is 50, because a large proportion of the people are vaccinated,"" Merkel said. The government and federal states will instead monitor hospitalisations as a key indicator for whether the health system is becoming overburdened, Merkel said. Merkel added Berlin would discuss how to define the new measure in talks in the coming weeks with the 16 state premiers, who are in charge of health policies. Germany reported 3,668 new coronavirus infections on Monday and a seven-day incidence rate of 56.4, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. Some 59% of the population are full-vaccinated with around 64% having received at least one dose. Merkel said more Germans should get vaccinated now to protect the health system from being overwhelmed during a possible fourth wave of infections later in the year. ""Our vaccination rate is not high enough yet,"" the chancellor said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Why ASU can’t block ‘odious’ anti-mask Instagrammer who touted ‘Hoax-19’ parties,7615,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. Sometimes, even vulgar, anonymous bullies who claim COVID is a hoax and casually compare mask mandates to Nazism deserve to win. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Phoenix denied a default judgment motion by the board of regents for Arizona State University. ASU wanted a permanent injunction to bar an Instagram account called asu_covid.parties from using the university's trademarks or school colors in posts encouraging ASU students to attend mask-less “COVID parties."" U.S. District Judge Dominic Lanza said he understood that ASU was trying to combat the pandemic when it brought trademark claims against the anonymous Instagrammer, who claimed to be an ASU student and displayed ASU’s logo in a post proclaiming, “No more social distancing. No more masks. It is time to party.” But Lanza said the university’s novel use of trademark law wasn’t the right means to that end. ASU alleged that the anonymous Instagrammer, called John Doe in its complaint, was abusing its trademarks to sow confusion and conflict about the school's COVID policies. The judge said those claims didn’t hold up because no reasonable person would be deceived by Doe’s use of the university’s logo and school colors. Doe’s language – his first post promised, “We about to get fucking lit,” for instance – belied any official affiliation with the school, the judge said. And Doe’s posts relentlessly criticized ASU's masking and social distancing policies – hardly a stance that would be taken by an official ASU account. Doe even referred more than once to ASU president Michael Crow as ""Fuhrer."" “Many things can be said about these offensive and outrageous statements,” Lanza wrote, “but it is not plausible (to put it mildly) that a reasonably prudent consumer would believe ASU was the source or origin of them.” I doubt Lanza’s decision will have much practical effect. Instagram’s parent, Facebook, Inc, agreed to block the Doe’s asu_covid.parties account after ASU named the company in its initial complaint. (The university dropped Facebook as a defendant after the shutdown.) Doe subsequently tried to launch a new account, asu_covid.parties2, but, according to an ASU filing, Facebook disabled that one as well. It appears that Instagram is no longer an outlet for Doe. It's nevertheless worth crediting Lanza for the careful consideration he gave to ASU’s claims. It would have been easy, after all, for the judge simply to side with ASU against a defendant he considered to be a “deeply unsympathetic” author of “odious” posts. Doe’s conduct in the litigation certainly didn’t curry favor with the judge. ASU filed its initial complaint in August 2020. A few days later, Doe sent an email to ASU counsel Glenn Bacal and Sean Garrison of Bacal & Garrison Law Group. “I heard in the news that you guys are trying to sue me,” the profanity-laced email said. “Withdraw your complaint or I will file a Rule 11 motion for sanctions....I am extremely experienced and outrageously vexatious.” Doe actually showed up in the docket with an answer to ASU’s complaint and a request to use the court’s electronic filing system. (Doe supplied only an email address but said, “I have used ECF filing many, many times before and know how it works.”) The filing was rife with insults for ASU’s lawyers and Nazi references for ASU officials. More substantively, though, Doe claimed First Amendment protection for the Instagram account. The posts were “clearly a parody,” Doe said. “The 1st Amendment allows me to be as offensive as I want to be. So suck it!"" Some of Doe’s posts do have a satiric tinge, like the post claiming that a big unmasked party for ASU students would be hosted at the consulate of Belarus so it couldn’t be shut down by police; and the post thanking Israel and Teva Pharmaceuticals for agreeing to use proceeds of the party to distribute “hydrochloroquine” around the world. Others, though, just seem angry, like Doe’s penultimate post: “No working out without a mask even though that’s more likely to hurt you than the chance of catching COVID-19. No frat parties. No Trump rallies but protesting BLM is okay. No singing in church. No clubbing.’ Fuck Führer Crow. We are going to party.” Whatever Doe’s intent, Lanza struck the answer to ASU’s complaint because it was “filled with obscenities, inflammatory language and insults directed toward ASU and its counsel.” The judge ordered Doe to file a revised response without curse words and gratuitous vituperation. He also instructed Doe to file a motion explaining why he or she is entitled to continue litigating anonymously. (Doe’s answer cited the First Amendment but Lanza said that was an insufficient justification.) Doe never made another filing in the case. (It’s ironic, in a way, that a purported anti-mask advocate would refuse to remove the electronic mask hiding his or her true identity.) Lanza granted ASU’s motion for discovery to find out who Doe is, but the university’s motion last April for a default judgment, which outlined why such judgments can be entered against anonymous defendants, implied that Doe’s identity remains unknown. I sent an email to the address Doe listed in the ECF application but did not receive a response. In an emailed statement, the university said it disagreed with Lanza's conclusion but appreciated his recognition of Doe's ""odious"" behavior. ""ASU’s concern for the health of its students and the greater university community necessitated this lawsuit,"" the statement said. ""As a practical matter, the university achieved its primary objective -- the offending Instagram account was shut down just as soon as the lawsuit was filed, preventing any further possible confusion among the university community and the general public about whether ASU sponsored or otherwise condoned such reckless behavior as Covid parties."" I am certain that Doe never actually held a party for ASU students at the Belarusian consulate in Arizona, since, among other things, there is no Belarusian consulate in Arizona. Doe's Instagram account was still a headache for ASU. Doe may have intended asu_covid.parties to be satiric – if you give Doe the benefit of very serious doubts on that point – but lots of people who read Doe’s posts didn’t get the joke. You can understand why ASU resorted to a trademark claim to shut Doe down. But as I said above, sometimes the most obnoxious litigants still deserve to win, even if they don’t even bother to show up.

QUOTEBOX Reactions to U.S. FDA's full approval of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,3921,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE became the first to secure full approval from the U.S Food and Drug Administration on Monday, a move that is expected to help health authorities struggling to win over vaccine skeptics. read more Following are a few comments from the President of the United States and public health experts: U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (on Twitter) ""The FDA has officially approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. While all three COVID vaccines have met FDA's strict standards for emergency use, this FDA approval should give added confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective."" ""If you're not vaccinated yet, now is the time."" BARBARA ALEXANDER, PRESIDENT, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA ""Full FDA approval strengthens the case for vaccination requirements as an important strategy to curb infection and prevent hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. The most important takeaway from today's announcement is to get vaccinated."" JESSE GOODMAN, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY & FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIST AT FDA ""I know some people are concerned that vaccines, including this one, can have adverse effects. What FDA is really saying is that the benefits far outweigh any risks."" ""The approval also allows doctors to legally prescribe additional doses of the vaccine to their patients, which some doctors have already been doing."" ""Some of these prescribing decisions may be appropriate, but I think it is really incumbent upon the FDA and the CDC and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to provide really good and strong guidelines while we're still learning more about things like combinations of different vaccines."" ERIC TOPOL, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR OF THE SCRIPPS RESEARCH TRANSLATIONAL INSTITUTE ""Some companies, the military and some health systems did go ahead with mandates, but not nearly as many as will go forward now. Many large employers will go ahead and require vaccination because they were waiting for the magic word of full approval instead of emergency use authorization."" ""It will help many who are hesitant. Obviously, there was a large proportion of Americans who were concerned when it was viewed as an emergency, rather than a fully blessed, sanctioned, approved vaccine. I think that at both levels, there will be a surge of vaccinations in the weeks ahead."" AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ""While this (the approval for use in people aged 16 and above) means it is legally permissible for physicians to administer the vaccine off-label for children aged 11 and younger, who currently have no available vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly discourages that practice."" ""The clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 11 years old and younger are underway, and we need to see the data from those studies before we give this vaccine to younger children"" AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ""Today's news marks a critical moment for people who were concerned about getting vaccinated due to the vaccines being authorized for emergency use. FDA approval also should further reinforce efforts in the health care field to urge vaccination, and to deploy all reasonable tools to achieve high levels of vaccination, including mandatory vaccination policies"" PAUL OFFIT, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, MEMBER OF FDA'S VACCINE ADVISORY PANEL ""What the FDA has now said is that the vaccine that they have basically licensed not just the product, but also the manufacturing site and the process by which the product is made.""

France's COVID-19 hospitalisations highest in 2 months,1428,"PARIS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - French health authorities said on Monday the number of people hospitalised for COVID-19 and those treated in intensive care units (ICU) stood at the highest levels in more than two months, as the Delta variant of the disease has put a renewed strain on the health system. The daily new infections increased by 5,166 over 24 hours, but were down by 11.4% versus last Monday. And the seven-day moving average of daily additional cases decreased to 21,130 versus 23,783 10 days ago. ""Regarding ICU patients, the peak of this fourth wave could be reached in the days to come"", Health Minister Olivier Veran told BFM, adding he remained wary of a possible back-to-school effect in a week's time. He also said France's main independent health authority would soon recommend a third COVID-19 for those older than 65 years. The number of people hospitalised for the virus rose by 356 over 24 hours to 11,007, the first time the figure exceeded 11,000 since June 17. Patients treated in intensive care units for the disease increased by 87 to 2,215, the highest since June 10. The COVID-19 death toll went up by 108, at 113,496 - the 11th-highest in the world - with the seven day moving average at an almost three-months high of 109. At more than 6.6 million cases since the outbreak of the disease, France has the fifth-highest total of infection globally. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pentagon set to make Pfizer vaccine mandatory after FDA approval,2342,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Pentagon is preparing to issue updated guidance to require all U.S. service personnel to be vaccinated after Monday's approval of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. Kirby told a briefing the completion date for vaccine guidance was still being worked on. The FDA granted full approval on Monday to the vaccine, which had earned emergency-use authorization in December, making it the first to secure such validation as U.S. health authorities struggle to win over vaccine skeptics. Asked if similar guidance could be given for other COVID-19 vaccines, Kirby replied: ""Right now we're focused on the Pfizer vaccine because of the FDA approval that came in this morning."" The Pentagon said this month it would seek President Joe Biden's approval by mid-September to require 1.3 million military members to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A syringe is filled with a dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine at a pop-up community vaccination center at the Gateway World Christian Center in Valley Stream, New York, U.S., February 23, 2021. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo After setting COVID-19 rules for federal workers, Biden last month directed the Pentagon to look into ""how and when"" it would require members of the military to take the vaccine. Biden said then he strongly supported the Pentagon's plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for service members by mid-September. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the deadline could be moved up if the FDA approved the vaccine earlier. The U.S. military said this month that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members. Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. About 73% of sailors are fully vaccinated, compared with the U.S. national average of about 60% of adults ages 18 and over. Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19 - just 28 in total, according to Pentagon data.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine making it the first to secure such Food and Drug Administration validation as health authorities struggle to win over vaccine skeptics during a relentless pandemic. The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, went a step further based on updated data from the company's clinical trial and fully approved it for use in people age 16 and older. Public health officials hope the action will convince unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective. There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. ""This FDA approval should give added confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective,"" President Joe Biden, who has sought to increase vaccination levels, wrote on Twitter. Shortly after the FDA's announcement, the Pentagon said it is preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for U.S. military personnel. U.S. health officials expect that the FDA's full approval also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. ""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated,"" said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner. More than 204 million people in the United States have received the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA's approval extends the shelf life of Pfizer shots from six months to nine months. It also confirms that the vaccine increases risk of heart inflammation, particularly among young men in the week following their second shot. The approval also makes it easier for physicians to prescribe a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine off-label for people who may benefit from additional protection against COVID-19. The FDA gave emergency-use authorization to the vaccine for people age 16 and older in December - making it the first shot to gain such backing in the United States - and then gave further emergency-use authorization for people age 12 and up in May. The FDA is awaiting additional data before deciding on fully approving Pfizer's vaccine in children ages 12 to 15. Woodcock said the FDA was not recommending children below 12 years of age get the vaccine at this time, with more data needed to ensure it is safe for them, telling reporters it ""would be a great concern if people vaccinate children because we don't have the proper data."" Pfizer is expected to submit data this fall to support the shot's emergency-use authorization for children under 12 based on smaller doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics, representing children's doctors, discouraged having children under 12 receive the vaccine. Pfizer's shot has received conditional regulatory approval elsewhere including Britain and the European Union. The two other COVID-19 vaccines given emergency-use authorization - made by Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson - have not yet received full FDA approval. U.S. HIT HARD The United States leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. More than 625,000 Americans have died from the disease, including an average of more than 600 daily in recent weeks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71% of Americans age 12 and older - the population eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines - have gotten at least one dose and 60.2% are fully vaccinated. For the entire population, including children up to age 11 for whom no vaccines are yet approved, 60.7% of Americans have received at least one dose and 51.5% are fully vaccinated. In Pfizer's clinical trial, approximately 12,000 recipients of the vaccine have been followed for at least six months. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement the FDA's approval ""affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed."" The vaccine will now be marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA on Aug. 13 authorized a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer's shot has not yet been authorized for more widespread use as a booster. A third dose of Pfizer's vaccine has significantly improved protection from infection and serious illness among people age 60 and older in Israel compared with those who received two shots, data release by the Israeli health ministry on Sunday showed."
"U.S. Open to offer record overall purse, winners' payout down",1338,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Open will offer total prize money of $57.5 million this year, eclipsing the record payout of $57.2 million set in 2019, tournament organisers said on Monday. The event was held without spectators last year, with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) lowering the prize money to $53.4 million due to lost revenue. Despite the overall increase this year, prize money for the two singles winners has come down from $3 million to $2.5 million, with the runner-up cheque also reduced to $1.25 million, a decrease of $50,000 from 2020. ""Last year was a very difficult year for all of us, and the pandemic had a profound impact on the USTA's financial health,"" said USTA CEO and executive director Mike Dowse. ""Yet we worked -- and continue to work -- extremely hard to ensure that tennis would continue to thrive for the long-term at every level, and that work led to more than four million new and returning players participating in tennis in 2020."" First-round payouts go to $75,000, a jump of 23% from 2020, while second-round prize money rises to $115,000 from $100,000. The USTA added that prize money has also been bumped up in the doubles, mixed doubles and wheelchair events. The U.S. Open, which will welcome back fans this year, starts on Aug. 30.

Pfizer to buy cancer drug developer Trillium in $2.3 bln deal,1295,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday it would buy Canadian drug developer Trillium Therapeutics Inc (TRIL.TO) in a $2.26 billion deal to strengthen its arsenal of blood cancer therapies. Pfizer, which acquired a $25 million stake in Trillium last year, will buy the remaining outstanding shares for $18.50 apiece, representing a 203.8% premium on the stock's last closing price. Pfizer expects to benefit from Canada-based Trillium's blood-cancer therapies that target a ""don't eat me"" signal used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. Forty Seven Inc, which is also developing drugs that target the same antibodies, was bought by Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) for $4.9 billion last year. More than 1 million people worldwide were diagnosed with blood cancer in 2020, representing almost 6% of all cancer diagnoses. The same year, more than 700,000 people worldwide died from a form of blood cancer. Trillium's U.S.-listed shares were trading at $17.73 before the bell on Monday, having fallen 59% in 2021 as of their last close. Pfizer bought nearly 2.3 million Trillium shares at $10.88 each in September. Pfizer's financial adviser for the transaction is BofA Securities Inc, and Centerview Partners LLC is Trillium's.

U.S. blacklists Eritrean official over human rights abuse in Ethiopia's Tigray,3212,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an Eritrean official it accused of being engaged in serious human rights abuse in the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, as Washington warned it would continue to target those involved in prolonging the conflict. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted Filipos Woldeyohannes, the chief of staff of the Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF). The Treasury said he commands EDF forces that have been operating in Tigray. The Treasury accused the forces of being responsible for massacres, sexual assaults and purposely shooting civilians in the streets, among other human rights abuses. ""The United States will continue to identify and pursue action against those involved in serious human rights abuse in Ethiopia and prolonging the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement. The Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said it rejected Washington's action on Monday, adding that the accusations are ""utterly baseless."" ""Eritrea calls on the U.S. Administration to bring the case to an independent adjudication if it indeed has facts to prove its false allegations,"" the statement said. The United States has repeatedly called for Eritrean troops to withdraw from Tigray. Eritrea sent troops to Tigray after Ethiopian federal forces launched an offensive in November in response to attacks on federal government bases by forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Eritrea denied for months that its troops were in the region, but later acknowledged their presence while denying they were responsible for abuses. The U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said in June the country now has ""effective control"" of parts of Tigray, calling for troops to withdraw and for a prompt investigation into abuses, including the abduction of refugees. ""Today’s action demonstrates the United States’ commitment to imposing costs on those responsible for these despicable acts, which worsen a conflict that has led to tremendous suffering by Ethiopians,"" Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in the statement. ""We urge Eritrea to immediately and permanently withdraw its forces from Ethiopia, and urge the parties to the conflict to begin ceasefire negotiations and end human rights abuses,"" Gacki added. President Joe Biden's administration is far advanced in its assessment of whether to call events crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes, Robert Godec, acting assistant secretary of state for the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, said in June. Doctors said hundreds of women reported they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, Reuters reported in April. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said last month that more than 100,000 children in Tigray could suffer life-threatening malnutrition in the next 12 months, as hundreds of thousands in the region face famine conditions.

Egypt to intensify vaccination ahead of a fourth COVID-19 wave,2326,"CAIRO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Egypt will vaccinate all 4.5 million of its state employees against COVID-19 in August and September as it seeks to accelerate vaccinations ahead of a likely fourth wave of infections, the health minister said on Monday. The country's infection rate is still low but started to increase last week and the upward curve is expected to continue for a while, Hala Zayed told a briefing, adding that a significant increase is expected in late September. ""It is important for the Egyptian government and the political leadership that we work to intensify vaccinations in the coming period,"" Zayed said. As part of the programme, all workers in pre-university education, university employees and university students - a total of more than 5 million people - will be vaccinated before the start of the academic year in October, she said. So far, about 10 million people have registered online to get vaccinated and nearly 7.5 million have received at least one dose, Zayed said. The prime minister said in June the government aimed to vaccinate 40% of the population of more than 100 million by the end of this year. Egypt has received millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik, and Johnson & Johnson. It has also produced 15 million doses of Sinovac's vaccine locally, Zayed said, and will receive about 5.2 million doses produced by Pfizer and Moderna in September. The Egyptian Drug Authority on Monday approved an emergency use licence for the locally produced VACSERA-Sinovac vaccines, it said in a statement. The country plans to have 800 vaccine centres running by the end of August, up from 657 currently. Egypt has recorded 286,352 COVID-19 infections as of Sunday, including 16,674 deaths. However, officials and experts say the real number of infections is far higher but is not reflected in government figures because of low coronavirus testing rates and the exclusion of private test results. The first COVID-19 infection from the Delta variant was discovered in Egypt in mid-July, Zayed said, adding that it concerned a 35-year-old woman who did not need hospitalization. Other cases were discovered later among Egyptians but none were hospitalized because they had mild symptoms, she added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Italy reports 44 coronavirus deaths on Monday, 4,168 new cases",916,"ROME, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Italy reported 44 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday, compared with 23 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 4,168 from 5,923. Italy has registered 128,795 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eighth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.49 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 3,928 on Monday up from 3,767 a day earlier. There were 45 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 33 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 485 from a previous 472. Some 101,341 tests for COVID-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 175,539, the health ministry said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Sensor maker Velodyne's founder calls for chairman's resignation,1414,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Velodyne Lidar Inc's (VLDR.O) founder David Hall on Monday called on Chairman Michael Dee to resign from the sensor maker's board, blaming him for a steep fall in the company's stock price. ""Dee has spearheaded major business decisions that leave him responsible for the company's nearly 80% stock price decline, in my view,"" Hall, who was removed as chairman earlier this year, said in an letter to the board. Velodyne did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Velodyne shares were up about 14% on Monday after having tumbled about 80% since the company went public in September through a merger with a blank-check company. Hall had sent another letter to the board in June, calling for the resignation of Anand Gopalan as chief executive officer and Joseph Culkin as chairman, among others. Gopalan left the company in July, while Culkin handed over the chairman's role to Dee earlier this month, citing health reasons. The ongoing saga at the sensor maker was triggered after Hall was removed as chairman and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, as marketing chief in February on the grounds of lack of honesty, a charge Marta said the couple was not allowed to rebut. Hall, in his latest letter, also asked for the removal of director Hamid Zarringhalam. Dee and Zarringhalam did not reply to requests for comment via LinkedIn.

Firefight involving Western forces erupts amid Kabul airport evacuation chaos,5246,"KABUL, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A firefight involving Western forces erupted at Kabul airport on Monday when Afghan guards exchanged fire with unidentified gunmen, Germany's military said, adding to the evacuation chaos as Washington faces pressure to extend its deadline to withdraw. Thousands of Afghans and foreigners have thronged the airport for days, hoping to catch a flight out after Taliban fighters captured Kabul on Aug. 15 and as U.S.-led forces aim to complete their pullout by the end of the month. Twenty people have been killed in the chaos at the airport, most in shootings and stampedes in the heat and dust, penned in by concrete blast walls, as U.S. and international forces try to evacuate their citizens and vulnerable Afghans. One person was killed in Monday's clash, the German military said. CNN said a sniper outside the airport fired at Afghan guards - some 600 former government soldiers are helping U.S. forces at the airport - near its north gate. U.S. and German forces were involved in the clash, Germany's military said. Three wounded Afghan guards were being treated at a field hospital in the airport, it said. Two NATO officials at the airport said the situation was under control after the firing. The Taliban have deployed fighters outside the airport, where they have tried to help enforce some kind of order. On Sunday, Taliban fighters beat back crowds at the airport a day after seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates as the deadline for the withdrawal of foreign troops approaches. The Taliban seized power just over a week ago as the United States and its allies withdraw troops after a 20-year war launched in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as U.S. forces hunted al Qaeda leaders and sought to punish their Taliban hosts. The administration of Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, struck a deal with the Taliban last year allowing the United Sates to withdraw its forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. 'HOURS, NOT WEEKS' President Joe Biden said on Sunday the security situation in Afghanistan was changing rapidly and remained dangerous. ""Let me be clear, the evacuation of thousands from Kabul is going to be hard and painful"" and would have been ""no matter when it began"", Biden said in a briefing at the White House. ""We have a long way to go and a lot could still go wrong."" A soldier assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division provides security at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Afghanistan, August 21, 2021. Picture taken August 21, 2021. U.S. Marine Corps/Cpl. Davis Harris/Handout via REUTERS Biden said U.S. troops might stay beyond their Aug. 31 deadline to oversee the evacuation. But a Taliban leadership official said foreign forces had not sought an extension and it would not be granted if they had. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge Biden this week to extend the deadline. Defence Minister Ben Wallace said Britain was ""down to hours now, not weeks"" in its evacuation plan and forces on the ground needed to use every moment they had to get people out. Johnson's spokesperson said Britain still wanted to fly out thousands of people and had not set a hard deadline for when evacuations end. ""We will continue to run our evacuation process as long as the security situation allows... We need to be flexible in our approach,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it would not be possible for British evacuations to continue once U.S. troops leave. read more Panicked Afghans have clamoured to board flights out of Kabul, fearing reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law that the Sunni Muslim group enforced when it held power from 1996 to 2001. The chaos at the airport is also disrupting shipments of aid going in to Afghanistan. The World Health Organization said 500 tonnes of medical supplies due to be delivered this week were stuck because Kabul airport was closed to commercial flights, Richard Brennan, WHO regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, told Reuters. He said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its storage hub in Dubai to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees in Afghanistan. OPPOSITION Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government, while their forces focus on the last pockets of opposition. Taliban fighters had re-taken three districts in the northern province of Baghlan which opposition forces briefly captured and had surrounded opposition forces in the Panjshir valley, an old stronghold of Taliban opponents northeast of Kabul. ""The enemy is under siege in Panjshir,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Massoud said on Sunday he hoped to hold talks with the Taliban but his forces in Panjshir - remnants of army units, special forces and militiamen - were ready to fight. Zabihullah also said the Taliban wanted to ""solve the problem through talks"". In general, peace has prevailed in recent days. Reuters spoke to eight doctors in hospitals in several cities who said they had not heard of any violence or received any casualties from clashes since Thursday.

"In Canada's pandemic election, unvaccinated candidates are knocking on doors",4661,"MIRAMICHI, New Brunswick, Aug 23 (Reuters) - In Canadian federal elections, it is a tradition for candidates to knock on people's doors to ask for their support. Ahead of next month's vote, most of the contenders doing the rounds will be vaccinated against COVID-19 - but not all of them. The Conservatives, led by the still little-known Erin O'Toole, and the small right-wing People's Party of Canada (PPC) are not requiring inoculations for their candidates as a fourth wave builds mainly among the unvaccinated. This does not sit well with millions of inoculated Canadians, who are enjoying their first taste of freedom and normality after 17 months of pandemic life. Three-quarters of them say they have little sympathy for those who choose not to get the shots, according to an Aug. 17 Angus Reid poll. ""If you have a candidate going door-to-door and they are not vaccinated, and they knock on the door of a senior citizen who is immunocompromised... then they put them in danger,"" said Trevor Boutilier, a 40-year old Ottawa bus driver, who is not planning on voting Conservative for the first time in his life. Two days before calling a snap Sept. 20 vote, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mandated vaccinations for federal employees and domestic air and train travelers, thrusting the issue to the forefront of his election bid. While campaigning in the Atlantic provinces on Sunday, Trudeau brought along Procurement Minister Anita Anand, whom he called his ""minister of vaccines,"" and Liberal candidates wore pins saying ""I'm fully vaccinated."" ""We now need to protect our kids,"" Trudeau said at a Liberal rally in Miramichi, New Brunswick, referring to children under 12 who cannot yet access any of the inoculations. ""We have not finished the fight against COVID-19."" Trudeau, 49, called the election on Aug. 15, two years ahead of schedule, in hopes that his handling of the pandemic, his successful national inoculation campaign and his plans to support an economic rebound would propel Liberals to a majority after relying on the support of opposition parties since 2019. ""The Liberals will want to make (vaccine mandates) a wedge issue because they know that it's divisive within the Conservative tribe,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos. In Canada, 72% of the eligible population has already been vaccinated against COVID-19, and support for a proof-of-vaccination system for travel and public events is above 61% nationally, according to an EKOS poll published on Aug. 16. Even most Conservatives and O'Toole himself have had two shots. But about 15% of Conservative voters still have not been inoculated, compared with 4% of Liberals, the EKOS poll said. A third of PPC voters have not been vaccinated. PPC leader Maxime Bernier on Friday called Trudeau's vaccine mandate for domestic travel ""fascist,"" making it clear where right-leaning voters can go if O'Toole were to agree with Trudeau. ""This mirrors what's going on in the United States, with Republicans being much less likely to vaccinate than Democrats,"" EKOS President Frank Graves said. Unlike in the United States, Canadian politicians of different stripes have, by and large, approached the fight against COVID-19 as a non-partisan national health issue. POLLS TIGHTENING O'Toole, 48, has argued that his position on federal workers is essentially the same as the Liberals' because the mandate is not likely to be fully enforced, with the main union representing public servants saying accommodations like testing must be made. But the Conservative leader has struggled more to defend his position on candidates and travel. A campaign official declined to say how many Conservative candidates had not been vaccinated. ""Erin O'Toole won't come clean on which candidates he is putting forward... who won't get vaccinated,"" Trudeau said on Thursday. O'Toole last week urged his unvaccinated candidates to get the shots and said those who do not would be required to take daily tests during the campaign. Polls have tightened since the race began, in part because many voters did not like the idea of having an election during a pandemic, pollsters say. During the initial days of the campaign, O'Toole shunned in-person rallies for virtual events, calling ""Mr. Trudeau's pandemic election"" a threat to public health. Trudeau says the pandemic is the reason an election is needed, so Canadians can choose the party that will lead them safely through it. The Liberals would win 32.4% of the vote, compared with 32.8% for the Conservatives, putting the parties in a statistical tie, according to an EKOS poll from Sunday.

Brazil's Bolsonaro wants date for ending mask use,1567,"BRASÍLIA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday that he will ask his health minister to set a date to end the use of face masks as a means of reducing transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil. Maks have become a political issue in Brazil, with Bolsonaro long ranting against their use and frequently refusing to wear one in public despite a legal requirement to do so. In the radio interview, the president argued that with much of the population already vaccinated or having caught the virus, masks are not needed. But epidemiologists say it is too early for such a move, especially due to the rise of the Delta variant in Brazil. Although nearly 60% of Brazil's population have received their first dose, only 25% are fully vaccinated. Bolsonaro said he had also commissioned a study into the use of mask wearing with a view to recommending an end to their widespread use. At over 570,000, Brazil has the world's second highest coronavirus death toll behind only the United States, propelled - according to epidemiologists - by a lack of coordinated national social distancing measures. Bolsonaro said he hoped a date for ending the widespread use of masks could be set later on Monday. Any such move could prove to be largely moot, however, with states and municipalities free to set their own COVID-19 restrictions in Brazil. Any federal government position on the matter would likely only function as a guideline, though it would be considered a victory by Bolsonaro's far-right base.

Israel finds COVID-19 vaccine booster significantly lowers infection risk,2478,"JERUSALEM, Aug 22 (Reuters) - A third dose of Pfizer (PFE.N)'s COVID-19 vaccine has significantly improved protection from infection and serious illness among people aged 60 and older in Israel compared with those who received two shots, findings published by the Health Ministry showed on Sunday. The data were presented at a meeting of a ministry panel of vaccination experts on Thursday and uploaded to its website on Sunday, though the full details of the study were not released. The findings were on par with separate statistics reported last week by Israel's Maccabi healthcare provider, one of several organisations administering booster shots to try to curb the Delta coronavirus variant. Latest COVID-19 news Breaking down statistics from Israel's Gertner Institute and KI Institute, ministry officials said that among people aged 60 and over, the protection against infection provided from 10 days after a third dose was four times higher than after two doses. A medical worker prepares to administer a patient's third dose of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine as country launches booster shots for over 40-year-olds, in Jerusalem August 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ammar Awad A third jab for over 60-year-olds offered five to six times greater protection after 10 days with regard to serious illness and hospitalisation. That age group is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and in Israel was the first to be inoculated when the vaccine drive began in late December. In recent weeks, the health ministry has said immunity has diminished over time for seniors and younger people as well. Most vaccinated people who fell severely ill in Israel were over 60 and with underlying health conditions. Israel started administering third jabs to over 60-year-olds on July 30. On Thursday it dropped the age of eligibility for a booster to 40, and included pregnant women, teachers and health care workers below that age. Third doses are given only to those who received their second shot at least five months ago. The United States has announced plans to offer booster shots to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection. Canada, France and Germany have announced booster campaigns. Fighting an outbreak of the Delta variant since June, Israel presently has one of the world's highest infection rates per capita. Close to 1.5 million people out of the country's 9.3 million population have taken a third jab. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Lawyer for 'Hotel Rwanda' hero deported for visa violation,2657,"KIGALI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A Belgian lawyer for the man whose story inspired the film ""Hotel Rwanda"", who is being tried on terrorism charges, has been deported for working without a permit, the head of Rwanda's immigration service said on Monday. Paul Rusesabagina, the ex-hotelier portrayed as a hero in the 2004 film about Rwanda's 1994 genocide, is accused of nine terrorism-related charges, including forming and funding an armed rebel group. Vincent Lurquin was deported on Saturday after appearing in court as one of Rusesabagina's lawyers the previous day despite lacking legal permission to do so, officials said. ""He did some work, but he was not authorized to work,"" Regis Gatarayiha, director general at the Rwanda Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration, told Reuters. Lurquin was in the country on a visitor's visa, Gatarayiha said. ""He is a lawyer of Rusesabagina in a case in Belgium ... [but] to be able to assist him in courts of Rwanda - he is not a lawyer who is accredited by the Rwanda Bar Association,"" said Gatarayiha. Lurquin should have first gotten accreditation from the Rwanda Bar Association and then obtained a permit from Rwanda immigration, which he did not do, Gatarayiha said. ""Any claims that he illegally or clandestinely entered under a tourist visa are unequivocally false,"" Rusesabagina's legal team said in a statement. Lurquin had been representing Rusesabagina in a Belgium-based investigation and needed to speak to his client, according to the statement. ""With the assistance and knowledge of the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he arrived in Kigali, and told the Rwanda immigration authorities that he was a lawyer, coming into Rwanda to visit a detained client. He was given a visa by the Rwandan immigration officials,"" the statement said. The official record of Friday's trial did not include Lurquin appearing on behalf of Rusesabagina, who was represented only by a Rwandan lawyer, the statement said. All Rusesabagina's non-Rwandan lawyers have in the past said that they were denied permits to defend him in Rwandan courts. The Rwanda Bar Association said Lurquin was not a member of the organization and was not allowed to practice in the country. Government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo responded to the Association's statement on Twitter, saying Lurquin's behaviour was ""crooked"" and a ""desperate"" attempt to distract from the facts of the trial. Prosecutors have requested a life sentence for Rusesabagina, whose family says he is in poor health and being mistreated in prison. The court is scheduled to issue its verdict on Sept. 20.

Next Swedish PM to face gang violence and rise of far right,3418,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Sweden's Social Democrats will pick a new leader in November to replace Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, needing to find a flag-bearer who can convince voters the party can stop a tide of gang violence and restore the welfare state after the pandemic. Lofven, who leads a minority government, will step down less than a year ahead of a election due in September 2022. Polls so far show an even split between a broadly leftish grouping and a right-wing opposition alliance of parties including the far-right, populist Sweden Democrats. Lofven relies on varying degrees of support from the Greens, the formerly Communist Left and the liberal Centre Party, which abandoned its allies on the right after the 2018 election over their willingness to work with the far right. The successor to Lofven, who has been known as a dealmaker but a lacklustre campaigner, is likely to have to walk a similar tightrope - while also rebuilding the economy after the coronavirus pandemic and tackling the surge in gun crime. ""Sweden has some huge challenges coming up,"" Nick Aylott, associate professor of political science at Sodertorn University, said. ""The biggest one is law and order."" Shootings have become an almost daily occurrence in cities such as Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo and the far right has succeeded in linking the violence with the generous immigration policies of recent decades. read more Sweden has clamped down on immigration, but support for the Sweden Democrats has still grown, with opinion polls showing law and order a key issue ahead of next year's vote.

Euro zone business boom roared on in August -PMI,3941,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Business activity in the euro zone grew strongly this month, only dipping from July's two-decade high monthly pace, as a rapid COVID-19 vaccination drive allowed more firms to reopen and customers to venture out, a survey showed. Without ongoing supply chain disruptions, activity could have expanded faster, but fears new coronavirus strains may lead to renewed restrictions continued to dent optimism. IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a guide to economic health, fell to 59.5 in August from 60.2 last month. It was ahead of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction but just shy of a Reuters poll estimate for 59.7. ""The euro zone economy is firing on all cylinders again as reopening has had the expected positive effect on growth. Concerns about the impact of the Delta variant and input shortages remain but have not derailed the rebound thus far,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. Both the services and manufacturing indices remained in growth territory in Germany, confirming Europe's biggest economy was on a recovery path, an earlier survey showed. read more Economic growth in Germany could miss projections this year and the resurgence of the pandemic may put unexpected strain on the economy in the autumn, the Bundesbank said in a monthly report on Monday. read more In France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, growth in business activity slowed compared to July but remained resilient, as problems with supplies of goods and COVID-19 health protocols impacted trade. read more But Britain's post-lockdown economic bounce-back slowed sharply as companies struggled with unprecedented shortages of staff and materials, although strong inflation pressures cooled. NL8N2PR3H9 ""Overall, August's flash PMIs underline two key risks to our forecasts. First, that the economic recovery might be slowing a bit faster than we had thought, posing a downside risk to our view that the economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by October,"" said Kieran Tompkins at Capital Economics. ""Second, that materials and staff shortages might feed into second-round effects of rising wage growth, meaning that inflation is higher for longer."" Markets were unmoved by the PMI data and were instead focused on worries about the Delta variant hampering growth as investors weighed up the possible timeline for the tapering of monetary stimulus ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole this week. JOB BOOST Firms increased headcount in the euro zone at a near-record pace but were still unable to complete all new business coming in, building up a backlog of work at the third-fastest pace in survey history. The composite employment index held at 56.1. A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry nudged down to 59.7 from July's 15-year high of 59.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 59.8. Demand slowed marginally from July - suggesting the rebound will continue - but the services business expectations index, which measure optimism about the year ahead, dropped to 68.6 from 69.1. ""We continue to see the potential spread of more virulent virus variants and the prolongation of supply chain issues as the main risks to the economic recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics. ""Therefore, the level of uncertainty around the forecast remains very high, but we still expect a strong recovery over the coming quarters."" Manufacturers had another solid month, their PMI remaining well above the breakeven mark at 61.5, albeit below July's 62.8 and the 62.0 poll estimate. An index measuring output that feeds into to the composite PMI fell to 59.2 from 61.1. But supply delays - the delivery times index was near a survey low - again played a key role in driving up the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index was 87.3, although down from July's record high of 89.2. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Kabul airport curbs blocking medical supplies for Afghans -WHO,2060,"GENEVA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - More than 500 tonnes of medical supplies including surgical equipment and severe malnutrition kits due to be delivered to Afghanistan this week are stuck because of Kabul airport restrictions, the World Health Organization said on Monday. Aid agencies say it is critical that medical and food supplies reach some 300,000 people displaced in Afghanistan over the past two months amid advances by Islamist Taliban insurgents that culminated in their capture of Kabul on Aug. 15. Nearly 18.5 million people - half the population - rely on aid and the humanitarian needs are expected to grow due to drought. read more But the closure of Kabul airport to commercial flights has held up deliveries, WHO regional emergency director Dr. Richard Brennan told Reuters. ""While the eyes of the world now are on the people being evacuated and the planes leaving, we need to get supplies in to help those who are left behind,"" Brennan said in an emailed statement. He said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its warehouse in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees from Afghanistan. The United States has enlisted six commercial airlines to help move Afghan evacuees, however Washington and NATO coalition partners have so far indicated that they cannot bring supplies on incoming evacuation planes due to ""operational constraints and security concerns"", Brennan said. read more ""The U.S. is using these commercial airlines only for evacuation,"" he said, adding that the WHO was exploring various options and reaching out to other governments. ""We have been advised to explore options at other airports such as Kandahar, Jalalabad and Bagram air bases. We do not yet have aircraft to fly even to those bases."" The executive director of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said on Monday around 10 million children across Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance and that conditions are expected to deteriorate further.

Vietnam deploys troops to enforce COVID lockdown in largest city,2467,"HANOI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam deployed soldiers on Monday to help enforce a strict COVID lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, its biggest urban area and current epicentre of its worst coronavirus outbreak to date. Vietnam implemented movement restrictions in Ho Chi Minh City in early July, but announced its harshest curbs last week as infections have continued to surge. Authorities have said enforcement of recent curbs has not been sufficiently strict. After containing COVID-19 for much of last year, Vietnam has recorded 358,456 infections and at least 8,666 fatalities. Ho Chi Minh City has recorded over 180,000 infections - half the country's total - and 7,010 deaths, making up about 80% of the nation's fatalities, according to the health ministry. Most of those cases have been recorded in Ho Chi Minh City and its surrounding industrial provinces, where the Delta variant of the virus has sent numbers soaring since late April. The government said on Friday a tighter lockdown would begin on Monday, prohibiting people from leaving their homes, even for food, and said the military would step in to help. The announcement, later amended so that people in some areas could still shop for food, was subsequently reverted to a total ban, triggering confusion and panic-buying at supermarkets in the city over the weekend. read more Witnesses said soldiers were delivering food to residents of the city on Monday and images broadcast by state media showed armed soldiers manning checkpoints and checking documents. Vietnam has over recent weeks sent 14,600 additional doctors and nurses to the city and its neighbouring provinces to support its overwhelmed medical system, the ministry said. Patients with mild or no symptoms have been told to self isolate at home. The government said on Friday it would send 130,000 tonnes of rice from state stockpiles to Ho Chi Minh City and 23 other cities and provinces. People in the city's Phu Nhuan and Go Vap districts told Reuters they had received packages of rice, meat, fish and vegetables from the military. Vietnam received two shipments of 501,600 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses from Poland and 200,000 Sinopharm doses donation from China on Monday, the government said. In total, the country has secured over 23 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines but just 1.8% of its 98 million people have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the region.

Studies show modest job gains from U.S. states' benefit cuts,5549,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - New U.S. state-level data and accompanying studies show a group of largely Republican governors did not yet get the job boom they hoped for by cutting federal unemployment benefits this summer, but the loss of the stipend did appear to prompt some of the unemployed to take jobs. Underlying that topline conclusion, however, is also evidence of a more nuanced reshuffling among different employment categories that could have bearing on the economy's performance in the critical months to come. Separate analyses released last week, using different data sets and methods, concluded that the 26 states that cut a $300 weekly federal unemployment stipend this summer did see the unemployed find a job at a faster rate, perhaps as much as 6 percentage points, than did the 24 states planning to continue the benefit at least until its scheduled national expiration in early September. However, the states that cut benefits saw worse results in pulling people back into the formal labor force, to the degree that overall job growth in the two groups of states was nearly identical from May through July. In the U.S. government's regular employment surveys, people are considered unemployed only if they are looking for a job; others are considered out of the labor force until they start a job or begin a job search. While the end of federal supplemental unemployment benefits may have motivated people to take jobs in the one group of states, ""in non-cutoff states employment rose almost as much by bringing people back into the labor force,"" meaning people who had not been looking for work at all in the previous month had started a search and found a job, wrote Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed. Goldman Sachs economists reached a similar conclusion. Though neither offered a comprehensive explanation for why that difference may have emerged between the two groups of states, the finding could spell trouble for continued job gains this fall if coronavirus cases continue to surge. Federal Reserve officials and others expect robust employment gains in the coming months as schools reopen, daily life edges back to normal - and the extra federal unemployment benefits expire nationally. Arguments about the continued need for the benefits, pressed most pointedly by Republican state leaders, emerged in the spring as national coronavirus case rates collapsed amid the first rounds of COVID-19 vaccinations, job openings soared, and employers complained they had trouble getting people to come back to work. The Goldman Sachs study noted that the cut in benefits appeared to have its biggest impact on lower-paid workers in the leisure and hospitality industry - an intuitive finding since the weekly federal benefit represents a higher proportion of the pay they would receive from returning to work. Yet those jobs are also the most susceptible if the surge in the virus changes people's willingness to participate in ""close contact"" services. At the same time, Goldman noted that its findings ""suggest"" those who left the labor force since the start of the pandemic ""did so for non-financial reasons such as concern about Covid."" Just as they did not flock back to the job market this summer in the states that cut benefits, they may not do so in the other states this fall if the disease is spreading. ""Our finding that benefit expiration did not encourage labor force participation was a somewhat negative surprise, and increases the risk that some workers may be slow to return to the labor force, particularly if the Delta variant increases concerns around health risk,"" wrote Goldman economists Joseph Briggs and Ronnie Walker. Some of the major states that cut benefits, including Florida and Texas, also saw the start last month of an overwhelming wave of new coronavirus cases. Goldman's base case remains for strong employment growth through the end of the year, with 3.4 million jobs added through December, and a 4.1% year-end unemployment rate that's below some economists' estimation of full employment. IMPACT ON CONSUMPTION Both the numbers of unemployed and those out of the labor force increased markedly during the pandemic, and policymakers hope improved hiring among each group will trim or even fully reclaim the 5.7 million jobs still missing from before the pandemic. U.S. firms added jobs at a rapid pace this summer, nearly a million a month in June and July. But the record level of job openings suggested the job gains could have been even greater, perhaps by as much as 400,000, Goldman estimated. On that basis, the national expiration of unemployment benefits, slated for early September, would prompt an additional 1.5 million people to take jobs by the end of the year, Goldman estimated. A similar study by a group including University of Massachusetts Amherst professor Arindrajit Dube also concluded the unemployed were more likely to find jobs in states that cut benefits, and saw ""a modest, but precisely measured increase in the probability of job finding in the Withdrawal states,"" of about 4.4 percentage points. Yet they concluded it was ultimately a bad deal for the states involved. The group had a slight increase in earnings, but lost far more in federal benefits, with a net drop of consumption in those states of about $2 billion. Goldman economists concurred that the loss of unemployment benefits will likely contribute to an upcoming drag on the economy as an array of pandemic-era programs expire.

Analysis: Risks of party revolt grow for Japan's PM Suga after local poll loss,4040,"TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Unpopular Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga looks increasingly vulnerable to a challenge from within his party for the nation's top job after an ally's defeat in a local election on Sunday seen as a referendum on Suga's COVID-19 response. If Suga loses, he would join a long list of short-term premiers. He took over in September after Shinzo Abe quit, citing ill health and ending a rare lengthy term of nearly eight years. Suga, whose term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader ends next month, has seen his support slide from highs of about 70% to below 30%, with a weekend poll by ANN News putting support at 25.8% as Japan battles an explosive surge of COVID-19 infections. On Monday, domestic media reported that former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is likely to run in the LDP's leadership race. read more The defeat of Hachiro Okonogi, son of Suga's political mentor and a former cabinet minister, in Sunday's election for Yokohama city mayor, will most likely amplify calls to replace Suga ahead of a lower house election that must be held by November. Opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan candidate Takeharu Yamanaka, a former professor of public health, won by a landslide in Suga's constituency near Tokyo. L1N2PT063 ""The LDP is being severely criticised in my constituency, so it's very hard to fight under Suga,"" said a junior LDP lawmaker from a conservative rural district, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. Such views are expected to spread. ""For certain, voices saying they can't fight the general election under Suga will grow louder,"" said political analyst Atsuo Ito. ""The chances of multiple candidates (in the LDP race) will increase."" Still, uncertainty remains. Suga told reporters on Monday there was no change in his plan to run in the LDP poll. No party bosses who backed Suga last year have publicly withdrawn support. ""We should not change the ship's captain in the midst of a storm,"" one senior LDP lawmaker said ahead of the mayoral vote. ELECTION TRACK RECORD Scenarios include Suga losing the LDP race to a rival, bowing out early, or winning the party vote and keeping his job if LDP losses in the lower house poll are limited. Suga's election track record isn't good. Abe led his coalition to victory in six national elections, but Suga ha seen defeats in by-elections and a lacklustre showing in a Tokyo local poll. Lower house members' four-year terms end on Oct. 21. An election for the chamber must be held by Nov. 28 but is expected sooner. Suga's had hoped to contain the virus outbreak and call a general election after a successful Olympics. That scenario was upended after a COVID-19 surge led to a fourth state of emergency in Tokyo. Alongside Kishida, former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, an Abe disciple, has said she wants to run, as has Seiko Noda, another female ex-cabinet minister. Both are seen as long-shots, as is former education minister Hakubun Shimomura. Administrative Reform Minister Taro Kono, running Japan's lagging vaccination rollout, and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba top of the list of lawmakers voters favour as next premier, followed by Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. Kishida, once seen as Abe's heir, ranks rock bottom. Abe himself has single-digit support. Prime ministers have sometimes survived poor ratings but Suga is at particular risk because his term as party president is ending just as a general election looms. Decisions by party bosses, including Abe, his ally Finance Minister Taro Aso, and their rival, LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, matter greatly. But younger lawmakers may be more worried about losing their seats than toeing the party line. Those MPs ""are very uneasy about their own elections. It's unclear whether they would vote for Suga even if their faction bosses told them to do so,"" analyst Ito said.

"Analysis: China, Pakistan, India jockey for position in Afghanistan's new Great Game",6037,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Russian and British empires battled over Afghanistan in the 19th century, and the United States and the Soviet Union in the 20th. As the Taliban takes over in the strategic, landlocked nation, the new Great Game has Pakistan in control, with its ally China looking to cement its grip on the region. Pakistan has deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the Islamist group as it battled the U.S.-backed government in Kabul - charges denied by Islamabad. When the Taliban captured Kabul last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Afghans had broken the ""shackles of slavery"". As the Taliban holds discussions to decide on its government model, media reports have said some Pakistani officials are involved. A Foreign Office spokesperson in Islamabad said Pakistan wanted an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan that ensured peace and stability in the region but added the ""key role remains with the Afghans"". China, with no previous involvement in Afghanistan but a strong alliance with Pakistan, has held out an olive branch to the Taliban, enticed by the country's mineral wealth, including its large reserves of lithium, a key component for electric vehicles. China is also looking at the prospect of extra security for its narrow land route through the Karakoram mountains into Pakistan. And then there is India - Pakistan's old enemy, which has been locked in a military standoff with China along their disputed border for more than a year. India was a key supporter of the ousted regime in Kabul and as both Pakistan and China become key players in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, New Delhi's nervousness in increasing. China however says its main aim in reaching out to the Taliban is to protect its western Xinjiang region from anti-Beijing East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) militants, who could seek sanctuary within Afghanistan. ""While Pakistan might be thinking of leveraging on Afghanistan against India, this is not necessarily the case for China,"" said Zhang Li, a professor of South Asian studies at Sichuan University. ""China's primary concern now is for the Taliban to ... build an inclusive and moderate regime so that terrorism would not spill over to Xinjiang and the region. Any other calculus further to that remains to be seen."" The U.S. government says ETIM no longer exists as a formal organization and is instead a broad label China uses to oppress a variety of Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs, in its Xinjiang region. China denies all accusations of abuse. China has dangled the prospect of providing the two things the Taliban needs to govern Afghanistan: diplomatic recognition and much-needed infrastructure and economic assistance, said Brahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. ""An opportunistic China is certain to exploit the new opening to make strategic inroads into mineral-rich Afghanistan and deepen its penetration of Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia,"" he said. BITTER MEMORIES There was much cheering in Pakistan over India's discomfiture at the turn of events, said Raza Ahmad Rumi, a political commentator, who teaches at Ithaca College in New York. The two countries have fought three wars since they became independent nations when the subcontinent was divided in 1947. ""The jubilation in Pakistan witnessed on social media and TV screens was largely linked to the undoing of Indian influence as conventional policy circles viewed (Afghan President Ashraf) Ghani's close links with India as a threat,"" Rumi said. India has bitter memories of the previous Taliban stint in power from 1996 to 2001 and the group's links to Pakistan. An Indian Airlines plane was hijacked in 1999 and ultimately landed in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. New Delhi freed three senior Pakistani militants in its jails in exchange for the return of the passengers and the Taliban allowed the hijackers and the released prisoners to go to Pakistan. ""Our position today is one of adjusting to reality. We have to play the long game in Afghanistan. We don't have a contiguous border but we have stakes there,"" said Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Kabul. Over the past year as the Taliban emerged as a dominant force and U.S.-brokered negotiations began in Doha, Indian diplomats had opened a line with the group, diplomatic sources in New Delhi said. ""We are talking to all stakeholders,"" one of them said, but did not want to get to the specifics of the discussions. There has been criticism at home that India put all its eggs in the basket of the Ghani government when the United States itself had begun talks with the Taliban, and that New Delhi left it too late. 'NOT A RE-RUN' Still, India as a major economic player can be attractive to the Taliban, looking to avoid an over-dependence on China, the source said. India has development projects in every one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, small and big, including the parliament building in Kabul that it built, which was over-run by gun-toting Taliban men after sweeping into the city last week. Myra MacDonald, author of three books on South Asia and a former Reuters journalist, said while the Taliban takeover was a setback for India, it was not game over for New Delhi. ""This is not a re-run of the past. Everyone is going to be much more careful this time about letting Islamist terrorism in Afghanistan explode as in the pre-9/11 days."" ""Plus in relative terms, India is much more economically stronger than Pakistan this time around."" A senior member of the Taliban has told Reuters that impoverished Afghanistan needs help from countries in the region, including Iran, as well as the United States and Russia. ""We expect them to help us, to support our people, especially the health sector and especially the business sector and mining sector,"" said Waheedullah Hashimi, who has access to the group's decision-making. ""Our job is to convince them to accept us."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"With DOJ's focus on wage fixing and no poach agreements, non-compete and antitrust laws collide",7917,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. August 23, 2021 - Many business executives have at least a passing familiarity with restrictive covenants, which generally come in two flavors: non-competes (which preclude an employee from working for a competitor for a set period of time) and non-solicits (which preclude an employee from soliciting clients or other employees once they depart). These agreements are made directly between an employer and an employee, and it is likely that many of these same executives have been subject to one at some point in their career. In the last few years restrictive covenants have received scrutiny from some states, and even the federal government, but that scrutiny generally has been focused on the enforceability of restrictive covenants with lower-level employees (often measured by salary thresholds). Far more serious scrutiny has been paid to agreements between companies not to hire (or ""poach"") each other's employees or to fix the compensation of those employees. While restrictive covenants are generally enforceable in most states to the extent that they are narrowly tailored to protect a legitimate interest — like protecting the employer's goodwill or confidential information for a reasonable period of time — wage fixing and so-called ""naked"" no-poach agreements (agreements without legitimate, legal justifications) are generally viewed as purely anticompetitive behavior. In addition to not being enforceable, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission brought civil enforcement actions against companies like Lucasfilm, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Google, eBay, Intel and Intuit arising out of these types of agreements. Those civil enforcement actions typically resulted in promises by the companies to end such agreements and institute compliance or monitoring programs, but no penalties. In 2016, during the final months of the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued joint ""Antitrust Guidance for Human Resources Professionals"" asserting the illegality of, and potential penalties for, entering into agreements to (1) fix the salary or other terms of compensation, whether at a specific level or within a range, for employees (wage fixing agreements); or (2) preclude companies from hiring or soliciting each other's employees without justification (no poaching agreements). The Antitrust Guidance emphasized that wage fixing agreements and no poaching agreements could subject companies and individuals to criminal, as well as civil, actions. There has been a marked change in the federal government's approach to wage fixing agreements and no-poach agreements in the wake of the Antitrust Guidance. The DOJ was clear in its 2016 Antitrust Guidance that it intended to proceed criminally against ""naked wage fixing or no-poaching agreements"" and that it would ""criminally investigate allegations that employers have agreed among themselves on employee compensation or not to solicit or hire each other's employees."" See Antitrust Guidance at 4. Several such investigations were announced during the Trump administration, with charges being filed in the final days of the administration. As the DOJ warned, criminal charges were brought not just against companies, but against allegedly culpable individuals as well. In December 2020 the DOJ indicted Neeraj Jindal, the former owner of Integrity Home Therapy, a physical therapy staffing company, under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) for price fixing and antitrust conspiracy. See U.S. v. Jindal, 20-cr-00358-ALM-KPJ (E.D. Tex. 2020). The DOJ alleged that the company entered into agreements with competitors to suppress competition by agreeing to fix prices by lowering the pay rate of physical therapists. A month later the DOJ brought a criminal action against Surgical Care Affiliates, an operator of outpatient surgical facilities, alleging that an agreement with competitors not to poach each other's senior executives violated the same provision of the Sherman Act, this time styled as a conspiracy in restraint of trade to allocate employees. See U.S. v. Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC, et al., 21-cr-00011-L (N.D. Tex. 2021). As part of the alleged conspiracy, the DOJ claimed that between 2010 and 2017, Surgical Care Affiliates and other companies not named in the indictment had refrained from reaching out to each other's senior employees — though it appears that employees could be interviewed if they previously had informed their supervisor they were looking for a new job, and then applied for a position on their own. According to the DOJ, this was per se unlawful. Surgical Care filed a motion to dismiss that was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as amicus curiae. The DOJ filed a superseding indictment earlier this month, maintaining the per se illegality theory of liability. The Biden administration seems poised to ramp up the use of criminal indictments against companies that enter into naked no-poach agreements. On July 14, 2021, the DOJ brought charges against DaVita Inc., another health care company, and its former CEO Kent Thiry for allegedly participating in the Surgical Care Affiliates conspiracy. See U.S. v. DaVita Inc. et al., 21-cr-00229-RBJ (Dist. Colo 2021). This is just part of the Biden administration's focus on restrictive covenants. Just a few days prior to the DaVita indictment, the Biden administration released an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. The Executive Order signals a ""Whole-of-Government Competition Policy"" that will use various federal laws, including the Sherman Act, to promote competition and (where necessary) break up monopolies. The Executive Order, among other things, directs the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC to consider revising the 2016 antitrust guidance to better protect workers from wage collusion. As explained in the Fact Sheet accompanying the Executive Order, the Executive Order encourages ""the FTC and DOJ to strengthen antitrust guidance to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits by sharing wage and benefit information with one another"" and further encourages the ""FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements."" It remains to be seen how far such guidance, and prosecutions, will go — but decision makers should navigate these new waters carefully. It is now more important than ever that employers, especially those in highly concentrated markets with fewer competing businesses, have a clear understanding of the boundary between legitimate restrictive covenants and anti-competitive behavior.

Philippines reports record virus cases as Delta variant spreads,1800,"MANILA, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Philippines health ministry reported a record 18,332 COVID-19 infections on Monday and for the first time acknowledged community transmission of the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus in its capital region. The region, an urban sprawl containing the capital, Manila, and 16 cities home to more than 13 million people, had been subject to strict lockdown measures which were relaxed for 10 days from Aug. 21 to allow more businesses to operate. read more ""Widespread lockdown or restrictions are no longer effective in the country,"" health ministry spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference on Monday. ""It would be more effective if restrictions were loosened a bit and if lockdowns were more targeted"". Large numbers of Delta variant cases for which the source could not be traced had been detected in the capital region and nearby provinces, the health ministry said in a separate statement. Authorities have for several weeks attributed the current rise in cases to the Delta variant, but genome sequencing capacity in the Philippines is limited, with only a few thousand samples processed weekly. On Monday, the country's genome centre said it had detected an additional 466 Delta variant cases, bringing the number of people confirmed to be carrying the variant to 1,273. The Philippines has recorded a total of 1.86 million COVID-19 cases, the statement said, a fifth of which were detected over the last 40 days. Nearly 32,000 people in the Philippines have died with COVID-19, according to official data. The number of active cases in the country increased to a four-month high of 130,350, the statement added.

"Delta variant, having put kibosh on Fed event, begins to menace recovery",6761,"WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic dealt its most visible blow yet as Federal Reserve officials abruptly cancelled their premier in-person conference, raising questions about their insistence the economy faces limited risk from the Delta strain and plans to dial back crisis-era support. The setback, announced late Friday, with the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium now virtual for the second straight year, is the latest in a series of small but accumulating signs the new surge is having more of an impact than Fed officials anticipated. read more Chair Jerome Powell was already scheduled to deliver his keynote speech on Friday by webcast.

Until now, Powell has downplayed the impact of Delta. People and businesses had learned to ""live their lives, despite COVID,"" he said, indicating the central bank's outlook for an improving economy remained intact despite the resurgence in cases and uneven vaccination rates. ""People and businesses have improvised and learned to adapt,"" Powell said in an Aug. 17 webcast event with teachers and students. U.S. economic growth surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter and is likely to be revised higher later this week. That confidence could now be mislaid with the quickly evolving situation causing a dashboard of indicators to flash some potential warning signs. HIGH-FREQUENCY DATA FALTERS Nearly all of the recovery measures for individual U.S. states tracked by Oxford Economics fell for the latest week available. States in the South saw the sharpest drops, led by Louisiana, Florida, and Mississippi. ""Greater consumer caution weakened demand and mobility, which fell to multiweek lows. Employment soured, production retrenched, and the health tracker fell on surging Delta variant contagion,"" Oxford's team of U.S. economists wrote. COVID-19 deaths in the United States reached a five-month high last week as the more contagious Delta variant runs rampant in areas with low vaccination rates. Cases continue to rise and the United States, as of Friday, was averaging about 139,000 new infections each day. Small business hiring tracked by time management company Homebase has edged down, while Bank of America credit and debit card data showed a decline in spending on leisure in the last seven days. Restaurant bookings through OpenTable have also fallen in recent days. U.S. consumer sentiment also dropped sharply in early August, hitting its lowest level in a decade, with more negative outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment, a University of Michigan survey showed. ""We have made all the easy wins of reopening, and the plain fact is the virus is catching up with us. So there is some cooling ... economists got a little over-enthusiastic,"" said Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed staffer who is chief economist at BNY Mellon Asset Management. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs economists lowered their forecast for third-quarter economic growth to 5.5% from 9%, citing the Delta variant's prolonged impact, although they revised up their estimates for the fourth quarter and most of next year. Others caution not to read too much into the softening after a surge in economic activity amid the reopening and pent-up demand being released over the summer. ""So far, real-world impacts have been relatively small and localized,"" said Jefferies in its analysis of real-time data, noting declines in restaurant bookings had been led by states with large COVID-19 outbreaks, such as Florida and Texas. There does, however, appear to be a growing crisis of confidence among some major employers, many of whose offices have been half-empty for more than 18 months. On Thursday, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) delayed the return to its corporate offices to January at the earliest. read more Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, one of the central bank's most forceful supporters for reducing support for the economy, said on Friday the impact of the Delta variant was ""unfolding rapidly"" and that he may adjust his views on monetary policy ""somewhat"" should it slow economic growth materially. Kaplan has previously said he would like the Fed to begin tapering its asset purchases in October. read more SUPPLY-CHAIN ISSUES Fed policymakers are also keenly watching the handful of categories that have contributed to an outsized jump in inflation due to supply-chain bottlenecks, as well as any signs price pressures may be broadening. Many at the Fed, including Powell, maintain that current high inflation readings are temporary and will ebb back towards the central bank's 2% average goal, but some policymakers are growing more anxious. U.S. consumer price increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on an annual basis, and there were tentative signs inflation has peaked. The surge fueled by the Delta variant is pressuring that premise. China's 'zero tolerance' COVID-19 policy saw a terminal at its second-largest container port by handling volume temporarily shut down last week due to an outbreak, and several other Chinese ports faced further congestion as vessels were diverted and cargo processing slowed due to stricter disinfection measures. read more Leading international shipping groups warned clients of delays and route adjustments as global supply chains came under further strain, which could keep price pressures elevated in the United States for a range of parts and goods. The months-long shortage of global semiconductors that has pushed up prices of new and used vehicles shows no signs of abating as the Delta variant spreads across Asian countries that are home to auto factories and chip plants. Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales volumes, said on Thursday it would slash its planned global production for September by 40%, a move that impacts most of its North American factories. read more Should U.S. supply issues, including a shortage of labor, persist even as vaccinations, boosters, better treatments and healthy savings keep demand from cratering, the chances of a blunder by the Fed goes up if it is forced to quickly raise interest rates to keep a lid on inflation, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""What many once hoped would be a sprint has become a marathon of a pandemic with the finish line a mirage,"" Swonk said. ""The risk of a policy misstep and a premature end to this business cycle is rising."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Japan asks Tokyo hospitals to accept more COVID-19 patients,1472,"TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Japanese government and the Tokyo Metropolitan government appealed on Monday to hospitals in the capital to accept more COVID-19 patients as increasing infections has made it increasingly difficult to get access to care. Fewer than one in 10 coronavirus patients is hospitalised in Tokyo, fuelling public frustration with the government's COVID-19 response and undermining voter support for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. read more ""The Delta variant's strong infectiousness just isn't comparable to previous ones,"" said Health Minister Norihisa Tamura, as he stood with Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. ""We would like to have further support from the medical community to secure hospital beds for coronavirus patients."" This was the first time the national government had issued such a request based on the infectious diseases control law, Tamura said. With infections showing no sign of slowing down, the government is considering expanding areas covered by state of emergency measures, the Kyodo news agency said. Emergency measures are now in force in 13 prefectures, including Tokyo. While infection numbers in Japan have been setting daily records, the number of deaths per day has stayed at less than a quarter of the record 216 fatalities seen on May 18, as more people are vaccinated. On Sunday, Japan reported 22,302 COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Boss' 'paramour preference' not discrimination - 9th Circ,4083,"The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. (Reuters) - A Dignity Health research doctor did not engage in sex discrimination by allegedly showing favoritism toward a female researcher whom he was dating, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joining the seven other appeals courts to consider the issue, held that an employer who exhibits preferential treatment toward a supervisor's sexual or romantic partner is not liable for sex bias under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The panel rejected claims by William Maner, a former Dignity lab researcher, that the word ""sex"" in Title VII refers not only to gender but to sexual activity and that so-called ""paramour preference"" was a form of unlawful sexual harassment. ""The employer discriminates in favor of a supervisor’s sexual or romantic partner and against all other employees because they are not the favored paramour, no matter the sex of the paramour or of the complaining employees,"" Circuit Judge Carlos Bea wrote. San Francisco-based Dignity and its lawyers at Greenberg Traurig did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Carolyn Kubitschek of Lansner & Kubitschek, who represents Maner. Maner worked as a biomedical design engineer in the obstetric and gynecological laboratory of Dr. Robert Garfield for several decades, according to filings in the case. After Garfield moved his lab to the University of Texas in 1999, Maner learned that Garfield and a female lab employee were engaged in a long-term romantic relationship, according to court filings. In 2008, Garfield relocated his lab to a Dignity facility in Phoenix and arranged for his team to be transferred. At the time, Maner was facing charges of sexually assaulting his 7-year-old daughter. Maner denied the charges but pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. He was sentenced to eight years of probation, the terms of which required him to reside in Texas, according to filings. Garfield in 2010 approved a remote work arrangement for Maner allowing him to work from Texas, and the lab soon after lost some of its funding. Garfield gave Maner a highly negative performance review in 2011 and recommended that he return to Phoenix immediately or be terminated, according to court filings. Maner was fired a few months later. Maner in 2016 sued Dignity in Phoenix federal court, claiming Garfield had shielded his romantic partner from the impacts of reduced lab funding by firing Maner. U.S. District Judge David Campbell in 2018 granted summary judgment to Dignity, finding that Maner's claims were based not on his sex but on Garfield's preference for his romantic partner. Maner appealed, arguing that the term ""sex"" broadly encompasses sexual activity and not just sexual characteristics, but the 9th Circuit on Friday disagreed. To determine whether an employer discriminated based on sex, Bea wrote, the key question is whether changing the employee's sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer. But Garfield's alleged favoritism toward his partner would not have changed had Maner been a woman, the judge said. The 2nd Circuit in the 1986 case DeCintio v. Westchester County Medical Center first held that ""paramour preference"" did not violate Title VII, and the 9th Circuit on Friday became the seventh appeals court to follow suit. The panel included Circuit Judges William Fletcher and Michelle Friedland. The case is Maner v. Dignity Health, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-17159.

Swedish Health Agency sees COVID-19 spreading faster in coming months,1735,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Sweden is likely to see COVID-19 infections gain momentum in the coming months while the current curbs to limit the spread will need to be maintained until a higher proportion of the adult population is vaccinated, the Health Agency said on Monday. Sweden, which has opted against lockdowns and mostly relied on voluntary measures, has experienced a lull in the pandemic during the summer with few deaths and hospitalisations. However, cases have risen in recent weeks and that trend is expected to continue as schools reopen and people return to work. ""All our three scenarios point to increased spread during the autumn,"" the Health Agency said in a statement. ""More people are assumed to need hospital and intensive care, but at significantly lower levels than before during the pandemic."" While infections have been lower during summer, the rapid spread of the highly infectious Delta variant has seen authorities urge Swedes to remain on their guard, especially as colder weather forces people indoors. It said that current restrictions and recommendations, mainly to limit social interactions, isolate if sick and work from home if possible, should be kept in place until more people had received COVID jabs. Around 65% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. ""When the vaccination coverage rate is high enough so that healthcare does not risk being overloaded the Public Health Agency considers it reasonable to phase out most infection control measures, despite a spread of the virus,"" it said. Sweden has seen significantly higher deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours during the pandemic but lower than in most European countries. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"For first time since July, China reports no new local COVID-19 cases",3789,"BEIJING, Aug 23 (Reuters) - China reported no new locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 on Monday for the first time since July, a sign the current outbreak may be waning amid Beijing's 'zero-tolerance' stance and tough anti-virus measures across the country. More than 1,200 people have been confirmed infected in an outbreak that officials said has been mainly driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, which was brought in from abroad and caused a cluster in late July in the eastern city of Nanjing. No deaths have been reported in the outbreak. But it spurred authorities across the country to impose counter-epidemic measures including mass testing for millions of people to identify and isolate carriers, as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees. Economists have said they expect to see those steps cutting into growth in the world's second-biggest economy in the quarter ending September. Across China, new daily local cases fell to the single-digit level last week, after peaking in early August. Since the weekend, authorities have lifted lockdowns in a few areas in Beijing, as well as in the cities Wuhan and Jingmen in central Hubei province, after these cities had sealed up some areas to contain the virus. Sichuan has allowed travel agencies to resume tours to outside the province, barring places still deemed of risk. By contrast, Shanghai placed hundreds of people under quarantine over the weekend after some fresh infections were reported, sparking concerns of a fresh outbreak in the city. Still, Shanghai reported no new local infections for Aug. 22. read more ACCUSTOMED TO DISRUPTION Experts do not expect China to alter its zero-tolerance playbook in the near future - even when facing just a handful of local infections.

Philippine authorities have said the vaccine rollout is key to the recovery of the Southeast Asian country's economy. The Philippines was one of the fastest growing economies in Asia before the pandemic, but contracted by a record 9.6% in 2020.

Taiwan's president leads way in first domestic COVID-19 vaccine,3380,"TAIPEI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - President Tsai Ing-wen got vaccinated with Taiwan's first domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, giving her personal stamp of approval as the island begins rolling out the shot whose approval critics say has been rushed.

Tsai, who had held off using vaccines from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) or AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), the current mainstay of Taiwan's vaccination programme, received her Medigen shot at a hospital in central Taipei, demonstrating her confidence in the safety of the vaccine. Tsai chatted to medical workers as they prepared her shot, the whole process being broadcast live on her Facebook page, and gave a short response of ""no"" to a shouted question from reporters about whether she was nervous. ""It doesn't hurt, I'm in good spirits, and I'm going to continue working for the day,"" she later wrote on Facebook. The government says the initial experience of the pandemic last year, when basic supplies such as face masks were in short supply, made it realise they had to be able to rely on themselves for critical materials. Medigen, whose Chinese name literally means ""high-end"", rejects claims its vaccine is either unsafe or that it has been sent to market with undue haste, saying it is effective and well tested. ""We have done so many experiments, everyone has seen how safe our vaccine is,"" Medigen's Chief Executive Officer Charles Chen told Reuters.

"Biden pledges evacuation support, Taliban beat back crowds at airport",5484,"KABUL/WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The United States has an unwavering commitment to getting U.S. citizens and at-risk Afghans out of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden said, as Taliban fighters beat back thousands desperate to flee outside Kabul airport on Sunday. Biden said the security situation in Afghanistan was changing rapidly and his administration was under no illusions about the threat from Islamic State militants in Afghanistan known as ISIS-K (for Khorasan). The Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after a 20-year war, fired in the air and used batons to force people to form queues outside the airport, witnesses said. On Saturday, seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates. A NATO official said at least 20 people had died in the past seven days in and around the airport. Some were shot and others died in stampedes, witnesses have said. ""Let me be clear, the evacuation of thousands from Kabul is going to be hard and painful"" and would have been ""no matter when it began,"" Biden said in a briefing at the White House. ""We have a long way to go and a lot could still go wrong."" Biden said he had directed the State Department to contact Americans stranded in Afghanistan by phone, email and other means, and the United States had a plan to move them to the airport. ""We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound. For security reasons, I'm not going to go into detail ... but I will say again today what I've said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home."" Afghan allies of the West and vulnerable Afghans such as women activists and journalists would be helped too, he said. On Sunday, there were no major injuries as gunmen beat back the crowds, according to witnesses. The Taliban had been ""cooperative"" about extending the airport perimeter, Biden said. Asked by a reporter whether the United States would extend an Aug. 31 deadline for evacuations, Biden replied: ""Our hope is we will not have to extend but there are going to be discussions I suspect on how far along we are in the process."" CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT The United States on Sunday sought the help of six commercial airlines to transport people after their evacuation from Afghanistan.

Biden said he would support that effort, depending on the conduct of the Taliban. Panicked Afghans have tried to board flights out of Kabul since last weekend, fearing reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law the Sunni Muslim group exercised while in power two decades ago. Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government. OPPOSITION They face opposition from forces in northern Afghanistan, which said this weekend they had taken three districts close to the Panjshir valley. Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Massoud said on Sunday he hoped to hold peaceful talks with the Islamist movement but that his forces in the Panjshir - remnants of army units, special forces and militiamen - were ready to fight. ""We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation,"" he said. ""We do not want a war to break out."" The Taliban said hundreds of their fighters were heading towards Panjshir, showing a video on Twitter of a column of captured trucks with the white Taliban flag but still bearing their government markings moving along a highway. The United States and other countries including Britain have brought in several thousand troops to help evacuate foreign citizens and at-risk Afghans from Kabul, but have been careful to avoid clashes with the Taliban. A Taliban official said: ""We are seeking complete clarity on foreign forces' exit plan"". Taliban political office spokesman Mohammed Naeem told Saudi-owned Al Hadath TV that talks are ongoing with the United States and other countries. He said al Qaeda is not present in Afghanistan and the Taliban has no relationship with it. Afghans who fled in the past week have spoken about their despair at leaving loved ones behind. ""It was very difficult to leave,"" a veiled woman told Reuters in Qatar. ""I love my country."" The World Health Organization and U.N. children's agency UNICEF called for a humanitarian air bridge to deliver aid to Afghanistan to help more than 18 million people in need. U.S. Army Major General William Taylor said on Saturday that the United States in the past week had evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, from Kabul. On one of the flights, an Afghan woman gave birth on board moments after landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Saturday, the U.S. Air Force said on Twitter. The woman delivered a baby girl in the cargo bay of a C-17 aircraft. The mother and baby were in good condition, the tweet said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Turkey reinforces border to block any Afghan migrant wave,4418,"VAN, Turkey, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Afghans who manage to make the weeks-long journey through Iran on foot to the Turkish border face a three-metre high wall, ditches or barbed wire as Turkish authorities step up efforts to block any refugee influx into the country. The beefed up border measures in Turkey, which already hosts nearly 4 million Syrian refugees and is a staging post for many migrants trying to reach Europe, began as the Taliban started advancing in Afghanistan and took over Kabul last week. Authorities plan to add another 64 km by the end of the year to a border wall started in 2017. Ditches, wire and security patrols around the clock will cover the rest of the 560 km frontier. ""We want to show the whole world that our borders are unpassable,"" Mehmet Emin Bilmez, governor of the eastern border province of Van, told Reuters at the weekend. ""Our biggest hope is that there is no migrant wave from Afghanistan."" Turkey is not the only country putting up barriers: Its neighbour Greece has just completed a 40-km fence and surveillance system to keep out migrants who still manage to enter Turkey and try to reach the European Union. read more Authorities say there are 182,000 registered Afghan migrants in Turkey and up to an estimated 120,000 unregistered ones. President Tayyip Erdogan urged European countries to take responsibility for any new influx, warning that Turkey had no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The number of irregular Afghan migrants detained in Turkey so far this year is less than a fifth of the number detained in 2019, and officials say they have not yet seen signs of a major surge since last week's Taliban victory, though the long distances mean refugees could take weeks to arrive. The Turkish side of the mountainous border with Iran is lined by bases and watchtowers. Patrol cars monitor around the clock for movement on the Iranian side, from where migrants, smugglers and Kurdish militants frequently try to cross into Turkey. Migrants who are spotted getting through at the border are returned to the Iranian side, though most return and try again, according to security forces. ""No matter how many high-level measures you take, there may be those who evade them from time to time,"" Bilmez said. A migrant family from Afghanistan, caught by Turkish security forces after crossing illegally into Turkey from Iran, is pictured in a room at a migrant processing centre in the border city of Van, Turkey August 22, 2021. REUTERS/Murad Sezer 'LET US STAY' Roads leading from the border are lined with checkpoints. Migrants who make it through are hidden by smugglers in houses - often dirty, ramshackle buildings underground or in deep dried riverbeds - waiting to be moved to western Turkey. On Saturday police captured 25 migrants, mostly Afghans, behind a dilapidated building in Van's Hacibekir neighbourhood. ""We thought we will have facilities here, we will earn to support our parents. There, there are Taliban to kill us,"" said 20-year-old Zaynullah, one of those detained. He said he arrived in Turkey two days earlier after travelling on foot for 80 days. Those captured are taken for health and security checks at a processing centre. There Seyyed Fahim Mousavi, a 26-year-old, said he fled his home in Kabul a month ago, before the Taliban came, fearing they would kill him because he had worked as a driver for the Americans and Turks. His 22-year-old wife, Morsal, said they took the journey through Iran mostly on foot to escape the Taliban. ""They harm women. After raping them, they kill them. They behead the men,"" she said, holding her two children, aged two and five. ""We don't want to go back. Just let us stay here."" After processing, migrants are taken to a repatriation centre, where they can spend up to 12 months before being sent back to their home country. Those repatriations have been halted for Afghans now, leaving around 7,500 Afghans in limbo in various repatriation centres. Ramazan Secilmis, deputy head of the migration directorate, said his organisation was working to identify those who need protection from the Taliban to relocate them to third countries. ""Those who need protection need to be separated from those who come to our country due to economic reasons. We cannot deport anyone automatically just because they have Afghan nationality,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
N.Korea develops its own PCR equipment for COVID-19 tests -state media,1595,"SEOUL, Aug 23 (Reuters) - North Korea has developed its own Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment to conduct coronavirus tests, state media said on Monday, as the country steps up efforts to head off more contagious new strains of the virus. The isolated country has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but has sealed borders, restricted travel and imposed strict prevention measures, seeing the pandemic as a matter of national survival. As part of the anti-virus efforts, scientists and technicians at the State Academy of Sciences have developed the PCR system that meets global standards for the first time, said the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Worker's Party's newspaper. The equipment was introduced as one of recent achievements made under leader Kim Jong Un's push to localise machinery, tools and materials amid international sanctions and border closures that sharply reduced trade. North Korea has run PCR tests as an internationally recognised standard COVID-19 diagnostic method, but received outside assistance including from the World Health Organization (WHO). The official KCNA news agency also said on Monday that North Korea is stepping up its battle against the virus to ward off the highly transmissible Delta and Lambda variants spreading around the world. ""Plans are under way to normalise disinfection and prevent disorderly movement of people and supplies at offices and workplaces, while education and control is being intensified to ensure all people obey rules including wearing masks at public spaces,"" KCNA said.

"Exit polls show ally of Japan's Suga losing Yokohama election, NHK says",1921,"TOKYO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - An ally of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was set to lose a mayoral race in Yokohama on Sunday, public broadcaster NHK said, citing exit polls, in a blow for the unpopular premier who faces a general election this year. Exit polls pointed to a clear victory for the opposition-backed professor of public health Takeharu Yamanaka, NHK said. The field of eight candidates included politician Hachiro Okonogi, who ran with Suga's backing, as well as incumbent mayor Fumiko Hayashi. Polls closed at 8:00 p.m. local time (1100 GMT). The projected loss for Okonogi on the premier's home turf just south of Tokyo is likely to pile more pressure on Suga, who was already under fire over surging COVID-19 cases and a perception that he has been clumsy in handling the pandemic. Suga's approval ratings slid below 30% in August, fanning concerns in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party about his ability to lead the party into a general election that must be held by Nov. 28. Suga, who took office last September after predecessor Shinzo Abe quit citing ill health, is struggling to contain the pandemic, with national daily infections hitting a record 25,000 last week. Although Yokohama is in Suga's constituency in parliament, a survey conducted by a local newspaper in mid-August found Okonogi trailing Yamanaka, reflecting concerns over the government's handling of the pandemic. Kanagawa, the prefecture where Yokohama is located, has been under a state of emergency since Aug. 2, but infections have continued to rise. The prefecture recorded a record 2,878 cases on Friday, according to public broadcaster NHK. Suga's term as LDP president ends in September. He can either be re-elected uncontested or face a party vote if other candidates emerge to challenge him for the job.

Swedish PM to step down in November ahead of 2022 elections,2909,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven caught many off guard on Sunday, saying he would resign in November ahead of a general election in September 2022 to give his successor a chance to improve the Social Democrats' standing in the polls. Lofven has been prime minister since 2014, heading two coalition governments with the Green Party that have lurched from crisis to crisis, unable to command a majority in parliament. The most recent setback saw Lofven, a former welder and union leader, resign in June after losing a no-confidence vote. He was returned to office by parliament in July when the leader of the biggest opposition party, the Moderates, failed to get enough backing to form a new government. read more ""In next year's election campaign the Social Democrats will be led by someone else than me,"" Lofven said at the end of his annual summer speech. ""Everything has an end and I want to give my successor the very best conditions."" He said he would step down at the party's congress in November. Lofven's Social Democrats have dominated Swedish politics for generations, but their support - like that of left-of-centre parties across much of Europe - has gradually eroded. In addition, the rise of the Sweden Democrats, a populist, anti-immigration party, has made forming majority governments almost impossible. The Social Democrats will probably benefit ahead of the elections from having a new leader, Uppsala University political scientist Torsten Svensson told Reuters. ""The fact he takes the initiative himself, not resigning after explicit demands for it, and the fact they get to launch the election campaign with a new face is a big plus,"" he said. Lofven's possible successors include current Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, Health Minister Lena Hallengren and Minister of the Interior Mikael Damberg, he said. Lofven took over the leadership of the Social Democrats in 2012, when their support was at an all-time low and managed to return them to power after eight years of centre-right rule. He got a second term in 2018, but only when two centre-right parties swapped sides, leaving Lofven caught between their demands and those of the Left Party, whose support he has also needed. His successor is likely to have similar problems as opinion polls show the centre-right and centre-left blocs still deadlocked. The government currently does not have the support it will need to pass a budget in the autumn. Magnus Hagevi, political scientist at the Linnaeus University, said the resignation was not a surprise considering that Lofven had been on the job for a long time. ""He does this at a time that gives the successor a chance to step into his shoes ahead of the next parliamentary election,"" he said, adding that possible successors include Energy Minister Anders Ygeman as well as Andersson.

"Saudi Arabia pledges to provide support for Tunisia, Tunisian presidency says",1651,"TUNIS, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia pledged on Sunday to provide assistance to Tunisia, which is suffering a political, economic and health crisis, the Tunisian presidency said on Sunday, the latest sign of support for President Kais Saied against his Islamist opponents. Saudi State Minister for African Affairs Ahmed Abdul Aziz Kattan met Saied in Tunis and senior officials held talks afterward to discuss cooperation, the presidency said in a statement. Saied last month dismissed his prime minister, froze parliament and assumed executive authority in a sudden intervention that his Islamist opponents have labeled a coup but that he said was necessary to save the country from collapse. The statement did not give any details of the assistance that could be provided by Saudi Arabia, which has reiterated that it supports Saied's decisions aimed at protecting the country. Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz said earlier this month that his country would give Tunisia one million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and Saudi has also established an air bridge to provide medical aid for the North Africa country. Tunisia is struggling with an unprecedented fiscal deficit, which reached 11.4% last year. It is also on the verge of bankruptcy, needing at least $3 billion this year to pay off foreign debts and the wages of hundreds of thousands of employees in the public sector. Some Gulf states saw Saied's intervention as undermining the Muslim Brotherhood movement, which they regard as their main regional foe, and which is close to the biggest party in Tunisia's now frozen parliament.

South Korea to get more Moderna COVID shots in boost to vaccination effort,1727,"SEOUL, Aug 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's health ministry said on Sunday that Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) will supply the country with 7.01 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by the first week of September, following a government request to speed up delivery. Some 1.01 million doses are expected to arrive on Monday, the ministry said, with another 6 million to be supplied sequentially. Moderna delivered 1.3 million doses earlier this month. It had at the time informed South Korea that it would only be able to deliver less than half the 8.5 million doses it had been due to ship in August. read more ""In response to our request to speed up and expand the vaccine supply, Moderna informed us that it will supply 7.01 million doses by the first week of September,"" the ministry said in a statement. Under the plan, the country will be able to give 36 million people at least one dose of the vaccine before the Sept. 20-22 Chuseok holiday. The statement also said that the government is currently in talks with Romania for a vaccine swap deal, but denied a local media report that said the Romanian government approved donation of 450,000 doses of Moderna vaccines. It gave no details of the planned swap, saying more information on the discussion with Romania will be provided as soon as it is finalised. On Saturday South Korea reported 1,628 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 236,366. A total of 2,215 people have died so far.

Australian PM Morrison defends lockdown strategy as daily cases hit record,2950,"MELBOURNE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Australia will stick to its lockdown strategy against the coronavirus until at least 70% of its population is fully vaccinated, but after that it will have to start living with the virus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday. The country set a record with 914 infections, its highest daily figure, as the southern and eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory remain under a strict lockdown. ""You can't live with lockdowns forever and at some point, you need to make that gear change, and that is done at 70%,"" Morrison said in a television interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corp's Insider program. Lockdowns are a key element of the federal government's strategy to rein in outbreaks until the 70% percent level is reached, with borders being re-opened gradually when the figure climbs to 80%. read more . But in a departure from the zero-COVID strategy adopted since the pandemic began, Morrison said it was highly unlikely for Australia to reach zero cases before curbs can be eased. ""Lockdowns are not a sustainable way to deal with the virus and that's why we have to get to the 70% and 80% marks, so we can start living with the virus,"" he added. About 60% of the population of 25 million is now under lockdown. Stay-at-home orders, often lasting for months, have taxed the patience of many.

New South Wales saw 830 new infections on Sunday, despite stepped-up efforts, and the Australian Capital Territory, home to the capital, Canberra, had 19.

""We are throwing everything at this,"" said Martin Foley, the state's health minister. Just about 30% of Australians older than 16 have been fully vaccinated, health ministry data showed on Saturday. This is mainly because the Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine is in short supply and the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine provokes public unease.

Israeli aircraft strike Hamas sites in Gaza after border clashes,2845,"TEL AVIV, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck Hamas sites in Gaza late on Saturday, the military said, in an escalation of hostilities after earlier cross-border gunfire seriously injured an Israeli soldier and wounded 41 Palestinians, including two critically. The injuries came during a Gaza protest organised by the enclave's Islamist rulers Hamas and other factions in support of Jerusalem, where Palestinian clashes with Israeli police helped spark an 11-day Israel-Hamas conflict in May. Hundreds of Palestinians gathered near the Strip's heavily fortified border, where some tried to scale the border fence and others threw explosives towards Israeli troops, the Israeli military said. ""IDF (Israeli military) troops responded with riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire,"" it said in a statement. Among the two Palestinians critically injured was a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the head, Gaza's health ministry said. It described most of the other injuries as moderate, including gun shots to limbs, backs and abdomens. Cross-border fire from Gaza seriously wounded an Israeli border police soldier, who is in hospital receiving medical treatment, the military said. There was no claim of responsibility for the Gaza gunfire. In response to the soldier's shooting, Israeli ""fighter jets have struck four weapons storage and manufacturing sites belonging to"" Hamas, the military said. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Bracing for more hostilities, the military said it had sent additional forces to the Gaza border area. Israeli media reported the military had increased deployment of its Iron Dome anti-missile system. The violence follows an Israeli announcement of a resumption of Qatari aid to Gaza, a move seen as bolstering a fragile Egyptian-mediated truce to the May fighting. read more Just days before that announcement, Gaza militants launched a rocket towards Israel that was shot down by the Iron Dome, in the first such attack since the truce. read more Palestinians have also sporadically launched fire-laden balloons towards Israel since the fighting, drawing Israeli strikes on Hamas sites. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Saturday's air strikes showed Israel was ""trying to cover up its failure and disappointment in front of the steadfastness of our people and their valiant resistance."" At least 250 Palestinians and 13 in Israel were killed in the May conflict, in which Gaza militants fired rockets towards Israeli cities and Israel carried out air strikes across the coastal enclave. Israel keeps Gaza under a blockade, tightly restricting movement out of the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians. Egypt also maintains restrictions on the enclave.

Protesters in France demonstrate against COVID pass for sixth weekend,1511,"PARIS, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Thousands demonstrated across France for a sixth consecutive weekend on Saturday against a COVID-19 health pass required for daily activities, highlighting a simmering political risk for President Emmanuel Macron. The Interior Ministry said around 175,500 people in total demonstrated on Saturday - down from roughly 215,000 last weekend although numbers could increase as people return from summer holidays. The health pass is official documentation, with a QR scan code, that proves a person has had the COVID-19 vaccine. Many French bars, restaurants, museums and sports venues will not allow people inside unless they can show the health pass. While the majority of people in France have been vaccinated against COVID-19, demonstrators argue the health pass discriminates against those who have not, and infringes upon people's liberties. ""This health pass divides French people. I think that is clear. And unfortunately, I believe we should abolish it,"" said civil servant Sophie Soulas at the Paris protest. The protests have united a disparate group against the health pass, which is designed to encourage more people to get vaccinated and protect France against a fourth wave of the virus. The biggest demonstration in Paris was led by far-right politician Florian Philippot, head of 'Les Patriotes' party, while there was also a demonstration by left-wing protesters linked to the 'Yellow Vests' ('Gilets Jaunes') movement.

Police arrest hundreds of protesters as Australia reports record COVID-19 cases,3523,"MELBOURNE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australian police arrested hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters in Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday and seven officers were hospitalised as a result of clashes, as the country saw its highest ever single-day rise in COVID-19 cases. Mounted police used pepper spray in Melbourne to break up crowds of more than 4,000 surging toward police lines, while smaller groups of protesters were prevented from congregating in Sydney by a large contingent of riot police. Victoria state police said that they arrested 218 people in the state capital Melbourne. They issued 236 fines and kept three people in custody for assaulting police. The arrested people face fines of A$5,452 ($3,900) each for breaching public health orders. Police in New South Wales, where Sydney is the capital, said they charged 47 people with breaching public health orders or resisting arrest, among other offences, and issued more than 260 fines ranging from A$50 ($35) to $3,000. The police said about 250 people made it to the city for the protest. Sydney, Australia's biggest city with more than 5 million people, has been in a strict lockdown for more than two months, failing to contain an outbreak that has spread across internal borders and as far as neighbouring New Zealand. The vast majority of the 894 cases reported across Australia on Saturday were found in Sydney, the epicentre of the Delta variant-fuelled outbreak. ""We are in a very serious situation here in New South Wales,"" said state Health Minister Brad Hazzard. ""There is no time now to be selfish, it's time to think of the broader community and your families."" Police patrolled Sydney's streets and blocked private and public transport into the city centre to reduce the number of people gathering at an unauthorised protest. In Melbourne, the country's second-most populous city, a large crowd managed to march and some clashed with police, after state Premier Daniel Andrews expanded a city lockdown to the entire state. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier warned people to stay away from the protest, adding it was ""just ridiculous to think that people would be so selfish and come and do this."" Several hundred people also protested peacefully in Brisbane, which is not in lockdown. Just 7% of Australians support the often-violent protests, according to a late-July poll by market research firm Utting Research. Compliance with public health rules has been one of the key cited reasons behind Australia's success, relative to other rich countries, in managing the pandemic. But the country has been struggling to rein in the third wave of infections that began in Sydney in mid-June. Australia has had about 43,000 COVID-19 cases and 978 deaths. But while those numbers are low, only about a third of Australians aged 16 and above have been fully vaccinated, according to federal health ministry data released on Saturday. New South Wales officials reported three deaths and 516 people in hospital on Saturday. Of the 85 people in intensive care, 76 were unvaccinated, officials said. At least 96 people were active in the community during their infectious period, and there were a number of breaches of public health orders, all slowing the efforts to curtail the outbreak. In Victoria, at least 39 people were active in the community while infectious. Eighteen people were in hospital, eight in intensive care and six on ventilators.

Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier warned people to stay away from the protest, adding it was ""just ridiculous to think that people would be so selfish and come and do this."" Several hundred people also protested peacefully in Brisbane, which is not in lockdown. Just 7% of Australians support the often-violent protests, according to a late-July poll by market research firm Utting Research. Compliance with public health rules has been one of the key cited reasons behind Australia's success, relative to other rich countries, in managing the pandemic. But the country has been struggling to rein in the third wave of infections that began in Sydney in mid-June. Australia has had about 43,000 COVID-19 cases and 978 deaths. But while those numbers are low, only about a third of Australians aged 16 and above have been fully vaccinated, according to federal health ministry data released on Saturday. New South Wales officials reported three deaths and 516 people in hospital on Saturday. Of the 85 people in intensive care, 76 were unvaccinated, officials said. At least 96 people were active in the community during their infectious period, and there were a number of breaches of public health orders, all slowing the efforts to curtail the outbreak. In Victoria, at least 39 people were active in the community while infectious. Eighteen people were in hospital, eight in intensive care and six on ventilators.

Daily infections have more than doubled in a month to an average of 3,897, according to the Reuters Global COVID tracker. Hospitals in the country of 22 million people are overflowing with COVID-19 patients as the highly transmissible Delta variant surges through the population. ""If they listen to us it will be good for our leaders and for the country,"" said lawmaker Tissa Witarana, a supporter of a strict national lockdown, before the health minister's announcement. Many restrictions are already in place, with schools, gyms, and swimming pools closed and weddings and musical shows banned. Authorities also imposed a night curfew from Monday, restricting movement from 10 pm until 4 am every day. Around a quarter of Sri Lanka's population has been fully vaccinated, a majority of them with China's Sinopharm vaccine. Sri Lanka has also approved the Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O), AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Russia's Sputnik V shots.

Panic buying in Vietnam's largest city before tighter COVID-19 lockdown,1685,"HANOI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Vietnam's plan to prohibit residents of Ho Chi Minh City from leaving their homes from Monday has triggered panic buying in the epicentre of its worst coronavirus outbreak. The scramble for purchases is hurting efforts in the nation's largest city to contain the spiralling COVID-19 outbreak, said the official Vietnam News Agency. Long queues of people were seen outside markets and shelves at supermarkets in Ho Chi Minh City were emptying on Saturday, witnesses and state media said. ""It's looking chaotic,"" said a person who gave her name only as Nguyen in the city's District 2. ""Too many people are rushing out to buy food and essential stuff for their hard days ahead,"" she told Reuters. ""I have managed to by some food, as I don't want to die from hunger before dying from coronavirus."" Vietnam said on Friday it would also deploy troops in the city to enforce the lockdown and deliver food supplies to citizens, as the city turns to drastic measures to slow a spiralling rate of coronavirus deaths. read more Vietnam has recorded 323,000 coronavirus infections and 7,540 deaths, with Ho Chi Minh City accounting for more than half of the cases and 80% of the fatalities, according to the health ministry. ""The city is ready with measures to supply food and essential goods for the residents,"" Phan Van Mai, deputy head of the city's coronavirus task force was quoted as saying. Vietnam's ruling Communist Party on Friday announced a decision to replace Nguyen Thanh Phong as chairman of the city's People's Committee.

Singapore says ASEAN not as effective as hoped in Myanmar,3501,"SINGAPORE, Aug 20(Reuters) - The progress by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Myanmar has not been as effective as hoped, Singapore's foreign minister said in an interview. The United Nations and many countries have urged ASEAN, whose 10 members include Myanmar, to restore stability through diplomacy. ""(ASEAN is) not as effective or as quick as we would have hoped for. But this is a difficult situation,"" Vivian Balakrishnan told Reuters. In April, ASEAN announced a five-point consensus aimed at resolving the crisis. As part of those efforts, the bloc appointed Brunei's second minister for foreign affairs as special envoy to Myanmar in early August. read more Balakrishnan said he hoped there would be progress to report on the envoy's visit before the ASEAN leaders' summit in November. But he cautioned that the military had to grant the envoy access to all stakeholders for the visit to be meaningful. ""The key litmus test now will be how they engage with our special envoy,"" Balakrishnan said. The death toll as a result of Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup topped 1,000 this week, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group, which has been recording killings by security forces. read more Myanmar's economy has collapsed and a humanitarian crisis worsened in the past month as coronavirus infections surged, overwhelming the health system.

""We have maintained lines of communication,"" Balakrishnan said, when asked whether ASEAN or Singapore had engaged with the shadow National Unity Government. ""We're not trying to make things difficult. And we're not playing sides. But (military authorities) know we will engage everyone."" Singapore is small but wields strong economic and political influence in Southeast Asia. Some rights groups say Singapore has leverage in Myanmar thanks to its close ties with country as one of its biggest investors. The city-state had a cumulative $24.1 billion of investments approved there as of 2020, according to official Myanmar data since 1988. That made it the biggest source of foreign capital there, ahead of China. However, Balakrishnan said Singapore's ""so-called leverage was overestimated"", because the total also included multinationals that have invested in Myanmar. He said economic sanctions would ordinary people but have a limited effect on the military authorities, who can better withstand isolation. There has been no discussion within ASEAN about expelling or suspending Myanmar, the minister said, adding that the bloc wanted to be constructive but did not want to interfere in domestic politics. He was speaking to Reuters two days ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris's trip to Vietnam and Singapore.

Uzbekistan accepts 400 more refugees from Afghanistan - Russian state media,891,"MOSCOW, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan has accepted about 400 more refugees from Afghanistan and put them up in temporary accommodation near the Afghan border, the Russian state news agency TASS reported on Saturday, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter. It is unclear how many Afghans have crossed into the former Soviet republic as Taliban insurgents overran Afghanistan. The Tashkent government has denied that senior Afghan figures such as ethnic Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dustum were among them. However, approximately 650 Afghan officers from units commanded by Dustum were already at the same health centre, TASS cited the source as saying.

UNICEF warns millions of Lebanese face water shortages,977,"BEIRUT, Aug 21 (Reuters) - More than 4 million people in Lebanon could face a critical shortage of water or be cut off completely in the coming days, UNICEF warned, due to a severe fuel crisis. Lebanon, with a population of 6 million, is at a low point in a two-year financial meltdown, with a lack of fuel oil and gasoline meaning extensive blackouts and long lines at the few gas stations still operating. ""Vital facilities such as hospitals and health centres have been without access to safe water due to electricity shortages, putting lives at risk,"" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement. ""If four million people are forced to resort to unsafe and costly sources of water, public health and hygiene will be compromised, and Lebanon could see an increase in waterborne diseases, in addition to the surge in COVID-19 cases,"" she said, urging the formation of a new government to tackle the crisis.

Malaysia's new PM takes office amid mounting health crisis,2475,"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Malaysia swore in a new prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, on Saturday as the Southeast Asian nation battles its worst COVID-19 surge and public anger grows over mismanagement of the pandemic. The appointment of Ismail Sabri, 61, restores the role to a party tainted by graft accusations, after he secured a parliamentary majority from the same alliance that collapsed this week and replaced Muhyiddin Yassin. Ismail Sabri, formerly Muhyiddin's deputy, was sworn in at the national palace after beingpicked by King Al-Sultan Abdullah, the constitutional monarch. He took the oath of office in front of the monarch and other coalition leaders, including former prime minister Najib Razak. King Al-Sultan Abdullah has previously said the new prime minister would have to face a confidence vote in parliament to prove his majority. read more Ismail Sabri starts his job at a time when Malaysia's infections and deaths relative to population rank as southeast Asia's highest. An online petition started this week drew 350,000 signatories opposing Ismail Sabri's appointment, citing his handling of the pandemic. Friday's 23,564 cases were a record for a third straight day, taking the tally beyond 1.5 million. Public anger has grown as infections spread despite multiple extended lockdowns and ramped up vaccinations. Since last month, Malaysians in need have hoisted white flags at their homes to seek public help. read more Although Malaysia escaped the worst of the pandemic last year, a regional election led to a steady spike in infections since the fourth quarter of 2020, with the Delta variant worsening the situation in recent months. Flip-flops on lockdown measures, failure to act against politicians who violated rules and months of politicking have soured the public. The pandemic has also dampened economic growth, with the central bank slashing its 2021 forecast twice this year. read more With Ismail Sabri in office the post is being returned to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which governed for more than six decades since independence, but was defeated in a 2018 election over a scandal at state fund 1MDB.

Some 120 people deemed close contacts of the infected five workers at Pudong Airport were placed into quarantine, along with hundreds of others deemed secondary contacts. Two of the cargo workers, a Chinese national and an Ethiopian national, were included among four locally transmitted cases in mainland China's tally of 20 new confirmed infections for Aug. 20, announced on Saturday. Another two local cases were found in Jiangsu and Hubei provinces. Separate, unrelated outbreaks first emerged in those regions in July. The national figure was down from 33 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission, with locally transmitted infections steady at four.

Philippines' Duterte orders payment of healthcare workers' benefits,1927,"MANILA, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the health and budget ministries to arrange payment for healthcare workers who have not received their benefits on time, following nurses' threats to resign and strike warnings by unions. Hospitals fear that desertions of medical staff, particularly nurses, have reached a critical point just as the Delta variant sends infections cases soaring, as it has elsewhere in Southeast Asia and globally. read more ""Pay them. Use whatever money there is,"" Duterte told Health Minister Franscisco Duque, who is facing questions over more than $1 billion in COVID-19 spending, including non-payment of medical workers' benefits. The order came after union leaders in hospitals in virus hot spots threatened last week to strike, while a nursing group said dozens could resign over unpaid risk allowances and hazard pay, adding pressure to facilities battling staff shortages. The Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines (PHAPi) estimated that 40% of private hospital nurses resigned last year, but more followed new waves of infections this year. Public hospitals face similar challenges. Duterte, in a recorded speech aired on Saturday, also gave the Department of Budget and Management 10 days to help settle unpaid benefits of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers in public and private hospitals.

"New Zealand reports 21 local COVID-19 cases, more expected",1699,"Aug 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand recorded 21 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warning the number will go higher in the next few days and urging the Pacific nation to adhere to the lockdown rules. The infections in the community outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant now total 51. Of the 21 new cases, 18 are in the largest city, Auckland, and three in the capital, Wellington. Ardern on Friday extended the lockdown for the country of 5.1 million until midnight on Tuesday as the outbreak widened beyond the two key cities. ""One of the things that we've learned from New South Wales is that the virus can continue to spread during lockdown,"" Ardern said of an outbreak in neighbouring Australia's most-populous state. New South Wales on Saturday logged a record 825 cases as a Delta outbreak surges despite weeks-long lockdown. read more ""No one wants an extended lockdown and no one wants to see that rate of transmission, so the number one thing everyone can do right now is reduce down your contacts,"" Ardern said. New Zealand's outbreak has been linked to a traveller from Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. New Zealanders had been living virus-free and without curbs until Ardern on Tuesday ordered what was initially a three-day nationwide lockdown and a seven-day shutdown for Auckland, after the discovery of the first case since February.

"Euro 2020 final at Wembley was a ""superspreader"" event",2152,"LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Euro 2020 soccer final between England and Italy in July was a ""superspreader"" event due to the level of COVID-19 infection found in or around London's Wembley Stadium on the day, according to official data published on Friday. Public Health England said 2,295 people were likely to have been infectious with a further 3,404 people potentially acquiring infection at the July 11 match. ""Euros final was superspreader event,"" declared the Times newspaper. The match, with a crowd of around 67,000 inside the stadium, was England's first final in an international soccer tournament since the country hosted and won the 1966 World Cup. ""Euro 2020 was a unique occasion and it is unlikely we would see a similar impact on COVID-19 cases from future events,"" said Jenifer Smith, Public Health England's deputy medical director, in a statement. ""However, the data does show how easily the virus can spread when there is close contact and this should be a warning to us all as we try and return to a cautious normality once again."" Other trial events over a four-month period showed far fewer positive tests, and were either broadly in line with or lower than national averages. The British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone in July drew a 350,000-strong crowd, the largest in Britain in more than 18 months, over three days and had 585 cases recorded by NHS Test and Trace. Of those cases, 343 were likely to have already been infectious around the time of the event and the rest likely to have acquired an infection then. The Wimbledon tennis championships, with around 300,000 people attending over the two weeks, recorded 881 cases.

Cuba grants emergency approval to second homegrown vaccine,1992,"HAVANA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Cuba's drug regulator granted emergency approval for its homegrown Soberana 2 vaccine on Friday, allowing the drug's full inclusion in the country's inoculation program as it races to curb a Delta variant-fueled coronavirus outbreak. The Soberana vaccine, which Cuba says has an efficacy rate of 91.2%, has already been used to vaccinate some health workers and ordinary citizens in areas with high rates of transmission as part of early intervention studies. Approval by the Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices means the drug, comprised of two initial shots and a booster, can be included in the national vaccine program and could also help licensing abroad. Cuba's healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the recent COVID-19 outbreak, struggling with a lack of oxygen, medicines, doctors and equipment. Just a quarter of the population of around 11 million has been fully vaccinated. The country currently has one of the highest rates of officially confirmed cases and deaths per capita in the world, even though it managed to keep both low for much of last year. The real numbers are likely even higher, according to reports from various provinces as the latest outbreak has outpaced its testing capacity. Health Minister Jose Angel Portal said this week the official death toll likely fell short because it only included people who had formally tested positive for COVID-19 before death, state-run newspaper Invasor reported. The Soberana 2 vaccine was approved last month for emergency use in Iran, which struck a deal with Cuba to produce the drug on an industrial scale in the Islamic republic. A second locally produced COVID-19 vaccine, Abdala, which Cuba says has a 92.28 % efficacy rate was approved by the Cuban regulator for use last month. Late phase clinical trial data showing efficacy rates for either vaccine has yet to be published in peer-reviewed journals. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Appeals court rejects latest bid to halt U.S. eviction moratorium,2229,"WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a bid by groups representing landlords to halt the latest moratorium on residential evictions imposed by President Joe Biden's administration, setting up a U.S. Supreme Court showdown. In a written order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency request by two chapters of the National Association of Realtors to stop the COVID-19 pandemic-related eviction ban set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The moratorium, implemented after a previous one lapsed at the end of July, is due to expire on Oct. 3. Realtor groups in Alabama and Georgia were among those challenging the moratorium. The appellate court's order sets the stage for the Supreme Court to hear arguments over whether the administration overstepped its authority by issuing the moratorium. A general view of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia September 30, 2014. REUTERS/Tami Chappell Hours after the order issued, the realtor groups asked the Supreme Court to issue an emergency order lifting the moratorium, saying in a court filing that ""Congress never gave the CDC the staggering amount of power it claims."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the Biden administration is ""pleased that the circuit court joined the district court in leaving the moratorium in place that is keeping hard-pressed Americans in their homes in areas of substantial or high COVID-19 spread."" Under heavy political pressure from Biden's fellow Democrats, his administration reversed course on Aug. 3 and issued a slightly narrower eviction moratorium three days after the prior one expired. Biden initially had said that congressional action was needed to renew the moratorium, but his administration reversed course. The current moratorium covers nearly 92% of U.S. counties, but that could change based on COVID-19 conditions. The CDC first issued a moratorium in September 2020 after a prior one approved by Congress expired, with agency officials saying the policy was needed to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic."
Florida Board of Education gives school districts ultimatum on masks,2384,"Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Florida Board of Education on Friday told two school districts they would have some of their state funding withheld if they failed within the next 48 hours to provide parents with a way to opt out of a requirement that their children wear masks. School boards in Broward and Alachua counties have mandated masks in schools in defiance of an executive order issued last month by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that barred local officials from imposing mask mandates. Like some other Republican governors, DeSantis has called mask-wearing a personal choice which, for students, should be made by parents. ""These are the initial consequences to their intentional refusal to follow state law and state rule to purposefully and willingly violate the rights of parents,"" Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran said in a statement on Friday. The order was the latest development in the raging debate over mask-wearing in some U.S. states where the coronavirus further exposed deep political fault lines. Earlier this week, the state Board of Education voted unanimously to punish the two counties for mandating masks. It said on Friday that both school districts will be required to provide the commissioner of education with information regarding the salaries of school board members within 48 hours, with the intent of cutting their pay. The Florida Department of Education ""will then begin to withhold from state funds, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to 1/12 of the total annual compensation of the school board members who voted to impose the unlawful mask mandates until each district demonstrates compliance,"" the statement said. In a tweet, President Joe Biden expressed solidarity with the two school districts. ""American Rescue Plan funds can be used to backfill the salaries of the brave Florida school board members, superintendents, and other educators keeping our children safe,"" he wrote. Florida is battling a resurgence of COVID-19 spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant, which is spreading infections mostly among the unvaccinated. Coronavirus hospitalizations have increased by 28% in the past two weeks, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

U.S. FDA aims to give full approval to Pfizer vaccine on Monday -NYT,2232,"WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to give full approval to Pfizer's (PFE.N) COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, the New York Times reported on Friday. Regulators were aiming to complete the process by Friday, but were still working through ""a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company,"" the Times said, citing people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The agency declined to comment. It had set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day on Sept. 6, the report said. The approval could boost the vaccination campaign by convincing more unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective and also make local officials more comfortable in implementing vaccine mandates. read more The U.S. military is expected to require that service members get vaccinated soon after Pfizer's shot is authorized and other major U.S. employers could follow suit. read more Vaccine hesitancy has been a major hurdle to the White House's goal of getting all eligible Americans vaccinated against the coronavirus. Only around 60% of adults aged 18 and over have been fully vaccinated even as the new Delta variant of COVID-19 has contributed to a surge in cases. Full approval of Pfizer's shot would also make it easier for physicians to prescribe a third booster shot to people who could benefit from an additional dose. The FDA has authorized Pfizer's shot as a booster for people with weakened immune systems, but the White House plans to offer them much more widely in the coming months. read more The White House earlier this week said it plans to give out 100 million booster shots, many supplied by Pfizer, to at-risk Americans, including anyone whose initial inoculation is more than 8 months old, starting in September. Some experts, including at the World Health Organization say there is not yet enough data be certain boosters are needed.
