Idaho begins rationing health care as Covid surge crushes hospitals,7454,"BOISE, Idaho — Idaho public health leaders announced Tuesday that they activated “crisis standards of care” allowing health care rationing for the state’s northern hospitals because there are more coronavirus patients than the institutions can handle. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare quietly enacted the move Monday and publicly announced it in a statement Tuesday morning — warning residents that they may not get the care they would normally expect if they need to be hospitalized. The move came as the state’s confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocketed in recent weeks. Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. The state health agency cited “a severe shortage of staffing and available beds in the northern area of the state caused by a massive increase in patients with Covid-19 who require hospitalization.” The designation includes 10 hospitals and healthcare systems in the Idaho panhandle and in north-central Idaho. The agency said its goal is to extend care to as many patients as possible and to save as many lives as possible. The move allows hospitals to allot scarce resources like intensive care unit rooms to patients most likely to survive and make other dramatic changes to the way they treat patients. Other patients will still receive care, but they may be placed in hospital classrooms or conference rooms rather than traditional hospital rooms or go without some life-saving medical equipment. At Kootenai Health — the largest hospital in northern Idaho — some patients are waiting for long periods for beds to open up in the full intensive care unit, said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff. Inside the ICU, one critical care nurse might be supervising up to six patients with the help of two other non-critical care nurses. That’s a big departure from the usual one ICU nurse for one ICU patient ratio, he said. On Monday, the Coeur d’Alene hospital started moving some coronavirus patients into its nearby conference center. A large classroom in the center was converted into a Covid-19 ward, with temporary dividers separating the beds. Some emergency room patients are being treated in a converted portion of the emergency room lobby, and the hospital’s entire third floor has also been designated for coronavirus patients. Urgent and elective surgeries are on hold, Scoggins said, and Kootenai Health is struggling to accept any of the high-level trauma patients that would normally be transferred from the smaller hospitals in the region. Other states are preparing to take similar measures if needed. Hawaii Gov. David Ige quietly signed an order last week releasing hospitals and health care workers from liability if they have to ration health care. The unfolding crush of patients to Idaho hospitals has been anticipated with dread by the state’s heath care providers. Medical experts have said that Idaho could have as many as 30,000 new coronavirus cases a week by mid-September if the current rate of infections lasts. “Crisis standards of care is a last resort. It means we have exhausted our resources to the point that our healthcare systems are unable to provide the treatment and care we expect,” Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in a statement. He added: “This is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid. The best tools we have to turn this around is for more people to get vaccinated and to wear masks indoors and in outdoor crowded public places. Please choose to get vaccinated as soon as possible – it is your very best protection against being hospitalized from Covid-19.” The designation will remain in effect until there are enough resources — including staffing, hospital beds and equipment or a drop in the number of patients — to provide normal levels of treatment to all. More than 500 people were hospitalized statewide with COVID-19 on Sept. 1 and more than a third of them were in intensive care unit beds. Idaho’s hospitals have struggled to fill empty nursing, housekeeping and other health care positions, in part because some staffers have left because they are burned out by the strain of the pandemic and because others have been quarantined because they were exposed to Covid-19. Late last month, Little called in 220 medical workers available through federal programs and mobilized 150 Idaho National Guard soldiers to help hospitals cope with the surge. Two hundred of the federal workers are medical and administrative staffers available through a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. The U.S. Department of Defense agreed to send a 20-person medical response team to northern Idaho. The Idaho National Guard soldiers will help with logistical support such as screenings and lab work. On Tuesday, the governor called the move to limit care “an unprecedented and unwanted point in the history of our state” and urged residents to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that full vaccination with any of the currently available coronavirus vaccines dramatically reduces the risk of requiring hospitalization for a coronavirus infection. “More Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations, many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines,” said Little, who is a Republican. When the pandemic first came to Idaho at the start of 2020, Little ordered a partial shutdown of the state — ordering some businesses to temporarily close or shift to take-out style services, banning some large gatherings and asking residents to stay home as much as possible. The move was aimed at ensuring that hospitals wouldn’t become overwhelmed by patients. Idaho was on the verge of enacting crisis standards of care during a major coronavirus surge last winter, but narrowly avoided doing so — making this the first time the state has taken the drastic measure. Little reopened the state in stages over a period of several months and has not reimposed restrictions limiting gatherings. Businesses are mostly operating as normal. The state’s crisis guidelines are complex, and give hospitals a legal and ethical template to use while rationing care. Under the guidelines, patients are given priority scores based on a number of factors that impact their likelihood of surviving a health crisis. Those deemed in most in need of care and most likely to benefit from it are put on priority lists for scarce resources like ICU beds. Others in dire need but with lower chances of surviving will be given “comfort care” to help keep them pain-free whether they succumb to their illnesses or recover. Other patients with serious but not life-threatening medical problems will face delays in receiving care until resources are available. “I hope that your takeaway from this is that the vaccines work. They are the best tool by far that we have,” to keep people from getting seriously sick from the coronavirus, said Jeppesen, the state health department director. The demand on hospitals is likely to increase in coming weeks as case numbers continue to climb, Jeppesen said, so everyone should take steps to avoid needing any emergency care if possible by wearing seatbelts, taking medication as prescribed and reconsidering activities like riding bikes that can lead to accidents. “Just be a little more careful,” he said.","Sept. 8, 2021"
How two Americans fared with the German health care system,6193,"Americans are divided about how to pay for medical care and insurance, an issue that will continue to be debated hotly as presidential candidates tout their plans for overhauling the nation’s health care industry. Whether the “fix” is found in the Affordable Care Act, private insurance, ""Medicare for all"" or something totally different, some Americans are pointing to health care systems in other wealthy countries as models. One such country is Germany. Courtney Reich, 28, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2009. Even though she was on her family’s health insurance at the time, she said she had to pay hundreds of dollars every month for her insulin, which was necessary for her survival. But when the Chicago native moved to Germany, Reich said she was shocked to learn both her insulin and insulin pump were totally covered — no out-of-pocket expenses. “As a student at a public university in Germany, I automatically qualified for the public health care system,” Reich said. “I was really surprised that everything necessary to take care of my diabetes was covered, 100 percent.” Reich said she couldn’t help feeling like a drain on the country’s system, and expressed those feelings to her German friends. They reassured her they simply viewed health care differently. “It’s about having a safety net, because tomorrow you don’t know what could happen,” Reich told NBC News. Six years later — still living in Germany — Reich has embraced the idea of a safety net. “I don’t need to worry about crazy stuff coming up month to month. I’d rather be paying a steady fee and knowing I’m safe,” she said. Germany has what's called a universal multi-payer health care system. It encompasses both statutory health insurance for people who earn less than a certain salary, as well as private health insurance for those who earn more and choose to purchase their own. Employers and their employees pay for most of the health care system in Germany through premiums. All workers contribute about 7.5 percent of their salary into a public health insurance pool. Employers match that 7.5 percent contribution. This “all for one and one for all” approach to health care has roots in the Middle Ages, when German craftsmen paid into one fund that was used to help any of its members in case someone became ill or suffered financial hardship. The ideology lives on in the modern German system. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care. “We are one big community,” said Dr. Henning Baberg, a cardiologist and the medical director of Helios Hospital Berlin-Buch. “The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.” “But they all get the same treatment,” he added. Baberg likens the difference between statutory and private health insurance in Germany to the difference between economy and business class on a commercial airline flight. Same flight, same plane, same safety profile. And the system imposes strict limits on out-of-pocket costs, greatly reducing the number of surprise medical bills. The maximum copay for prescription medications is about $10 or $11. Helene and Michael Sula, both originally from Dallas, are also expatriates like Reich. Unlike Reich, however, they pay for private health insurance. The Sulas chose to live in Germany for its central European location, and were taking advantage of the country’s proximity to the Austrian Alps when Helene tore her anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, while skiing. “When I fell, I didn’t think it was that bad,” Helene Sula, 32, recalled. “It wasn’t until a man came up to me and said, ‘We’re going to need to turn your leg back the other way’ that I realized something bad had occurred.” The couple said Helene Sula was lucky to find a doctor who could do an MRI quickly once back in Germany; most places they called were booked for weeks — a common disadvantage for elective procedures. They credited their private health insurance not only with getting a swift diagnosis, but also insisting on having the best surgeon available to do the operation necessary to repair her injured knee. “There’s a price difference, of course, but it’s your knee, so we thought we’d spend a little extra cash to get the best doctor available,” Michael Sula said. The cost for everything related to Helene Sula’s knee surgery was about $2,000, compared with $14,000 for the same treatment in America. Despite some language barriers, the Sulas said the German health care system was easy to navigate. “It’s much easier to pay your bills and understand your coverage than in America, where you’re sort of left to figure it out on your own,” Michael Sula said. Health care industry experts in the United States say the German system is a good example of an employer-based model of medical insurance. “No one pays more than two percent of their family income for out-of-pocket health care costs” in Germany, said Robin Osborn, director of the International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program at The Commonwealth Fund. “And if you’re sick, if you’re chronically ill, it’s one percent. No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs,” she said. But Osborn does not recommend the U.S. copy Germany’s or any other country’s health care system and adopt it here. “It’s important to remember that we do have outstanding health care in the United States. We have pockets of excellence. We have integrated delivery systems that are the envy of the world,” she said. “It’s just that not everyone gets that outstanding health care. It doesn’t exist uniformly across the country,” she added. Baberg, who received medical training at the University of California, San Diego, said one advantage the U.S. health care system has is transparency. Although Germans can go to any hospital they want, it’s more difficult for them to find data on quality outcomes for individual facilities. But, he added, the U.S. health care system is flawed in a different way: Americans with less money get less health care. “That’s wrong,” Baberg said. “That’s not humanity. And humanity should be a big part of medicine.” FOLLOW NBC HEALTH ON TWITTER & FACEBOOK","July 1, 2019"
"Only 6 able to sign up on healthcare.gov's first day, documents show",3114,"Only six people were able to enroll for health insurance through the Obamacare website on the first day, according to documents released Thursday by Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The documents also show that by the end of the day Oct. 2, only 248 enrollments had been completed through healthcare.gov. According to notes from a meeting on the morning of Oct. 2, there was a laundry list of ""ongoing issues"" with healthcare.gov, including ""high capacity on the website, direct enrollment not working, VA system not connecting, Experian creating confusion with credit check information.""   An aide for the Oversight Committee said the notes were taken during ""War Room"" meetings at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance, part of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is implementing Obamacare. According to the aide, the meetings included administration officials and contractors discussing the standing issues and problems with the website’s launch. The documents only span two days: Oct. 2 and 3. The six enrollments that had been completed by the morning of Oct. 2 were spread across Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina, Blue Cross Blue Shield Kansas City, CareSource and Healthcare Service Corp., the documents say. Notes from an Oct. 2 ""PM"" meeting say that that ""direct enrollment is still not working,"" and ""consumer access issues are occurring; some estimates show 40,000 people in the waiting room."" At the time of that report approximately 100 enrollments had been completed. Notes from a meeting on the morning of Oct. 3 said that by then 248 enrollments had been completed. Administration officials have said that early enrollment numbers would be very low. ""These appear to be notes, they do not include official enrollment statistics,"" HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in an email in response to a request for comment. ""We will release enrollment statistics on a monthly basis after coordinating information from different sources, such as paper, on-line, and call centers, verifying with insurers, and collecting data from states. ""As the secretary said before Congress, we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time ... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period.""  She pointed to the experience of Massachusetts, which launched a statewide health insurance program. In the first month of open enrollment in 2007, only 123 people signed up for coverage, but by the second month that number was 2,289, and eventually more than 36,000 signed up in the first year. The launch of healthcare.gov has been riddled with problems of functionality and reliability that initially prevented many people from registering for accounts, much less signing up for insurance. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged the problems and an outside task force of tech gurus has been brought in to help fix the flaws. Frank Thorp is an NBC News Capitol Hill producer.

Why is health care so expensive in the United States?,6257,"These days, all it takes is one surprise medical bill to send a patient into bankruptcy. The United States' health care system operates differently from many others in the world with high costs for the individual as a main, distinguishing characteristic. In fact, the higher prices mean the U.S. spends more on health care than other ""developed countries,"" a 2019 Johns Hopkins report found. What's more, almost one in three Americans worries about affording health care, according to a February 2020 survey from NBC News. (In June, a man who was hospitalized with Covid-19 for 62 days received a $1.1 million medical bill.) So, what exactly makes health care in the U.S. so expensive? Health insurance prices? Government regulation — or lack thereof? The pharmaceutical industry? TMRW talked to experts on different aspects of the health care system who pointed to five overall reasons. The most salient reason is that U.S. health care is based on a ""for-profit insurance system,"" one of the only ones in the world, according to Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, who's advocated for reform in the health-insurance market. In the U.S., most health insurance is administered by private companies and individuals must pay for it themselves, even if their employer subsidizes some of it. In contrast, ""lots of other countries have some element of private something, but there is that baseline understanding that health care is a right, not a privilege,"" Balber said. The underlying motive to make money has a ripple effect that increases prices, she continued. For example, insurance companies spend an ""enormous amount of money on utilization review,"" the process that determines whether a medical service is covered under a given plan, adding that the goal is ""to not pay consumers for the care they thought they were insured for."" Similarly, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed to a lack of universal health care, where everyone is guaranteed access without undergoing financial hardship, as a primary reason for high costs. ""Part of our system is that everybody is ... paying for somebody else's underpayment, whether they like it or not,"" he said. ""Everybody is trying to figure out who else can pay for it instead of them."" Benjamin blamed the complex and fragmented structure of U.S. health care — from billing to care delivery — which can unnecessarily prolong administrative processes and increase overhead. A recent study found that in 2017, administrative costs made up 34.2% of health care costs in the U.S., twice the percentage in Canada, which has a decentralized, publicly funded system. Another example: Medicare, the country's national health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, has much lower administrative costs, between 1.1 and 7%. ""Medicare ... is drastically cheaper, because we don't spend a lot of time trying to deny people the care they need,"" Balber said. ""There's not as much dedicated to the bureaucracy of health care as there is in private systems."" U.S. health care exists in a system where patients are charged based on the services they receive, yet another reason why ""almost everything is more expensive here,"" Dr. Harlan Krumholz, cardiologist and professor of health policy at Yale School of Medicine, told TMRW. ""We have higher utilization of a lot of different services,"" he explained. ""In many parts of the health care ecosystem, people are paid for volume, and so that fuels an orientation toward, 'We might as well get an extra scan.' ... It's in the economic interest of the hospital, the physician, the health care system when they're being paid fee-for service, and the justification is that more is better."" As a result, there's lower use of primary care, Benjamin said, because the fee-for-service model ""encourages overutilization."" ""Instead of taking people in a room, examining them, taking the history and spending the time talking to patients, we ... do all the complicated stuff,"" he added. ""We're quick to jump to getting the CAT scan and diagnostic test when a history and physical exam would tell you the answer."" Balber argued that fee-for-service creates a ""perverse incentive"" to provide more procedures, instead of helping patients get healthier so that the nation as a whole needs fewer procedures. The U.S. also spends less than other countries on social support systems and long-term care, Benjamin added. This is perhaps the most challenging reason to disentangle, but the main idea is this: The companies that provide and charge for health care, like hospital systems and drug makers, have more power to keep costs high when they're negotiating with multiple potential payers, like various private insurance companies. But when they must negotiate with a single payer, like the federal government, there's more pressure to meet the demand in order to sell their services. For example, a recent study found that private insurance companies paid almost two and a half times what Medicare would've paid for the same medical service at the same facility. To make matters more costly, the U.S. government doesn't regulate what most companies in the health care space can charge for their services, whether it's insurance, drugs or care itself. While the U.S. health care system itself may be fragmented, in many parts of the country, there's only one or two companies providing health insurance or medical care. This means that, again, there's little to no incentive for them to lower costs since patients don't have much of a choice. ""We keep approving more and more mergers that raise costs significantly,"" Balber said. ""Then those hospitals buy up all of the private physicians ... and then profit motive is streamlined all the way down to your primary-care doctor."" What's more, health care providers are paid, on average, much more in the U.S. than in other countries, both Benjamin and Krumholz stressed. ""Despite the enormous cost that we have in America for health care, we don't get the same value of our health care dollar as other nations do,"" Benjamin added. ""If you get sick, this is the place to be, no doubt about that, but ... we don't have a system with everybody in and nobody out."" Related:","Sept. 22, 2020"
Biden administration invests $50 million in HealthCare.gov ad campaign,2811,"The Biden administration will invest $50 million in a new ad campaign to promote that its landmark Covid-19 relief law will make it less expensive to receive health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The American Rescue Plan, as the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law is called, created new subsidies that expand health care coverage. It also lowers costs by boosting subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the federal online exchange, HealthCare.gov, created by the Affordable Care Act. The new ad campaign aims to highlight the cheaper plans that people in the United States can now purchase on HealthCare.gov as of Thursday, April 1, because of the American Rescue Plan. It also aims to serve as a reminder that President Joe Biden extended the special health care enrollment period to Aug. 15. The campaign includes an ad for HealthCare.gov titled ""You CAN Do This,"" highlighting the affordability of plans on the federal government's marketplace. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement that the president is delivering on his promise to bring down health care costs. ""People deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing you can take care of your health without going into debt,"" Becerra said. ""The Department of Health and Human Services is doubling down on our efforts to ensure consumers, especially those hurting most, are aware that health care coverage is more affordable than ever on HealthCare.gov.” The $50 million will be spent across TV, digital, email, radio and streaming platforms. The administration intends to increase efforts to target uninsured populations, those who recently lost coverage, Spanish-speaking groups and other demographics that struggle with health care access. The Biden administration previously said the new subsidies, which are set to expire in two years, could serve as a significant inroad for the 14.9 million people who live without health insurance in the United States. Four out of 5 enrollees are expected to be able to purchase a plan for $10 or less per month, the administration has emphasized. Uninsured couples earning more than $70,000 could save $1,000 per month on their monthly premiums, a family of four making $90,000 will see premiums decrease by $200 per month and an individual making $19,000 or less will not have to pay a monthly premium. The new campaign begins Thursday, which is when people can begin taking advantage of the new subsidies. Administration officials had admitted that it was a technological challenge to automatically apply the savings to those already enrolled in Obamacare. Individuals will have to actively sign up or update their plans to receive the savings — though there is also an opportunity to recoup those dollars come tax season.","April 1, 2021"
Covid rescue package offers help for health insurance. Here's how to get the most benefit,6528,"There’s something for everyone with private health insurance in the American Rescue Plan Act, but determining the best way to benefit may be confusing. The $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law that President Joe Biden signed this month will make coverage significantly more affordable for millions of people who either who have marketplace coverage, are uninsured or have lost their employer coverage. In addition, it will eliminate repayment requirements for premium tax credits. Consumers can begin to see those improvements next month, but they may need to go to healthcare.gov and update their application for the changes to take effect then. The new provisions are temporary; none will extend past 2022 unless Congress acts to make them permanent. Many health care advocates hope that will happen. “If Congress can circle back and make these improvements permanent, it will go a long way toward making insurance affordable in this country,” said Stan Dorn, director of the National Center for Coverage Innovation at Families USA, a nonpartisan consumer health care advocacy organization. In the meantime, these provisions will help Americans get or keep their health insurance and provide economic stability as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. What’s new: When: 2021 and 2022 Who benefits: Just about everyone who has coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. Premium costs for people eligible for subsidies will shrink by $50 per month on average, according to the federal government, but some people will see much larger savings. Under the ACA, people with incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (from $12,760 to $51,040 for one person or $26,200 to $104,800 for a family of four) were eligible for premium tax credits to reduce their premiums for marketplace coverage. But under the changes passed in the new law, how much people owe is reduced at every income level and capped at 8.5 percent overall. For example, a single person who makes $30,000 annually will pay $85 per month in premiums on average under the new law for a silver-level plan instead of $195, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. A family of four making $75,000 will pay $340 rather than $588 per month for similar coverage, the analysis found. Everyone benefits from the changes, said Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the center, including people with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level ($51,040 for one person) who were previously not eligible for premium tax credits. An older customer not yet in Medicare “with an income just over 400 percent of the federal poverty level in some states would be paying 20 percent to 30 percent of their income toward their health care premium,” she said. “Now that will be capped at 8.5 percent.” At the other end of the income spectrum, people with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level ($19,140) will owe nothing in premiums. Under the ACA, they had been required to pay up to 4.14 percent of their income as their share of the premium cost. Steps to take now: When: 2021 Who benefits: Anyone who has received or has been approved to receive unemployment insurance benefits in 2021. Under the American Rescue Plan, anyone who has received unemployment benefits this year will be considered to have income at 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $17,000) for the purposes of calculating how much they owe in premium contributions for a marketplace plan. Since people with incomes up to 150% of the poverty level don’t owe anything in premiums under the new law, these unemployed workers can get a zero-premium plan. If they buy a silver-level plan, they can also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions that shrink their deductible and other out-of-pocket costs. Officials are urging people receiving unemployment insurance to enroll in a marketplace plan now to take advantage of the law’s enhanced premium tax credits. The federal government said it will provide more information this summer about how to receive the additional premium tax credits for people who collect unemployment insurance. Step to take now: When: 2020 Who benefits: People who earned more money last year than they estimated when they signed up for marketplace coverage. Under the ACA, people estimate their income for the upcoming year, and the marketplace estimates how much in premium tax credits can be advanced to them every month. At tax time, people reconcile their actual income with their projected income, and if they received too much in tax credits, they generally must pay it back to the government. The new Covid-19 relief bill eliminates that requirement for 2020. The provision could help people who received unforeseen income last year such as hazard pay or perhaps were laid off and hired back as a contractor at higher pay but without benefits, experts said. Unfortunately, because of the timing of the new law, income tax forms and tax filing software don’t reflect these changes, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “A lot of people are going to think they owe money but they’re not going to,” she said. Steps to take now: When: April through September 2021 Who benefits: People who lost their employer-sponsored coverage and want to stay on that plan. Generally, when people get laid off and lose their employer coverage they can opt to keep it for 18 months, but they have to pay the entire premium plus a 2 percent administrative fee. This is done under provisions of a law known as COBRA. Under the new law, the federal government will pay the entire COBRA premium through September of this year. For people undergoing treatment for a medical condition, it can be important to keep their coverage and existing providers. And switching plans midyear can leave people on the hook for a brand-new deductible. But the newly enacted enhanced premium tax credits and free marketplace coverage for people who collect unemployment insurance make marketplace coverage much more affordable than in the past, experts note. That could be important because, after September, the new COBRA subsidies will end and people will be responsible for the entire premium, unless the government puts in place a special enrollment period for that circumstance. Without another special enrollment period, they might not be able to get into a marketplace plan until January. Steps to take now: Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook","March 23, 2021"
Whole Foods CEO John Mackey: The 'best solution' is to not need health care and for Americans to change how they eat and live,4141,"Whole Foods CEO John Mackey says the key to keeping people healthy in the United States is for people to eat better and live healthier lives. “I mean, honestly, we talk about health care. The best solution is not to need health care,” Mackey told Freakonomics Radio host Stephen Dubner in an episode released on Nov. 4. “The best solution is to change the way people eat, the way they live, the lifestyle, and diet,” Mackey says. “There’s no reason why people shouldn’t be healthy and have a longer health span. A bunch of drugs is not going to solve the problem.” Americans are not taking as good care of their own bodies as they ought to be, Mackey says: “71% of Americans are overweight and 42.5% are obese. Clearly, we’re making bad choices in the way we eat,” he says. “It’s not a sustainable path. And so, I’m calling it out.” It’s not the first time Mackey has called for better lifestyles as a solution to expensive health care. In 2009, he penned a piece for the Wall Street Journal along the same ilk, “The Whole Foods Alternative to ObamaCare,” in which he advocated for less government control of health care in the United States. “This begins with the realization that every American adult is responsible for his or her own health,” Mackey wrote. “We should take that responsibility very seriously and use our freedom to make wise lifestyle choices that will protect our health.” The controversial op-ed caused some to boycott Whole Foods. While it is true that poor diet can lead to dangerous and expensive health conditions (according to a 2019 New York Times op-ed, ""(c)ardiovascular disease costs $351 billion annually in health care spending and lost productivity, while diabetes costs $327 billion annually""), and it’s critical to improve, it is not enough, says Nadereh Pourat, a professor and the director of the Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. “The idea that if people look after themselves and have a healthy lifestyle it will improve their health is...a fundamental concept...and many public health interventions are designed to educate individuals to do exactly that,” Pourat tells CNBC Make It. That said, “there are other factors that lead to disease and determine the need for health care, such as genetics, adverse life events, exposure to chemicals, etc.,” and there are things like the pandemic currently going on. “So the public health perspective is to also have a capable and effective health care system that can provide services to screen for disease or risk factors (e.g., cancer screening), provide preventive services (e.g., flu shots), and provide treatment when needed,” Pourat says. And while Mackey recommends behavioral changes as the optimal fix for ballooning health care costs, Whole Foods provides full-time employees access to health insurance. However, Whole Foods announced in 2020 that part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week would no longer be eligible to buy into the company’s health-care plan. (At the time, a Whole Foods spokesperson said the change would affect less than 2% of its employees and that Whole Foods would work with employees to find alternatives.) Mackey, 67, himself is a vegan who meditates daily and monitors his own behaviors to make healthful changes. “I see how long I slept. I see the quality of my sleep. I see what my pulse rate was for the whole night,” Mackey told Dubner. “Any time I drink any alcohol at all, my deep sleep almost completely disappears, I don’t sleep as long, my pulse rate goes up. So, my body is trying to metabolize this alcohol.

"Healthcare Way Behind on Data Security, Cyber Firm Says",4823,"Despite high-profile hack attacks, like the Anthem breach in which cybercriminals exposed 80 million medical records, the health-care industry continues to shortchange Americans when it comes to protecting their data. That's the key takeaway from a new cybersecurity report from Forrester. ""When it comes to preparedness, they're woefully behind and that, to me, is the most concerning thing,"" said Forrester analyst Stephanie Balaouras. ""They've done it begrudgingly and they've done it as something that they need to comply with at the lowest possible cost, as opposed to something they really embrace,"" she said. ""The focus, to date, has really been more on achieving HIPAA compliance rather than overall privacy,"" Balaouras said. (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, provides federal protections for personally identifiable information held by providers and their associates, and gives patients certain rights regarding that information.) Read More from CNBC: Anthem Hacked, Millions of Records Likely Stolen As much as innovations in health care and connected devices — from GPS-enabled asthma inhalers to wearable tech tattoos that monitor vitals signs — mean improvements in human health and longevity, they also mean more ways cybercriminals can steal private data. The data can be extremely valuable. Stolen credit cards sell for a just few dollars on the black market, but electronic health records can fetch as much as $50 each. ""When you think of a medical record, it encompasses a lot of the same personally identifiable information that a cybercriminal might gain from breaching a retailer,"" said Balaouras. ""But now, they also have more extensive medical information about you."" Forrester predicts that in 2016 hackers will release ransomware for a medical device or wearable. And unlike credit card theft, which can be quickly resolved, medical identity theft can have long-term effects on individuals personally. ""Now your medical record has been corrupted, somebody thinks you've got a certain diagnosis when you don't, or you've been on certain medication when you haven't, so It can have not just financial consequences, but also medical service consequences down the road,"" Balaouras said. Read More from CNBC: Citing Hacking Risk, FDA Says Hospira Pump Shouldn't Be Used ""Hackers are carefully picking their victim organization, learning its businesses, understanding its partner relationships, and testing for weaknesses and vulnerabilities. To make a lot of money stealing and monetizing personally identifiable information, a cybercriminal organization will want to steal as many records as possible,"" wrote Forrester in a report looking at the world's biggest consumer data breaches. Over the last 14 months, the five biggest breaches accounted for 77 percent of all breached records, and the Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield breach is second only to Home Depot in terms of the number of victims. Premera Blue Cross also made the top five — a September 2014 hack attack breached 11 million customer records. Yet insurance companies, hospitals and doctors allocate an average of just 14 percent of their IT budgets to security. By contrast other industries, many of which are far less attractive to cybercriminals, are investing upward of 20 percent. ""They haven't really thought about themselves as an actual cybersecurity target, I just think, from an overall budget perspective,"" Balaouras said. ""The fines are getting bigger every year,"" Balaouras said. New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University agreed to pay the Office for Civil Rights, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, $3.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for failing to protect thousands of medical records in 2014. ""There are also reports that the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), has a significant pipeline of unprecedented settlement agreements,"" wrote Forrester. Read More from CNBC: Three Indicted in U.S. Over Major Hacking Scheme In light of the rise in hack attacks and the Anthem breach, Forrester has this advice to the industry: 1) adopt two factor authentication for access to databases containing sensitive patient information; 2) use behavioral analytics to identify suspicious behavior and encrypt data; 3) realize that identity protection is no longer a good enough mea culpa. DHHS declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Anthem said there is no evidence that medical information such as claims, test results, or diagnostic codes, was targeted or obtained. Instead, the data accessed may have included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health care ID numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and employment information, including income data.","Nov. 13, 2015"
North Dakota allows Covid-positive healthcare workers to stay on job; nurses warn it's 'irresponsible',6867,"As hospitals in the state reach capacity and face dire staff shortages, North Dakota's governor announced this week that the state will allow healthcare workers who have tested positive for Covid-19 to continue working in coronavirus units. The order applies only to those who have asymptomatic cases, and the Covid-positive nurses will only be allowed to treat other Covid-19 patients. Still, some nurses worry that the practice might not be safe, and some health administrators in North Dakota are warning of burnout among hospital staff. ""I think it's irresponsible,” Sarah Lothspeich, an ER nurse in Fargo, told NBC News. ""We have to think about the patients that don't have Covid, the staff that don't have Covid. The amount of times I've thought about this whenever somebody leaves my facility with Covid: ‘How many doorknobs have they touched to leave? Who's cleaning them? Who’s sterilizing the room?’ We are, but things could be missed,"" Lothspeich said. ""That might sound a little crazy to think about doorknobs, but I just think about the risk of exposure, somebody that has Covid-19, to somebody that does not. I think that risk is just too great to know the benefit isn't good enough."" Hospital administrators have asked for the extraordinary action to be taken, Gov. Doug Burgum said at a Monday press conference, and interim State Health Officer Dirk Wilke amended an order to allow the new measure to take effect. The move comes as the state struggles to alleviate a healthcare system overwhelmed by the coronavirus, with record positive cases pushing hospitals to operate at 100% capacity. “Our hospitals are under enormous pressure now,” Burgum said. “In the last few days, our hospitalizations due to Covid [rose] by another 10 percent. That’s 60 percent higher than just four weeks ago.” Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Burgum has moved every county in the state to the “high-risk” category, asking residents to take the virus as seriously as they take “diabetes” or “heart disease.” Allowing healthcare workers to work while Covid-positive follows the Centers for Disease and Control’s “crisis capacity strategies,” which permits healthcare personnel suspected or confirmed to be positive to return to work if there are persistent staffing shortages. Burgum said this will not pose a significant risk for more spread, as only patients with the virus will be in contact with the COVID-positive healthcare workers. But Tessa Johnson, the president of the North Dakota Nurses Association, told NBC News she isn’t so sure. “What about the bathrooms and the break rooms and the elevators and all of those spaces? How are we going to keep those things clean? It’s not realistic,” she said. Johnson, who's also the executive director at a senior long-term care facility, said staffing has been a constant challenge during the pandemic. “People are exhausted. People are emotional. People are stressed,"" she said. ""People can’t take much more physically, emotionally. We’re losing nurses."" “Nurses are saying: ‘If we get positive at this point, we want to take the break. It’s a welcome break,"" Johnson said. ""We’re exhausted, we’re overworked, we need the rest. So, how can I get positive and come down with this disease and I still continue going at my best?’” Johnson said that due to the risk and toll the job takes, some nurses would rather be on unemployment — and the new measure permitting nurses to work while sick “is only going to make things worse.” When asked if she would personally raise her hand to continue working while sick with Covid-19, Lothspeich, the Fargo ER nurse, said “no”. Like many other nurses, she’s especially worried about the risk it poses to non-sick patients and staff. “They’re very worried about common spaces,” Johnson said of the nurses she’s spoken with. Sherri Miller, the North Dakota Nurses Association’s executive director, said it’s a “catch-22.” ""Having the Covid-positive, asymptomatic individuals working — there’s the risk of spread,"" Miller told NBC News. Some nurses, despite the risk, said they would continue working while Covid-positive and asymptomatic, and they welcome the new measure. “I wish I could have came to work with the proper stuff on that I could continue day to day caregiving,” said Lindsey, a long-term care nurse in Stark County who had Covid-19 and asked that her last name not be used. She told NBC News that while she was sick and isolating it was “very difficult” not being in the hospital where she works. Shelly Peterson, the president of the North Dakota Long Term Care Association, said nurses she’s been in contact with also wanted the measure to go into effect. “We were one of the organizations that asked the governor to consider this,” Peterson said. “We came forward with requesting because staff themselves were requesting it because they wanted to help. And eight months ago, I would have never thought we would be asking that.” Peterson said she even knows of one facility that’s already been doing this, prior to the governor’s announcement. “We're having outbreaks everywhere,” she said. ""There's just not enough staff.” Some nurses, including Sherri Miller and Tessa Johnson, say that a better solution would be for the state to initiate a mask mandate in order to reduce transmission. With fewer patients, they said, there’d be no need to have Covid-positive healthcare workers continue working. “If we continue to have these patients, I honestly don’t know what other solution there is than asking positive nurses to take care of them,” said Johnson, who believes that without a statewide mask mandate, North Dakotans may not take the virus seriously. When asked if she thinks that masks have been politicized in North Dakota, Johnson said, “We are a strong Republican state and a lot of the general public feel that way.” Dr. Doug Griffin, the chief medical officer at Sanford Health, said he thinks the state ""probably did deal with some Covid fatigue."" ""As a state, we let our guard down during the summer, large gatherings for Fourth of July over the holidays,"" he said, adding, ""We have variability on mask usage across the state, as you're probably well aware."" The governor's office did not immediately respond to an NBC News requests for comment. Griffin said that despite the governor’s announcement Monday, his hospital will not be allowing Covid-positive nurses to stay on the job. “We appreciate him taking this very seriously,"" Griffin said of the governor. “We are not to the point that we personally at Sanford Medical Center will be having nurses that are positive for Covid work and caring for patients.” His colleague Dr. Rishi Seth said the hospital will consider the measure if their situation worsens and that it's “a tool in the arsenal.” On Thursday, North Dakota broke the single-day case record with 2,019 coronavirus cases.","Nov. 12, 2020"
14 high-paying in-demand health-care jobs you can get without an MD or PhD,11656,"You don’t have to go to med school, earn a doctorate, complete a residency halfway across the country, and rack up thousands in student debt to land a top-paying job within the health care field. While physicians and surgeons continue to earn some of the highest salaries in the nation, and top the payroll for medical institutions, plenty of other positions require less education while paying salaries as high as $167,000 a year. CNBC Make It analyzed occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to discover which health-care jobs pay the most without requiring a doctorate. The resulting 14 roles range from helping care for newborn babies to treating communication disorders to designing artificial limbs, and some can be landed with an associate’s degree. The best part? Not only are all these jobs offering median wages of at least $69,000, they are all poised to dramatically grow over the next seven years, some by as much as 37 percent.

Nuclear medicine technologists typically need an associate’s degree from an accredited nuclear medicine technology program. Although, some technologists become qualified if they have a degree in a related health field and complete a 12-month certificate program. They commonly need a certification in the field and some states may require a license to practice. Median annual wage: $77,510 Projected job growth through 2026: 18 percent Sometimes called speech therapists, these workers diagnose and treat communication and swallowing disorders in children and adults. Most speech-language pathologists working today hold a master’s degree from an accredited program. All states regulate this role, and most, require a license. In states that do mandate licensure, pathologists need at least a master’s degree from an accredited program, supervised clinical experience, and to pass an exam. Median annual wage: $80,370 Projected job growth through 2026: 29 percent Genetic counselors assess individual or family risk for a variety of inherited conditions, such as genetic disorders and birth defects by studying patients’ genes through DNA testing. They provide information to other health-care providers as well as to patients concerned with developing or passing down inheritable medical conditions. Genetic counselors typically need a master’s degree in genetic counseling or genetics, as well as certification through the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Median annual wage: $82,330 Projected job growth through 2026: 13 percent Part of the health-care team called in to treat cancer, these therapists operate the machines that deliver concentrated radiation therapy to a patient’s tumor. They are also responsible for explaining treatment plans to patients, determining the region of the body receiving treatment, and checking for unusual reactions. Employers usually prefer to hire applicants with at least an associate’s degree in radiation therapy, though some companies accept those who’ve completed a certificate program. In most states, radiation therapists must be licensed or certified. Requirements vary depending on the state but typically include passing a national certification exam.

Trump promises vote on GOP health care plan — after the election,4737,"President Donald Trump said in a string of Monday night tweets that Republicans won't be voting on a new health care plan until after the 2020 elections. ""The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare,"" Trump tweeted. ""In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House."" Asked about the tweets on Tuesday, he told reporters at the White House, “I think we’re going to have a great health care package,"" without offering specifics about a GOP plan or when it would be unveiled. On the timing, Trump said he'd be ""showing you at the appropriate time."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters Tuesday that Trump's tweets came after he'd told the president that the Senate would not act on comprehensive health care reform while Democrats still held the House majority. ""I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate. He did say, as he later tweeted, he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign and suggested that that would be what he would be advocating in a second term if there were a republican Congress,"" McConnell said. ""So we don't have a misunderstanding on that."" The comments come as the Trump administration has abruptly shifted its focus back to health care over the past 10 days, beginning with Trump directing the Department of Justice to support a full dismantling of the Affordable Care Act on constitutional grounds. The Justice Department intervened in a federal case on behalf of a Texas judge who ruled the law is unconstitutional because of the new Republican tax law. Democratic leaders on Tuesday slammed the administration’s latest effort to to roll back President Barack Obama's signature health care law. ""President Trump confirmed he will hold Americans hostage through the 2020 election on health care,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference outside the Supreme Court. ""They have no health care plan,"" Schumer said. “It’s the same old song they've been singing. They’re for repeal, they have no replace.” “Don't let President Trump fool you,” he added. “They are not the party of health care. They are the party that wants to end health care.” “The potential consequences of this politically motivated move can’t be overstated,” Schumer said, pointing to what he said would be higher premiums, higher prescription drug prices and growing costs for women and seniors. “The cruel list goes on and on,” he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., followed Schumer, saying, “We’re here to condemn what the president did.” The Trump administration, she added, does “not believe in public policy that affects the good health of the American people.” The House is scheduled to vote Wednesdayon a resolution that would condemn the Trump administration's ""legal campaign to take away Americans' health care."" After Pelosi and Schumer spoke, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House that Trump ""wants to work with Congress” on health care, but that his priorities on a proposal to be voted on in the next Congress would include protecting preexisting conditions and lowering costs. Democrats, she said, “want a total government takeover of healthcare.” Trump's latest move on health care had appeared to catch Republicans off guard. Earlier Tuesday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters that the Department of Justice had ""erred in not defending the law"" and that she hoped the courts would uphold the Affordable Care Act. ""What would be the worst of all worlds would be to have a gap that would leave millions of Americans without insurance, that would cut the Medicaid expansion program, and hurt our rural hospitals and other medical providers. So a gap is the worst of all worlds,"" she said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for his part, has said the White House would be the big player in the latest health care battle, while Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said last week his committee did not have plans to move forward with health care legislation. After making the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act central to campaigning over the past decade, Republicans were unable to do such when they had control of the White House, Senate and House during the first two years of Trump's presidency. With health care polling as a top issue for voters in the 2018 midterms, Democrats were able to win control of the House by flipping 40 GOP-controlled seats.","April 2, 2019"
Medical groups urge mandatory vaccinations for all health care workers,2386,"Health care employers should mandate vaccinations for all their workers, a coalition of leading medical groups said Monday, as cases of Covid-19 continue to spike across the nation. While 60 percent of the adult U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, millions have still not received those lifesaving shots, leaving the nation vulnerable to the fast-spreading delta variant of the virus. ""As the health care community leads the way in requiring vaccines for our employees, we hope all other employers across the country will follow our lead and implement effective policies to encourage vaccination,"" according to a joint statement from 56 health care associations. ""The health and safety of U.S. workers, families, communities, and the nation depends on it."" The coalition includes the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Surgeons and the American Public Health Association. Requiring vaccinations for employment is the ""logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment"" to all patients in their care, according to the groups. ""Our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine,"" they wrote in the joint statement. Vaccine mandates continue to be a hot-button issue for Americans, some of whom have refused to get their shots due to hesitation over its speedy development or misinformation spread on social media. While the vaccines were developed with unprecedented speed and granted emergency use authorization, trials and ongoing monitoring have shown the inoculations have been very effective in safely preventing the disease or lessening its impact on patients. Earlier this summer, more than 150 employees at a Houston hospital system who refused to get the Covid vaccinations were fired or resigned after a judge dismissed an employee lawsuit over the vaccine requirement. And last week, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, in some of the sharpest language yet by a GOP office holder, tore into residents of her state who had refused to get vaccinated. ""But it's time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks,"" she said. ""It's the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.""","July 26, 2021"
"She called out health care misinfo on TikTok. Then, the trolls found her.",12283,"The video posted to TikTok showed a woman in a blue cardigan and brown medical scrubs dancing to a remix of Wale's ""Lotus Flower Bomb."" On screen, sandwiched between two sparkle emojis, the woman, who said she was a pharmacy technician, had written, ""Most common meds I've filled that cause cancer."" She then went on to claim medications like hormonal birth control, cholesterol medications and chemotherapy were cancer causing. So, Savannah Sparks, another TikTok user who goes by “Rx0rcist,” made her own video, part of what would become an ongoing series debunking medical misinformation on the app. “My name’s Savannah. I’m a doctor at a pharmacy, and I’m about to absolutely wreck your s---,” Sparks says in the video before launching into a fact-check of the pharmacy technician's claims. But Sparks didn't stop there. She then contacted the woman's supervisor. ""Her scope of practice doesn't allow her ... to counsel on medications so, especially coming from the realm of pharmacy, which is my wheelhouse, I really went in on that individual and I was like, 'You really should not be talking about this,'"" Sparks said. Sparks, 31, a Mississippi-based lactation consultant and doctor of pharmacy who is also a mother of a 2-year-old daughter, has become a prolific watchdog on TikTok for those she says are trying to spread misinformation — especially health care workers spreading bogus information about Covid-19. “In the past, I have been a little more reserved with how aggressive I have gone after these people, but the longer this pandemic went on, and the more and more misinformation we started seeing as health care workers on social media, the less I started caring about my tone and coming across a certain way,” Sparks said. This has earned her a massive following on TikTok. Her account has more than 467,000 followers and her videos rack in hundreds of thousands — and sometimes millions — of views. Sparks said she is not only looking for the removal of health care misinformation on the platform, but she also wants accountability. ""Anything that forces somebody to change their way of thinking ... it makes them angry,"" Sparks said. ""So, keeping that in mind, the fact that I'm doing this to so many people, I accept I'm doing exactly what I need to be doing, and I'm exactly where I need to be."" This approach to calling alleged offenders out has made her the target of online harassment. Her address has been posted on extremist websites, and her inboxes have been flooded with threats of rape and death against both her and her daughter, which, at one point, became so relentless it nearly drove her off the internet. Sparks’ most exhaustive callouts are part of a series on her TikTok that she calls “Petty Journal Club with Sav.” She said the videos began as a way to thwart general health care misinformation from spreading on the app, but soon morphed to be more specific as she said she realized some health care workers were not only propagating misinformation about the pandemic, but also teaching their followers how they could get around Covid restrictions. Using public information and social media, Sparks said she would identify the TikTokers making dubious claims or bragging about skirting rules and contact their employers or, in the most egregious cases, their respective field’s licensing board in an attempt to hold them accountable. And with TikTok’s algorithm frequently elevating Sparks’ videos to the “For You” page, the platform’s infinite scroll homepage, she continued to draw in even more viewers and followers. Sparks decides how to handle bad actors on a case-by-case basis, she said, contacting a person privately if she feels their intent is not malicious. If a person makes what she thinks is a major misstep — like a health care worker saying they don’t wear masks outside of work, spreading misinformation about medications or stealing vaccination cards — Sparks said she will share that person’s offending TikTok with her followers, explaining why the person is wrong. “It’s different for each case depending on how much information I can get on an individual and how egregious their error was online, because some aren’t as bad as others,” Sparks said. Sparks says one of her first ""Petty Journal Club with Sav"" videos was the pharmacy technician, who claimed certain medications cause cancer. When Sparks contacted the woman’s supervisor on Facebook, the supervisor was shocked, she said. “She was like, ‘Oh, my gosh. I’m ashamed. I can’t believe she’s posting that kind of information,’” Sparks recalled. Karen North, a professor of digital social media at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said one reason viewers are drawn to this type of content is because it's like a catharsis for their real-life frustration around rule breakers. “We all know people who have done things that step over the lines in terms of what we think is right during a pandemic, whether it’s not wearing a mask or being anti-vaxxers or jumping the line to get a vaccine … to the extent we’re frustrated by people we know in our own social circles who are breaking our rules. We can now go online and not only watch someone break a rule but watch someone attack someone for breaking a rule,” North said. After a public callout on her page, Sparks said, the subject will sometimes go private or delete their various social media accounts. Sparks says she is meticulous about her work and knows she has a responsibility to do her due diligence first because her callouts could have hundreds of thousands of eyes on them and serious ramifications for the poster. “Even if they volunteer all that information on their own, linking their social media and where they work, unless I can be pretty certain that what they’re saying is not a joke or what they’re saying does have some malicious intent, I’m not going to push hard because I know that when I go in, I go all in,” she said. She does, however, recall once getting a detail of a callout wrong. A nurse, whom she had called out, listed a hospital as an employer on her Facebook, which Sparks included in a video about the nurse. The only problem? The nurse no longer worked there and a horde of Sparks’ followers had contacted the facility demanding that person be fired. “People started calling that hospital and then I reached out to the hospital directly and said, ‘This is what has happened. I’m sorry,’"" Sparks said. Jessa Lingel, an associate professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania who studies digital culture, said callout culture has a long history on social media, and began as a way for people of color to create accountability around major social issues. “Cancel culture, callout culture, that really comes from practices on Black Twitter of bringing attention to an issue and saying, hey, this is a thing where we need to align. Whether it’s #MeToo in its early days, that originated on Black Twitter, or whether that’s tied to Black Lives Matter or police brutality. Callout culture originated on Black Twitter,” she said. Lingel added that callout culture has since evolved from a political tool into a way individuals can get back at one another on social media for real or perceived grievances. This often gives way to someone being labeled a “Karen.” But Sparks has embraced the Karen moniker when it comes to her TikTok content — and she’s not the only one. TikToker Aunt Karen, 31, who asked that NBC News not use her real name or location in order to protect her safety, is renowned on the app for calling out those who have been caught engaging in racist behaviors. “The internet has always been a tool, but now it’s an even bigger tool and it’s the main frame for holding people accountable,” Aunt Karen said. Behind the scenes, Sparks and Aunt Karen said the people who make content calling out bad behavior on the internet, many of whom are women, have built a network supporting one another, and sometimes work together. “What I think is great is even though we all call people out, there’s different things that these creators speak out on. Aunt Karen talks a lot about racism and, as [she’s] a woman of color, I can learn a lot from that … Not only do I get to make a friend but I learn a ton from these people,” Sparks said. While experts say Sparks and Aunt Karen’s callouts — which have collectively drawn millions of views — can provide a counternarrative to those seeking more information, they’re doubtful TikTok vigilantism will change people’s deep-seated views, adding that research into online shaming shows it doesn’t generally bring about significant change. “Health care workers during Covid have enjoyed a lot of public support generally speaking and so that doesn’t mean mistakes can’t be made and that we shouldn’t pay attention to those mistakes. But, in general, the research on online shaming is not optimistic on whether any of this is going to have much of an impact,” Lingel said. Research also shows that online shaming is inherently impossible to police and can devolve into abuse, including threats of physical or sexual violence. Moreover, online shaming tends to dehumanize those on the receiving end and can turn a person who has violated a social norm into a target undeserving of empathy in the eyes of an online mob. The subjects of callout culture are not the only ones who have had to pay a price for having the eyes of the internet locked on them. On March 28, Sparks posted a video announcing she was stepping away from TikTok because of an onslaught of harassment. She said her address and phone number were posted online, and that her direct messages on Instagram were flooded with death threats directed both at her and her young daughter. Her business pages were bombed with negative reviews. And links to her TikTok account were posted to extremist forum 4chan. “They posted aerial photos of my mom’s house on 4chan, which they paired next to a video of me and my sister dancing in her backyard to confirm that I was still at her house so they could plan to murder, rape, and kill me,” Sparks said. Sparks said she had always endured modest backlash for her content, but the harassment ratcheted up in March to the point it became unbearable. ""I was getting probably a hundred [direct messages] a day, just every few minutes in my message requests on Instagram, in comments,"" she said, recalling that she was sent messages ""saying things like, ‘Kill yourself,’ ‘I’m going to rape you,’ ‘I’m going to rape your daughter,’ Very graphic.” The wave of ceaseless harassment and threats began, she said, after she posted a video about safety precautions she takes when running and got worse when she began calling out the alleged forged vaccine cards that some health care workers were bragging about on TikTok. “They went to my Facebook business page, they found my family, they found all my friends and started messaging them. Same thing, just graphic kinds of death threats,” Sparks said. Then, she said, when her information ended up on 4chan, she said trolls began contacting businesses she affiliates with as a lactation consultant, claiming she was a racist and asking that they no longer do business with her. The attacks continued to escalate until someone posted her phone number and the aerial photo of her mother’s house. NBC News reviewed nearly 20 of the threats sent to Sparks, some of which were sent by accounts with names like “times_up_savannah,” created solely to harass her. Sparks eventually filed a complaint with her local sheriff’s office and then made the decision to make her callout videos private and step away from TikTok. But about two weeks later she returned to the app. She said she feels it’s her “duty to stand up and do the right thing,” emphasizing that she wants to use her platform to be an ally to marginalized voices and to others like Aunt Karen, who are also making callout content on TikTok. “If I’m not willing to do it, who else would step up to do it?” Sparks said. “... A lot of people say, ‘Well, it’s not a big deal, it’s just TikTok.’ But the things that I talk about are a huge deal. Public health is a huge deal, especially when 500,000 Americans have died from this virus.”","May 1, 2021"
Why is U.S. health care so expensive?,6374,"Millions of Americans are finding out this month that the price of their health insurance is going up next year - as it did this year, last year, and most of the years before that. And it's not just that the price is going up; it's that it goes up faster than wages and inflation, eating away at our ability to pay for other things we want (beer, televisions, vacations) or need (rent, heat, food). Does it have to be this way? Why does health care grow so much faster than almost any other spending category so consistently? And will it ever stop? ""At some point it's not going to be worth it to have less food, less travel in order to spend money on health care,"" said Louise Sheiner, a health economist at the Brookings Institution. ""That's what really stops it."" Insurance premiums, which reflect spending on medicines, doctor visits, tests and hospital stays, have climbed 213 percent since 1999 for family coverage purchased through an employer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care. Wages, by comparison, have risen 60 percent, while inflation is up 44 percent. Related: Obamacare Doesn't Cost More Than Other Insurance Here's why the price of health care doesn't grow like, say, the price of dishwashers or blue jeans - and why that's unlikely to change anytime soon. Insurers and employers have been trying for years to make patients better health care shoppers and force doctors and hospitals to compete on price. They've raised deductibles or out-of-pocket costs on coverage and given tools to patients so they can compare prices and quality. The idea is that patients become more motivated to price shop when they first have to pay several hundred dollars toward the bill due to a high deductible. Many see this push as a key to curbing health care spending, since insurance tends to hide the full cost of care from the patient. This can work ... for small stuff, said Renya Spak of the benefits consultant Mercer. Patients will shop if they need an MRI scan on their shoulder. But Spak isn't convinced it will do much for things like surgeries, when the insurer or employer will wind up covering much of the bill anyway and the best deal might involve travel away from family. ""It's not human nature to be rational thinkers about health care cost decisions,"" she added. ""It will never be just like buying a lawnmower."" Related: Trump's Plan Would Raise Health Costs Consumers also prioritize health care purchases over other buying decisions, especially if they have basics like food and shelter covered. You'll have back surgery to alleviate chronic pain before you take that long-awaited trip to Paris. ""What good is a better house if you are too sick to enjoy it?"" said Charles Roehrig, an economist and vice president of the nonprofit Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending. A carmaker can knock down the cost of making a vehicle by replacing auto workers with robots in parts of the assembly line. Treatment advances in health care are geared more toward making something more effective, not cheaper, noted Paul Fronstin, an economist with the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Related: U.S. Health Costs Are All Over the Map A device maker may come up with a new hip that improves a patient's quality of life, but it's likely more expensive and the surgery might require the same number of doctors and nurses or more. A drugmaker might produce a new treatment that dramatically improves a condition but it may come with a bill of more than $50,000 in the meantime. Device and drugmakers have been producing a steady stream of new products for consumers, and insurers that pay the bills have a limited ability to keep prices for those devices and drugs down. ""Every year, it's kind of like Christmas. They deliver all this new stuff and of course they deliver it at high prices and insurance covers it,"" said Mark Pauly, a health economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. People with coverage through their employers should expect premium hikes of 5 percent or 6 percent next year, depending on where the employee lives and what adjustments a company makes. That's double the forecast for inflation next year. And the rising rates may keep them from getting a raise, too. Employers often pay most of the bill for employee coverage, leaving them less money to increase salaries when rates rise. Customers shopping on the Affordable Care Act's public insurance exchanges will see premium hikes of 20 percent or more in many markets, though those increases aren't just because of rising health care spending. The Obamacare exchanges have seen wild price swings in part because insurers are still trying to balance out claims they pay in this relatively new coverage. Related: Five Easy Ways to Cut Your Health Costs All told, health care costs, including the insurance bill and money paid out of pocket, made up 7.8 percent of the average consumer's total expenses in 2015, up from 5.7 percent in 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, much bigger portions of personal budgets like housing, food and transportation all slipped. Health care spending now accounts for more than 17 percent of the U.S. economy. In 1980 it was just half that. Economists and benefits experts say this trend has to slow at some point, or consumers won't have enough money left to spend on things unrelated to health care. Some think big, disruptive changes in how we buy and use care may be needed. Related: Obamacare Premiums Are Going up. What Does That Mean? That might mean that more insurers could drastically restrict a patient's doctor choice in order to gain better negotiating leverage over the cost of care, a trend that is growing on the ACA's exchanges. Mercer's Spak thinks employers need to lead, since they cover so many people. She noted that some companies have started contracting directly with big hospital systems for health care, cutting out the insurance middleman. Sheiner, the Brookings Institution economist, says health spending may slow if drug and device makers stop developing new technology or drugs as quickly. But she thinks health care will keep climbing until people decide they aren't going to burn any more of their paycheck on it - and we're not there yet. ""You never say never, but I don't think we should expect that any time soon,"" she said.","Nov. 4, 2016"
Obama to meet with tech executives to discuss HealthCare.gov,1473,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will meet executives from leading technology companies like Google and Apple on Tuesday to discuss ways to improve the functioning of the health care website, HealthCare.gov, the White House said.
 A White House official said the meeting would cover capacity issues with HealthCare.gov, which has not worked well since its since its Oct. 1 rollout. Many people who have had their private insurance plans canceled face a Dec. 23 deadline to get signed up in order to have insurance on Jan. 1. It was unclear what Obama might learn from the technology company CEOs that have had little to do with health care, but appearing with some of the biggest tech executives in the country could help convince Americans that Obama can fix the health care website's problems. Obama's job approval rating has tumbled to around 40 percent in the face of a host of problems with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. The meeting will include executives such as Apple's CEO Tim Cook, Twitter's Dick Costolo, Google's Eric Schmidt and Faceook's Sheryl Sandberg, among others. Others include Netflix's Reed Hastings, Comcast's Brian Roberts, AT&T's Randall Stephenson and LinkedIn's Erika Rottenberg. The meeting will also include discussion of issues to do with the impact on technology companies of surveillance by the National Security Agency in the wake of the unauthorized intelligence disclosures made by former U.S. spy contractor Edward Snowden. ","Dec. 17, 2013"

More hospitals hit by ransomware as feds warn about cyberattacks,4975,"A recent wave of ransomware attacks has infected more hospitals than previously known, including a University of Vermont network with locations in New York and Vermont. The University of Vermont Health Network is analyzing what appears to be a ransomware attack from the same cybercrime gang that has infected at least three other hospitals in recent weeks, according to two sources familiar with the investigation who weren't authorized to comment about it before it is complete. Several federal agencies warned Wednesday of ""an increased and imminent cybercrime threat"" to the country's health care providers, particularly from a gang that uses a strand of ransomware called Ryuk. The U.S. has repeatedly hit record highs for daily confirmed coronavirus infections. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, sent an updated alert Thursday night with new technical information, adding that they have ""credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers."" As many as 20 medical facilities have been hit by the recent wave of ransomware, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The figure includes multiple facilities within the same hospital chain. Three other hospital chains have recently confirmed cyberattacks, believed to be ransomware, by the same gang: the Sky Lakes Medical Center, with 21 locations in Oregon; Dickinson County Healthcare System in Michigan and Wisconsin; and the St. Lawrence Health System in northern New York. It was not clear how much of their systems or how many locations had been hit by the ransomware. Tom Hottman, a spokesperson for Sky Lakes Medical Center, confirmed that the company had been infected with Ryuk and said its computers were inaccessible, halting radiation treatments for cancer patients. ""We're still able to meet the care needs for most patients using work-around procedures, i.e. paper rather than computerized records. It's slower but seems to work,"" he said in an email. Joe Rizzo, a spokesperson for Dickinson, said in an email that their hospitals and clinics are using paper copies for some services because computer systems are down. Rich Azzopardi, senior adviser to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said the state's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and other groups had been in communication about the St. Lawrence attack. Details about a major wave of ransomware attacks on U.S. hospitals began to emerge at the end of September when computer systems for Universal Health Services, one of the biggest hospital chains in the country, were hit, forcing some doctors and nurses to use pen and paper to file patient information. Jane Crawford, the chain's director of public relations, said in an email at the beginning of October that no one had died because of the attack. Ransomware attacks often gain access to secure systems and then encrypt files. The people behind the attacks then demand money to decrypt the files. Ryuk is transmitted through one of the cybercrime world's largest and most notorious botnets — an aligned army of compromised computers — referred to in cybersecurity circles as Trickbot. Both Microsoft and reportedly U.S. Cyber Command have independently undertaken efforts recently to disrupt Trickbot, apparently without enough success to prevent this wave of hospital infections. Brett Callow, an analyst for the cybersecurity company Emsisoft, said that the true extent of the attacks has yet to be uncovered and that local reports about hospitals indicated that several more had been hit. Ransomware attacks have been a consistent threat to American industry and local governments for several years, but attacks on the country's health care systems have risen this year, said Allan Liska, an analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, who monitors known infections. ""We've tracked 62 reported healthcare ransomware infections this year. Compared to 50 all of last year,"" Liska said in a text message. ""Keep in mind that unless an incident becomes public, there is a couple-of-month lag between the incident and reporting. So the real number is much higher,"" Liska said. A Department of Health and Human Services security memo produced for health care providers this year, which was reviewed by NBC News, shows that private security companies and the U.S. government attribute Ryuk ransomware to Russian cybercriminal groups. The private security firm CrowdStrike assessed with ""medium confidence"" that Russian threat actors use Ryuk, and the cybersecurity company FireEye said the ""most likely hypothesis"" is that Ryuk operators are Russian cybercriminals, according to the memo. As NBC News has previously reported, Russian cybercriminal groups sometimes work with the Russian government, but in other instances they can work on their own.","Oct. 29, 2020"
Do you know who owns your hospital?,17568,"In March, as the coronavirus gripped the nation, veteran emergency room doctor Ming Lin was growing concerned. Lin felt his facility, PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Washington, was unprepared for the pandemic, so he went to his superiors for help. Frustrated by their response, Lin took to social media, criticizing the hospital's operations in a series of posts. Days later, the hospital removed Lin from the rotation in the emergency department. He had worked at PeaceHealth for 17 years. Under typical medical industry practice, Lin's case would have been subject to peer review, experts said. But Lin's employer wasn't PeaceHealth. It was TeamHealth, a physician practice and staffing company that provides the hospital with emergency room services. TeamHealth is owned by Blackstone Group, a finance giant. When a private staffing firm teams up with a hospital, the right to due process can disappear. Lin's case was never heard. ""One of the objectives is to point out any deficiencies in the system that may harm the patient,"" Lin told NBC News. ""Because private equity has taken over health care, it has made that difficult."" Blackstone, which bought TeamHealth in 2016 for $6.1 billion, is what's known as a private equity firm, a type of financial entity that buys companies and hopes to sell them later at a profit. Over the past decade, private equity firms like Blackstone, Apollo Global Management, The Carlyle Group, KKR & Co. and Warburg Pincus have deployed more than $340 billion to buy health care-related operations around the world. In 2019, private equity's health care acquisitions reached $79 billion, a record, according to Bain & Co., a consulting firm. Private equity's purchases have included rural hospitals, physicians' practices, nursing homes and hospice centers, air ambulance companies and health care billing management and debt collection systems. Partly as a result of private equity purchases, many formerly doctor-owned practices no longer are. The American Medical Association recently reported that 2018 was the first year in which more physicians were employees — 47.4 percent — than owners of their practices — 45.9 percent. In 1988, 72.1 percent of medical practices were owned by physicians. In some parts of the health care industry, private equity firms dominate. For example, TeamHealth, owned by Blackstone, and Envision Healthcare, owned by KKR, provide staffing for about a third of the country's emergency rooms. This has been a seismic shift. During the 1900s, most hospitals were owned either by nonprofit entities with religious affiliations or by states and cities, with ties to medical schools. For-profit hospitals existed, but it wasn't until recently that they became nearly ubiquitous. For the past 20 years, private equity has been a source of immense wealth for the executives overseeing the entities. Most of those who head major private equity firms are reported to be billionaires, like the two men atop Blackstone: Stephen Schwarzman, a close adviser to President Donald Trump, and Hamilton ""Tony"" James, a major donor to Democrats. The impact private equity has had on employees and customers of the companies it has taken over, however, isn't always beneficial. To finance the purchases, private equity owners typically load the companies they buy with debt. Then they slash the companies' costs to increase earnings and appeal to potential buyers down the road. In the business of health care, the drive for profits can run counter to the goal of helping patients and protecting workers, critics say. Research shows, for example, that when private equity firms acquire nursing homes, the quality of care declines markedly. And when COVID-19 hit, hospitals associated with private equity firms were early to cut practitioners' pay and benefits because the operations could no longer generate profits on elective surgical procedures postponed during the pandemic. The heavy debt loads typically associated with private equity-owned businesses hinder their ability to withstand profit downturns. Finally, some medical professionals say, private equity's growing involvement in health care in recent years has contributed to shortages of ventilators, masks and other equipment needed to combat COVID-19, because keeping such goods on hand costs money. And to private equity, that's like putting dollar bills on a shelf. Private equity firms have jumped into health care with both feet. Apollo Global Management, a $330 billion investment firm overseen by Leon Black, owns RCCH Healthcare Partners, an operator of 88 rural hospital campuses in West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and 26 other states. Cerberus Capital Management, a $42 billion investment firm run by Steve Feinberg, owns Steward Health Care; it runs 35 hospitals and a swath of urgent care facilities in 11 states. Warburg Pincus, overseen by former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, owns Modernizing Medicine, an information technology company that helps health care providers ramp up profits through medical billing and, to a lesser degree, debt collections. The Carlyle Group owns MedRisk, a leading provider of physical therapy cost-containment systems for U.S. workers' compensation payers, such as insurers and large employers. Private equity's laser focus on cost cutting and operational efficiencies can benefit consumers, economists say, if lower costs are passed on to end users. Problems arise, however, when the push for profits reduces quality. That can be especially harmful in health care, in which patients' lives are on the line and it is difficult for consumers to comparison shop by analyzing quality of care. Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Mark Reiter is residency program director of emergency medicine for the University of Tennessee and past president of American Academy of Emergency Medicine, an advocacy group for practitioners. ""Private equity-backed health care has been a disaster for patients and for doctors,"" he told NBC News. ""Many decisions are made for what is going to maximize profits for the private equity company, rather than what is best for the patient, what is best for the community."" Representatives of every firm identified in this article declined to respond to broad criticisms of private equity in the health care arena. As for PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center, spokeswoman Bev Mayhew said it removed Ming Lin from the emergency department rotation because ""his actions were disruptive, compromised collaboration in the midst of a crisis and contributed to the creation of fear and anxiety among staff and the community."" She said his case wasn't subject to peer review because he still has privileges at the hospital. A TeamHealth spokesman said it continues to employ Lin and had offered to place him ""in another contracted hospital anywhere in the country."" Private equity firms have targeted health care investments for an array of reasons, most having to do with their potential profits. First, health care drives a huge part of the nation's economic output — almost 20 percent of gross domestic product. In addition, health care is a fragmented business with many small operators like physicians; private investors often find outsize gains in industries in which they can create economies of scale through consolidation. Ever on the hunt for efficiencies, private equity has brought changes to traditional health care practices, experts say. One example: the use of so-called physician extenders, like nurse practitioners, to see patients instead of actual doctors. Because such extenders have less training under their belts, their costs are well below those associated with physicians. In general, employing three extenders equals the cost of one physician, said Robert McNamara, professor and chairman of emergency medicine at Temple University and chief medical officer of Temple Faculty Physicians. Private equity-owned firms also use practitioners with less experience or training to save money, say doctors associated with the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine. In February, a patient arrived at the Calais Regional Hospital emergency department in Calais, Maine, near the Canadian border. He required intubation — the insertion of a breathing tube down his throat — but the doctor was unable to perform the procedure and had to call in local paramedics for help. The patient recovered. The doctor worked for Envision Physician Services, the KKR-owned company that had taken over staffing of the emergency department two weeks before the incident. DeeDee Travis, the hospital's spokeswoman, said that the doctor is no longer in rotation at the hospital but that his move had nothing to do with the incident. She said rural medicine requires the use of all resources, including local paramedic staff. Assessing the impact of private equity on the overall quality of care has been difficult, in part because ownership by the firms is relatively new. But in February, four academics at the University of Pennsylvania, New York University and the University of Chicago published an in-depth study analyzing care at private equity-owned nursing homes. The findings were stark. ""In the nursing home setting,"" the study said, ""it appears that high-powered profit maximizing incentives can lead firms to renege on implicit contracts to provide high quality care, creating value for the firms at the expense of patients."" Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Looking at data from 2000 to 2017 from over 18,000 nursing homes, the academics found ""robust evidence of declines in patient health and compliance with care standards"" after private equity concerns bought facilities. And when private equity firms' purchases of nursing homes were compared with those bought by other for-profit entities, such as nursing home chains, the private equity-owned properties resulted in greater quality declines, the study concluded. On April 2, well into the COVID-19 crisis, Steward Health Care, owned by Cerberus Capital, created a firestorm. It suspended intensive care unit admissions at Nashoba Valley Medical Center, a hospital in rural northeastern Massachusetts, and redeployed equipment and staff elsewhere to meet COVID-19 demand, according to a memo from the president of the facility. Hospitals aren't supposed to close such units without first notifying state authorities and holding community hearings. Audra Sprague, a longtime registered nurse at the facility, said the move ""completely took out an entire level of service. Anybody that needed ICU care, we didn't have one, we couldn't keep you."" Darren Grubb, a spokesman for Steward, said that the suspension has ""not impacted patient care"" at the facility and that state officials had ""validated that the ICU at Nashoba Valley remains adequately staffed and equipped to care for clinically appropriate patients."" Sprague said she is proud to serve patients in the same hospital where her grandmother was a nurse. She said that the facility had previously been owned by a private company but that patient safety and staff treatment had worsened since Steward took over. So she joined the nurses' union. ""Even when you say something is unsafe, there's little change that comes out of it,"" she said. ""They're not going to do a single thing that doesn't benefit them first and foremost."" Grubb called Sprague's view a ""baseless, selective, hyper-generalized claim."" For more than a century, company ownership of doctors' practices was barred under the Corporate Practice of Medicine doctrine, which was enshrined in most state laws. The doctrine and the laws hold that only individual physicians should be licensed to practice medicine, not corporations. But in the years leading up to COVID-19, the laws were rarely enforced. ""The states realized a long time ago that this is a real problem — fiduciary duty to shareholders rather than patients,"" Reiter said. ""These corporations are not taking an oath to do what's best for their patients, and they thought it would be better if doctors owned their own practices."" In response to the laws, private equity firms have structured their health care investments with physicians as owners, but in name only, McNamara said. Staffing companies like TeamHealth, for example, use what he called sham professional associations with doctors to get around prohibitions against the corporate practice of medicine. McHenry Lee, TeamHealth's spokesman, said the company's ""organizational structure is fully compliant with long established laws and precedents."" Referring to the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, Lee said the company has prevailed while facing judicial scrutiny ""initiated or funded by AAEM, where Dr. McNamara has made identical charges."" In a typical emergency room, McNamara said, the usual physician group charges three to four times the Medicare rate. TeamHealth is charging six times, he said. Last fall, United Healthcare, the giant insurer, canceled coverage at 500 hospitals with TeamHealth-run emergency rooms, largely because of high costs, a company spokeswoman said. ""A small number of providers are driving up the cost of care for the people and customers we serve,"" she said. ""This is particularly evident with private equity-backed physician staffing companies like TeamHealth."" United Healthcare provided NBC News with examples of TeamHealth costs far exceeding median charges for specific emergency department procedures. A patient visiting an emergency department with chest pains, for example, would face a median charge of $340, United Healthcare said, versus a TeamHealth bill for $976. Stitches on a minor cut would be $200 at the median rate, compared with $888 from TeamHealth. And the median rate for a broken arm is $665, while TeamHealth's charge is $2,947. Lee of TeamHealth declined to comment on the figures. Envision Healthcare is a physician staffing, emergency medicine and billing services company bought for almost $10 billion by KKR in 2018. Envision's website says it provides emergency medicine at 650 facilities in 40 states. Before the acquisition, Envision acknowledged in a 2014 securities filing that its contracts with physician groups might run afoul of laws barring the corporate practice of medicine, as well as fee-sharing arrangements between doctors and companies. It could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, and its contracts with affiliated physician groups ""could be found legally invalid and unenforceable,"" Envision said in the filing. A flurry of such cases didn't arise. But today, Envision's business has collapsed, again a result of postponed elective operations. Carrying $7.5 billion in debt, the company recently hired restructuring advisers and may file for bankruptcy. Aliese Polk, a spokeswoman for Envision, said the company is experiencing the same financial problems that many other health care providers are and is ""focused on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying significant resources to front-line clinicians caring for sick patients."" She declined to discuss its previous warnings about possible legal violations in its business model. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, private equity-owned health care operations had come under criticism from members of Congress and outsiders. TeamHealth, for example, was featured last year in a report by MLK50 and ProPublica for aggressively suing poor patients who had been unable to pay their emergency room bills. After the report, TeamHealth said it would stop the practice. The TeamHealth spokesman didn't respond to a question from NBC News about why it sued patients. Surprise emergency care medical bills have also emerged as a problem at private equity-run Envision. Patients can be ambushed by such bills when they visit an emergency department in a hospital that is in their insurance network but whose doctors work outside the network, charging separately for their services. Polk of Envision declined to comment on the company's role in surprise billing. Congress tried to address the problematic practice with legislation last year. But as the bill gained traction, Envision and TeamHealth quietly backed a purported grass roots organization called Doctor Patient Unity to advocate against the legislation, according to The New York Times. Doctor Patient Unity funded a $28 million media blitz against the bill, the report said, which didn't pass. Doctor Patient Unity didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Representatives from TeamHealth and Envision accused insurance companies of causing problems for patients seeking emergency care and said they didn't support the legislation because it would have benefited insurers at the expense of patients. Emily Maddoff and Chet Waldman, lawyers at Wolf Popper LLP, are fighting surprise medical bills in six class-action lawsuits in state and federal courts across the country. A unit of Envision is a defendant in three of the cases. A class-action case involving a patient in California has a final settlement hearing scheduled for June. If approved, the deal would provide 100 percent relief to the plaintiffs. ""We should not be running our health care system as a profit-making operation on steroids,"" said Eileen Appelbaum, an authority on private equity and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. ""Health care is not so much anymore about taking care of patients. It's way more about making money.""","May 13, 2020"
GOP health care plan could mean millions lose their work-based coverage,4845,"The Republican healthcare plan could signal the beginning of the end for employer-based healthcare insurance, a perk that millions of Americans take for granted. Roughly half of Americans were covered by employer-sponsored health plans in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But that could change, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s report on the GOP’s American Health Care Plan. Lawmakers and regular Americans digesting the findings of the report have focused on the big numbers: 24 million fewer insured and $337 billion in savings over the next decade. But a potentially more troubling sign comes from a comparatively smaller number: 7 million, the number of people the CBO estimates will drop off the roles of employer-sponsored health insurance over the next decade. Even defenders of the agency’s assessment of health care reform acknowledge that it had a big miss estimating the number of participants in the Affordable Care Act. One reason for the miss is that employers didn’t drop health care benefits to the extent the CBO estimated. Things could be different this time around. “Part of that net reduction in employment-based coverage would occur because fewer employees would take up the offer of such coverage in the absence of the individual mandate penalties,” the CBO report says. “[O]ver time, fewer employers would offer health insurance to their workers.” Related: The GOP Healthcare Effort Is Unraveling “There’s a decent amount of uncertainty. I think there are some reasons to suspect that if it didn’t happen before, it would happen now, because of where the tax credits are in the income distribution,” said Matthew Fiedler, fellow in economic studies at the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution. With tax credits for workers earning up to $215,000, the Republicans’ health care plan would push the incentives for companies not to offer benefits further up the income spectrum, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “It could particularly impact high-wage employers because they can send their employees into the nongroup market. There could be a push to do that because the income range on the subsidies is much wider.” If a wider pool of employees opts to take the tax credit and enter the individual market, companies would have a tougher time negotiating with insurers for coverage that is both affordable and comprehensive, with less-attractive offerings leading even more workers to forgo the benefit. Some experts argue that businesses today have a number of incentives not to rock the boat, especially in a labor market nearing full employment. “Part of having a good job… is having good benefits. It’s an expectation these days,” said James Gelfand, senior vice president for health policy with the ERISA Industry Committee, a group that represents large employers. “From SHRM’s perspective, employers continue to believe that offering health benefits is an important benefit to recruit and retain valuable talent,” said Chatrane Birbal, senior adviser of government relations at the Society for Human Resource Management. And for the near future, companies might be reluctant to plunge into an overhaul of their health benefits because many recently did so in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Related: Trump's Budget Could Have Devastating Effect on Scientific Community “On principle, that could happen, but especially as the economy is rebuilding itself, we need to remember that the existence of employer-sponsored insurance has always been on a voluntary basis,” said Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at health care and education organization Project Hope. “Having said that, there’s been a slow, secular decline.” The next economic downturn that gives corporations the upper hand in job negotiations could accelerate this decline, especially for certain types of businesses and geographic areas. “In general, it’s going to be firms with higher income workers and younger workers, and it will tend to be firms in lower cost areas because the tax credits are the same dollar amount,” Fiedler said. “Insofar as dropping does happen, I would expect it to be concentrated in smaller firms [because] they’re more likely to have all their employees in a single geographic area.” Related: Critics Warn Phase Two Won't Save Healthcare Plan “I think that for big companies… they’re not going to drop their people. You’re talking about your smaller businesses or your higher turnover employees,” said Ipsita Smolinski, founder and managing director of Capitol Street, pointing out that companies both big and small already are looking for ways to make workers pay more of their health care costs via high-deductible plans. “I think all bets are off in a downturn,” she said. “Employers are going to do what suits their bottom line.”","March 17, 2017"

"Healthcare.gov will work smoothly by end of November, government pledges",4758,"The troubled federal health insurance website will be fixed by the end of November, giving uninsured Americans two weeks to get signed up in time to have health insurance by the earliest possible date, officials pledged Friday. One of the main government contractors, QSSI, has been assigned to oversee the fix, says Jeff Zients, the newly appointed chief White House economic adviser who’s been tasked to fix the logjammed website. “We are confident that by the end of the November, healthcare.gov will be smooth for the vast majority of users,” Zients told reporters on a conference call. “Over the last week we worked with a team of experts to conduct an assessment of the overall state of the healthcare.gov site,"" Zients said. They lent ""fresh eyes"" to the problems plaguing the site. “The system is getting better,” he added. “There is a lot of work to do but healthcare.gov is fixable.” The website, which was promoted as a kind of Travelocity.com for buying health insurance, has been an embarrassment to the Obama administration since it opened Oct. 1. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says she did not know it would be such a disaster. “I didn't realize it wouldn't be operating optimally before the launch,” she told reporters while on a tour of East Austin Health Center in Austin, Texas, where she watched counselors help people struggling to use the website. “We knew if we had another six months, we’d probably test further,” Sebelius added. On Thursday, several contractors, including QSSI, told a House committee that the site wasn’t tested “end to end” until just two weeks before launch. They said they’d have preferred to have had months to test it. Republicans and Democrats alike have been strongly critical of the site, and Republicans have said they believe the problems reflect weaknesses in the entire health care overhaul called for by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The administration denies this and says the website, one of the main pillars of the reforms called for under the law, is getting better every day. Eventually the administration hopes 7 million people who currently do not have any health insurance will use the site to buy it. Most people will likely qualify for heavy government subsidies to do so. The law requires just about everyone to have health insurance of some sort by next year. Most people are covered by insurance provided by an employer; most people over 65 have Medicare. But about 15 percent of Americans have no health insurance at all. Some states are expanding Medicaid, the health insurance plan for people with low incomes, to more adults but many are not. Zients says 90 percent of people who come to the website now can create an account. But only about three in 10 can get all the way through the application process, he said. He says he has a ""punch list"" of items to fix, including software bugs that have prevented the system from operating smoothly. Zients said QSSI, which made the “data hub” that transmits information from one part of the site to another, would act as a general contractor to oversee the repairs. “It makes sense for a number of reasons,” he said. “They have done a good job already with the federal data hub. They have the skills and expertise to address these problems right now.” The federal government says about 700,000 people have been able to at least start the sign-up process in the 36 states served by the federal website, as well as in the 14 other states and Washington, D.C., which are operating their own sites. Separately, the Advisory Board Company said 350,896 people had applied on the 15 non-federal exchanges, and 115,060 had managed to actually pick an insurance plan and enroll.  That includes 37,000 in New York, 35,000 in Washington state and 26,000 in Kentucky. The Obama administration stressed that people still have plenty of time to sign up. “People will be able to apply by December 15 in order to get coverage by January 1st,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the site. Bataille also said to expect guidance “soon” from the White House on the last possible day that people can sign up for health insurance next year to avoid the risk of a penalty for not having it. The law allows the Internal Revenue Service to tax people $95 or 1 percent of income if they go three months or more without health insurance next year. Administration officials say they have always meant for people to have until March 31, the end of open enrollment, to sign up. But it’s possible that because of the way the law is written, people will need to sign up by Feb. 15 in order to have their policies in effect by March 31. Bataille says the White House is sorting this out.","Oct. 25, 2013"
Racial bias found in widely used health care algorithm,6246,"A widely used health care algorithm that helps determine which patients need additional attention was found to have a significant racial bias, favoring white patients over blacks ones who were sicker and had more chronic health conditions, according to research published last week in the journalScience. The bias was detected in the health services company Optum’s algorithm, but researchers say it is only one data-driven service of many that perpetuates disparities in medical treatment. An estimated 200 million people are affected each year by similar tools that are used in hospital networks, government agencies and health care systems nationwide, the study noted. “The risk is that biased algorithms end up perpetuating all the biases that we currently have in our health care systems,” said Ziad Obermeyer, an acting associate professor at the Berkeley School of Public Health who was the lead researcher on the study. “It furthers the vicious cycles that we all want to break.” The algorithm used heath costs to predict and rank which patients would benefit the most from additional care designed to help them stay on medications or out of the hospital. The study looked at more than 6,000 self-identified blacks and nearly 44,000 self-identified whites. Patients above the 97th percentile were marked as high-risk and automatically enrolled in the health program, yet the black patients had 26.3 percent more chronic health conditions than equally ranked white patients. “We already know that the health care system disproportionately mismanages and mistreats black patients and other people of color,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “If you build those biases into the algorithms and don’t deal with it, you’re going to make those biases more pervasive and more systematic and people won’t even know where they are coming from.” Optum’s algorithm harbored this undetected bias despite its intentional exclusion of race. This is because inequity is baked into algorithms when they’re built on biased data, Jha said. Cost is not a “race-blind” metric, and using it as a screening tool for high-risk patients led to the disparity the researchers found in Optum’s algorithm because, for one reason, Obermeyer said, black patients access health care less than white, wealthier patients do. Black patients spent $1,800 less in medical costs per year than white patients with the same chronic conditions, leading the algorithm to conclude incorrectly that the black patients must be healthier since they spend less on health care. Optum, based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, said in a statement that it appreciated “the researchers’ work, including their validation that the cost model within Impact Pro was highly predictive of cost, which is what it was designed to do.” But Obermeyer said that “simply because you left the race variable out of the model does not guarantee by any means that your algorithm will not be racist.” “When we’re making these algorithms, we make these choices that seem technical and small, they’re deeply important impacts — both positive and negative — on people’s lives,” he said. The causes of this cost disparity are convoluted and various, Obermeyer said. But at their roots is the disproportionate levels of poverty that black families and individuals face, he said. From lack of access to transportation to competing demands at jobs, poverty produces a variety of conditions that make black people less likely to access health care, Obermeyer said. “You would hope that people would recognize that there are a lot of factors that would keep different populations from either utilizing care or being able to access care, and built that in the system,” said Caitlin Donovan, spokesperson for the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Once black patients do access care, their treatment can be affected by overt or subconscious discrimination, Obermeyer said. Some physicians have negative perceptions of black patients in terms of intelligence, pain tolerance and behavioral tendencies, according to research. Black patients are prescribed less pain medication than white patients with the same complaints and receive fewer referrals for cardiovascular procedures. Black women are also three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. “The system leads to differential outcomes, and we’re all responsible for that,” Jha said. “People need to understand this for what it is, which is systemic bias we need to root out.” But Obermeyer is optimistic about the future of data-driven health care. Research like his can help root out and eliminate bias from medical algorithms, which Optum has already endeavored to do. The health services company replicated the study on a data set of 3.7 million people in coordination with Obermeyer. A new algorithm, which uses health prediction in conjunction with cost, saw an 84 percent reduction in bias. If fixed, the amount of black patients served by the algorithm would increase from 17.5 percent to 46.5 percent. “The tool applies complementary analytics from over 600 clinical measures to identify gaps in care based on well-established, evidence-based clinical guidelines,” Optum said. “These gaps, often caused by social determinants of care and other socio-economic factors, can then be addressed by the health systems and doctors to ensure people, especially in underserved populations, get effective, individualized care.” While human bias can be challenging to quantify and diminish, the bias in algorithms is far easier to eradicate, Jha noted. He believes that with the right application, algorithms could even lessen the impact of discrimination that has long plagued the medical field. “Algorithms that are built well with these issues taken into account can help doctors overcome subtle unconscious biases they might have,” Jha said. “Data and algorithms have a lot of potential to do good, but what this study reminds us of is that if you don’t do it right, you have a lot of potential to do harm.” “Once you understand the bias in the algorithm, not only do you understand the bias in the humans that shaped the algorithms, but you also have a roadmap to fixing it,” Obermeyer said.","Nov. 7, 2019"
More hospitals hit by ransomware as feds warn about cyberattacks,4975,"A recent wave of ransomware attacks has infected more hospitals than previously known, including a University of Vermont network with locations in New York and Vermont. The University of Vermont Health Network is analyzing what appears to be a ransomware attack from the same cybercrime gang that has infected at least three other hospitals in recent weeks, according to two sources familiar with the investigation who weren't authorized to comment about it before it is complete. Several federal agencies warned Wednesday of ""an increased and imminent cybercrime threat"" to the country's health care providers, particularly from a gang that uses a strand of ransomware called Ryuk. The U.S. has repeatedly hit record highs for daily confirmed coronavirus infections. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, sent an updated alert Thursday night with new technical information, adding that they have ""credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers."" As many as 20 medical facilities have been hit by the recent wave of ransomware, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The figure includes multiple facilities within the same hospital chain. Three other hospital chains have recently confirmed cyberattacks, believed to be ransomware, by the same gang: the Sky Lakes Medical Center, with 21 locations in Oregon; Dickinson County Healthcare System in Michigan and Wisconsin; and the St. Lawrence Health System in northern New York. It was not clear how much of their systems or how many locations had been hit by the ransomware. Tom Hottman, a spokesperson for Sky Lakes Medical Center, confirmed that the company had been infected with Ryuk and said its computers were inaccessible, halting radiation treatments for cancer patients. ""We're still able to meet the care needs for most patients using work-around procedures, i.e. paper rather than computerized records. It's slower but seems to work,"" he said in an email. Joe Rizzo, a spokesperson for Dickinson, said in an email that their hospitals and clinics are using paper copies for some services because computer systems are down. Rich Azzopardi, senior adviser to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said the state's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and other groups had been in communication about the St. Lawrence attack. Details about a major wave of ransomware attacks on U.S. hospitals began to emerge at the end of September when computer systems for Universal Health Services, one of the biggest hospital chains in the country, were hit, forcing some doctors and nurses to use pen and paper to file patient information. Jane Crawford, the chain's director of public relations, said in an email at the beginning of October that no one had died because of the attack. Ransomware attacks often gain access to secure systems and then encrypt files. The people behind the attacks then demand money to decrypt the files. Ryuk is transmitted through one of the cybercrime world's largest and most notorious botnets — an aligned army of compromised computers — referred to in cybersecurity circles as Trickbot. Both Microsoft and reportedly U.S. Cyber Command have independently undertaken efforts recently to disrupt Trickbot, apparently without enough success to prevent this wave of hospital infections. Brett Callow, an analyst for the cybersecurity company Emsisoft, said that the true extent of the attacks has yet to be uncovered and that local reports about hospitals indicated that several more had been hit. Ransomware attacks have been a consistent threat to American industry and local governments for several years, but attacks on the country's health care systems have risen this year, said Allan Liska, an analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, who monitors known infections. ""We've tracked 62 reported healthcare ransomware infections this year. Compared to 50 all of last year,"" Liska said in a text message. ""Keep in mind that unless an incident becomes public, there is a couple-of-month lag between the incident and reporting. So the real number is much higher,"" Liska said. A Department of Health and Human Services security memo produced for health care providers this year, which was reviewed by NBC News, shows that private security companies and the U.S. government attribute Ryuk ransomware to Russian cybercriminal groups. The private security firm CrowdStrike assessed with ""medium confidence"" that Russian threat actors use Ryuk, and the cybersecurity company FireEye said the ""most likely hypothesis"" is that Ryuk operators are Russian cybercriminals, according to the memo. As NBC News has previously reported, Russian cybercriminal groups sometimes work with the Russian government, but in other instances they can work on their own.","Oct. 29, 2020"

Did the feds fix HealthCare.gov? How we’ll know,7309,"Saturday'’s the deadline – it’s the last day of November and the day the Obama administration promised its health insurance website would be working smoothly for “the vast majority” of people. Officials say there won’t be an obvious “before” and ""after” picture of HealthCare.gov. ""November 30 does not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov. It is not a magical date,"" says Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which operates the site. To show how serious they are, CMS took the website down for an extended maintenance from 9 p.m. ET Friday, Nov. 29 to early morning Saturday. Bataille said technicians added new servers to speed up the process. ""The site is performing well today with low overall error rates and response times despite heavier than usual weekend traffic. We are making additional hardware upgrades and software fixes tonight as part of a planned set of improvements to improve speed and reduce errors,"" she said in a blog post. CMS plans another update Sunday. But if you really want to know it's working, look for insurance company ads. So far, insurers have been a little bit quiet about the site which, after all, is supposed to be driving them lots of business. ""As the technical issue get worked out, health plans are going to get more and more engaged,"" says Robert Zirkelbach of America's Health Insurance Plans, meaning they're waiting until it works better before they start a full-court press of ads.  The administration says the site, which crumpled almost as soon as it opened on Oct. 1, is now working for just about everyone. “We’re happy to report that 90 percent of users are now able to create accounts,” the Health and Human Services Department said in a statement Tuesday night. “Two key factors are whether the site can handle the volume of people who are expected to want to enroll through the end of the year and whether the process is smooth and error-free,” says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been monitoring the rollout. “It doesn’t have to work perfectly for everyone.” CMS says it can now handle 50,000 users at the same time, or 800,000 a day, which was the original specification. CMS also cautions that it may not work perfectly for people with complicated situations. But Zirkelbach says the ""back end"" of the site — the part where the policy actually gets bought and paid for — is still rough. ""Health insurers are still seeing enrollments that are duplicated, missing information, things like that,"" he said. And one big piece is missing: so-called direct enrollment. If that ever works as it should, people should be able to go directly to a health insurer's site and sign up with a small detour to HealthCare.gov to see if they are eligible for a subsidy. That function is barely working now. Nonetheless, the government says it is ready for an end-of-the-month rush, combined with a post-Thanksgiving pile-on. “Health care is going to be a popular topic of conversation over the holidays,” Levitt said. The Monday after Thanksgiving has, in the past, been a popular day for people to sign up for Medicare Part D (the prescription drug coverage plan) and Medicare Advantage (Medicare provided by a private insurer) coverage, for example. The White House knows it cannot count on the insurers for now so it's turned to advocacy groups. Organizing for America, which campaigns for President Barack Obama, plans a public relations blitz called “Health Care for the Holidays”. “Are your family members traveling home for the holidays? There are a few things they’ll need to sign up for health coverage,” it advises. Their “packing list’ includes W-2s and Social Security numbers.
 “Don’t forget to follow up: ‘Have you signed up yet?’” it urges. AARP, the group for people over 50, has its own campaign, with e-cards ready to send out to adult children. One choice: “Get health insurance so I can stop pestering you to sign up and start pressuring you to get married.” The White House has asked Democrats to reach out to constituents, and urged them to tell success stories.  The right-leaning Heritage Foundation has counter-programming e-cards. “Let’s be thankful the government doesn’t regulate how much we can eat at Thanksgiving dinner,” one reads. A little worried about all this propaganda working too well, the White House and HHS officials have asked groups like Enroll America and labor unions to hold off on driving traffic to the site until it’s clear what it can handle. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius advised shoppers to ""Shop HealthCare.gov during off-peak hours (mornings/nights/weekends)."" The health insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. They’re the main vehicle for getting insurance coverage to the more than 40 million Americans who don’t have any now. No one expects all those people to sign up on the exchanges, however. The Congressional Budget Office originally projected that 7 million people would sign up for private insurance on the exchanges the first year, with another 9 million signing up for Medicaid in states that are expanding their programs. It’s not clear whether the publicity surrounding the slow start has put a significant number of people off. During the first month the exchanges were open, HHS says about 26,000 people signed up on the federal exchange, operating on behalf of 36 states, while close to 80,000 signed up on the state-run websites.
 Some states say they have done much better since then. New York says 76,177 have signed up on its exchange. “The way we are going to be evaluating success will be based largely on anecdotes,” Levitt says. It may be hard to tell, given that critics of the site have been pushing out tales of woe from people who said they couldn’t sign up, found their insurance premiums were more expensive than they had expected, or found their favorite doctors or hospitals were excluded from the new insurance networks. The White House has countered with first-name-only anecdotes of people who have succeeded in enrolling. Hard new numbers from the administration will come in mid-December, when HHS will release enrollment numbers for November. “More important than how many sign up is who signs up,” Levitt says. Experts agree it will be important to get the right mix of sick vs. well people into the exchange plans. Insurance companies will go broke if they have to cover too many sick people without premiums from healthy people to balance them out.  That’s why there’s been so much attention lavished on the “young invincibles” — young adults who don’t yet have the chronic health conditions that are so expensive to pay for, and who may be wary of shelling out for health insurance.
 The administration’s already had to admit that parts of the system don’t work. On Wednesday, it said small businesses will have to wait until next year to use the exchanges. It’s extended the open enrollment period for people who want health insurance to start on Jan.1 – they get an extra week now, until Dec. 23. But the White House has repeatedly reminded people that they have until March 31 to sign up for insurance to get credit for being covered in 2014 and avoid the tax being levied on those who don’t have health insurance.  Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter.

"Near Obamacare anniversary, Americans will receive greater health care subsidies",4824,"President Joe Biden took a victory lap Friday after the passage of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, and perhaps one of the most significant elements of the law is the massive changes it will make to health care coverage in the United States — the largest since the passage of the Affordable Care Act under the Obama administration. ""For the first time in a long time this bill puts working people in this nation first,"" Biden said in a speech in the Rose Garden. Earlier Friday, senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to freely discuss the specifics of the legislation, elaborated on how the plan will expand health care coverage as well as lower costs by boosting subsidies for those who buy insurance through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act — sometimes also called Obamacare. Americans will be able to access those subsidies on the federal exchange beginning April 1. Key provisions of the law require that Americans pay no more than 8.5 percent of their income on health insurance premiums and provide a larger tax credit to 9 million people who receive financial assistance, helping them afford coverage through the marketplace. Those whose earnings are 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which ekes out to slightly more than $51,500 a year, will be able to receive aid to purchase affordable health care coverage. The Biden administration estimates that, through cost-sharing, Obamacare premiums will decrease on average by $50 per month. One administration official emphasized that four out of five enrollees “will be able to purchase a plan for $10 or less per month” and said it could be significant for the 14.9 million people who are uninsured in the United States. Through the American Rescue Plan, the administration officials said that uninsured couples earning more than $70,000 could save $1,000 per month on their monthly premiums, a family of four making $90,000 will see premiums decrease by $200 per month and an individual making $19,000 will not have to pay a monthly premium. The law makes it so that those who buy their own insurance will automatically become eligible for the new tax credits beginning April 1. Those who sign up for health care coverage after April 1 will automatically be enrolled, but anyone who had a plan beginning prior to that date will have the to update their plan to lower their premiums. More than 200,000 Americans have signed up for coverage since Biden opened up a special enrollment period on February 15. That period continues until May 15. The administration officials stressed that individuals will have to sign up or update their plans to receive the savings, though they said there would also be an opportunity to recoup those subsidies come tax season. Officials said that it was technologically challenging to automatically apply the subsidy, though they are attempting to find avenues to automate that later this year. “The agency is going to be working tirelessly to implement these revisions, make sure that the American people know that they can find quality, affordable coverage on healthcare.gov,” one official said. “And that's whether they are currently enrolled, whether they're currently uninsured or unemployed.” People in those states that have their own health insurance exchanges and don’t use healthcare.gov will still have access to those savings, but they will have to contact their states to get a better idea of their state’s timeline — which could differ. The law also promises to give people who received at least one week of unemployment at any point in 2021 an opportunity to obtain health care coverage with a $0 premium, though it is expected that it will take longer to bring that on board because of the complexity of negotiating that with the states. It is unclear how it could affect people who do not purchase their health insurance on the exchanges, and some are also concerned the subsidies are set to expire in two years if they are not approved by Congress — setting up a potentially huge election battle in 2022. It is also unclear whether any states that haven’t expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act will take up the Biden administration’s offer of covering a larger share of the program, a notable piece of the American Rescue Plan. Twelve states, all controlled by Republican legislatures and most by Republican governors, still have not adopted the provision, leaving millions without coverage. The Biden administration is continuing to work with those states, an official said. Moreover, there is soon to be a massive outreach campaign to educate consumers on the changes and opportunities. “March 23 is the 11th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, and so I think you can expect to see a very big push from us,” one official noted.","March 13, 2021"

4 Alternatives to Offering Paid Healthcare Benefits,4795,"The cost for companies to provide healthcare benefits is at an all-time high, according to a new Towers Watson report. In 2014, healthcare costs reached an average of $9,560 per employee, and that’s just the employer’s share. The Affordable Healthcare Act mandates that companies with 50 or more full-time employees provide health coverage. However, small businesses and startups don’t have to take the same route. Related: The Real Power of Health Insurance Though this new law might make healthcare more expensive to employers, Healthcare.gov does provide many affordable options for individual and family plans. For example, if an employer does not offer coverage, the individual may be eligible for a tax credit. Since the Affordable Healthcare Act is giving consumers more control over their own healthcare, offering healthcare as a benefit might not be as attractive as it once was. In place of providing healthcare as a benefit, consider providing these benefits instead: 1. Pay enough to help cover costs of personal plans Though healthcare costs are rising for employers, it doesn’t necessarily mean employees will have the same experience with a personal or family plan. Instead of taking out plans for the whole company, give everyone a boost in salary or an annual bonus to help cover the cost of employees’ personal insurance plans. 2. Opportunities to work remotely We’re entering an age where the workforce is starting to get picky. Why? It’s increasingly being flooded by millennials who grew up alongside the Internet, mobile technology and access to any information on demand from virtually anywhere. Not surprising, but the younger workforce actually cares more about freedom in the workplace than other benefits renowned by Baby Boomers, including healthcare. A 2013 study by PwC, the University of Southern California, and the London Business School found flexibility in where and how much millennials work has a big impact on job satisfaction. To remedy this, more companies are offering the option for employees to work remotely either part-time or full-time. A 2013 World At Work survey reports that telework is now offered by 88 percent of organizations. One-third of organizations offer telework on a full-time basis. This allows 54 percent of organizations to offer a more flexible schedule to employees. Instead of healthcare, consider offering employees the option to work from home once a week, or one week per month, depending on the schedule that tasks demand. Employees, especially millennials, will have more freedom that seems more important than health insurance coming from an employer. Related: How to Attract -- And Retain -- Staff When You Can't Pay Big Bucks 3. More flex/vacation time Instead of offering healthcare to supplement the medical expenses that may be incurred due to workplace stress, treat the source. Play a part in helping reduce workplace stress so employees will be healthier in the first place. A  2013 study published by the Canadian Center of Science and Education  found that offering employees flexible work hours not only reduced stress and absenteeism, but also improved morale and motivation. When employees have the freedom to balance work and home life, overall well-being is improved. A healthy well-being means less frequent illnesses and, therefore, less frequent doctor visits and medications to subdue the harmful effects stress from work has on the body. 4. Creative perks to inspire innovation By 2025, 75 percent of the workforce will be made up of millennials. Companies are going to have to make a few adjustments to ensure employee retention. Along with offering more freedom and autonomy in the workplace, companies will need to be creative to hold millennial interest. In fact, a Deloitte study reveals 78 percent of millennials are influenced by how innovative a company is when deciding where to work. To millennials, healthcare now pales in comparison to perks like catered meals, attraction tickets, and even fun workplace environments like the ones offered by Apple, Google and other companies known for innovation. While it might not be realistic to open a cafe in the office building, try filling the break room with snacks and refreshments. Once a month, organize a catered office lunch. Employers in the service industry can build relationships with entertainment companies such as theme parks and movie theaters to see if service trades are an option. It’s possible that, in the next 10 years, offering healthcare as a benefit may be irrelevant given the new freedom individuals have with adopting personal healthcare plans. Just as the workforce is changing, companies should adapt and be aware of the benefits that might be more pertinent to employees. Related: Putting a Price Tag on Employee Fitness","Oct. 14, 2014"
Here's How Trump Would Replace Obamacare,3225,"Donald Trump released his health care plan Wednesday evening, finally detailing the way in which he would fulfill his campaign trail promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. In a seven-point plan posted to his website and publicized by a tweet, Trump says he will do away with the individual health insurance mandate, as well as allow competition over states lines for health care plans, and block grant Medicaid to the states, allowing them to follow through on his prescription to “eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources."" The decision to go against the idea of an individual mandate is new for Trump, who told CNN during a February town hall before the South Carolina primary that he “likes the mandate” and that makes him “a little bit different” than other conservatives. But Wednesday’s plan outlines as the first point on the list: ""Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to."" He counters that, however, by saying individuals should be allowed to “fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns.” The third bullet point goes on to say that “we must make sure no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance” and that “we must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it."" Further, Trump ties illegal immigration to his healthcare plan, writing “providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually ... If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments.” Trump, who after almost every mass shooting has responded to questions on gun control with an answer about mental health, also noted the need for mental health institution reform. His plan states that “[f]amilies, without the ability to get the information needed to help those who are ailing, are too often not given the tool to help their loved ones.” Beyond this statement, however, Trump gives no solution. Instead, writing that “there are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support.” Another recent talking point that has made its way into the healthcare plan is pharmaceutical drugs, special interest control of prices, and the need to be able to negotiate. Though this talking point seemed to stem from former Bush finance chairman Woody Johnson’s attendance to a GOP debate, Trump has since included the need to negotiate prices and unleash Washington from its special interest hold. The final point in his plan states the need to “[R]emove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products.” Trump says that ""Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America” and that despite pharmaceuticals being private companies, they “provide a public service.” Trump instead is advocating for international competition and the importing of drugs from overseas to ""bring more options to consumers.”","March 3, 2016"
Trump readies major change in health care without Congress,2714,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump teased an upcoming executive order on health care on Tuesday, potentially setting up a new front in the Obamacare wars that experts worry could destabilize insurance markets. ""With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,"" Trump said at a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, referring to the inability of lawmakers to pass health care reform. ""So we'll be announcing that soon as far as the signing is concerned. But it's largely worked out."" Trump offered few details, other than saying that the order would allow people to ""cross state lines"" to purchase health insurance and that it would ""take care of a big percentage of the people we’re talking about"" who have been dissatisfied with their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Trump joked that it was necessary to protect Kissinger, who is 94, from paying the rising cost of individual plans under Obamacare. ""Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116 percent increase in his premiums, but that's what's happening,"" the president said. (As a U.S. citizen over 65, however, Kissinger qualifies for Medicare, making the issue moot in his case.) Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tweeted on Tuesday that he has been working with the White House on the plan. Ideas under consideration, according to a Wall Street Journal report, include making association plans for trade groups and businesses available to more individuals. Another plan is to allow people to purchase short-term catastrophic insurance for longer periods. Depending on the White House's moves, the order could allow many customers to buy cheaper but less comprehensive plans, potentially avoiding regulations in their state on what treatments insurers must cover and how much they can charge people with pre-existing conditions. Such moves could create less expensive options for healthier customers who earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies, but, by drawing them away from the Obamacare exchanges, the changes could cause premiums for sicker patients to spike and potentially cause some insurers to abandon the individual market entirely. Insurance companies can already sell plans across states lines under Obamacare if the states in question allow it, but they must meet minimum standards of coverage; insurers have not lined up to use the provision. Insurers and state regulators have already complained they are raising premiums next year on the Obamacare exchanges in part because of uncertainty over the White House's approach to the law. The administration is drastically scaling back advertising and outreach campaigns to enroll people during the next enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1 and concludes Dec. 15.","Oct. 11, 2017"
Dow falls 100 points as healthcare vote sends jitters down Wall Street,2436,"The Dow Jones industrial average traded 100 points lower on Friday amid growing concerns that the GOP may not be able to push through the American Health Care Act. ""There are many doubts about whether or not it will pass in the House,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. ""We all know that Trump has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare, and if his efforts fail and the bill doesn't get approved, we could have a major problem."" House Speaker Paul Ryan went to the White House to speak with President Donald Trump about the bill Friday afternoon, around the time when stocks pulled back. Treasurys rose, as the benchmark 10-year note yield dipped below 2.4 percent. ""No vote means buy bonds,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital. ""If we price out the positive momentum the bill appeared to have and we question what this means for other reforms, and trump's overall level of political capital that would be constructive for the Treasury market."" “From an economic perspective, there really isn't that much juice here,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. ""The bigger issue here is political. Right now, this is a 'put up or shut up' moment for Republicans because they have been talking about this for years."" The House vote is crucial for the Trump agenda. Trump has said the repeal and replacement of Obamacare must happen before action can be taken on his other plans, including a major tax reduction. Expectations for such policies had been a boon for the stock market's postelection rally. Republicans need 215 votes to pass the health-care proposal because one Democrat is expected to be absent. Stocks suffered their worst day of the year earlier this week, in part, because of the concerns surrounding the health-care vote. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 indexes on Tuesday recorded their first 1 percent declines since Oct. 11. ""The mounting anticipation ahead of the delayed health-care vote later today has created an unnatural calm across the financial markets with investors adopting a cautious approach,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. ""While Trump has threatened that without a vote to the healthcare bill he will move on to other agendas, markets may interpret a potential failure today as something that could create some headwinds for the pending tax reforms and infrastructure spending,"" he said.","March 25, 2017"
Hackers: HealthCare.gov still riddled with potential security issues,5824,"Cybersecurity researchers slammed HealthCare.gov's security during a House hearing on Thursday, saying the site is still riddled with problems that could put consumers' sensitive health details at risk. “The reason we’re concluding that this is so shockingly bad is that the issues across the site are so varied,” David Kennedy, founder of the information security firm TrustedSec, told NBC News. “You don’t even have to hack into the system to see big issues – which means there are [major problems] underneath.” Kennedy was the first of a group of so-called ""white-hat hackers"" who testified before the House of Representatives Science Committee on Thursday. He previously testified on November 19, when he said he was able to identify 18 major issues with the site – without even hacking into it. “Nothing’s really changed since our November 19 testimony,” Kennedy said during the hearing. “In fact, it’s worse.” Only half of one of those 18 issues on HealthCare.gov has been fixed since that November meeting, Kennedy said, and he has since learned of more problems with the site. A separate House Oversight committee hearing held Thursday included testimony from government officials including Teresa Fryer, the chief information officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS), which manages HealthCare.gov. According to Fryer, HealthCare.gov passed a “security control assessment” on December 18 with “no open high findings.” But she and the other officials faced a grilling from the panel about why more tests were not completed earlier, and why warnings about the site’s launch were not heeded. ‘Critical or high-risk findings’
At the Science Committee hearing, TrustedSec’s Kennedy said he isn’t disclosing the specifics of how those vulnerabilities work, as they are active issues that hackers could exploit. But Kennedy did cite issues including the disclosure of user profiles, as well as the ability to access eligibility reports without appropriate credentials.
 “Some issues still include critical or high-risk findings to personal information,” Kennedy said in his written testimony. He also submitted statements from seven other security researchers who expressed serious concerns. CMS released a separate statement Thursday in response to Kennedy’s report, insisting the agency takes security concerns seriously and has a “robust system in place” to address potential issues. “To date, there have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site,” CMS said in the statement, adding that it continually conducts security testing on the site. The Science Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), also heard testimony from Michael Gregg, the CEO of security consulting firm Superior Solutions. Gregg discussed concerns about Healthcare.gov “going up fast,” comparing the process with those of private companies like Microsoft that roll out products. He also warned HealthCare.gov contains a data goldmine. “Hacking today is big business,” Gregg told the committee. When questioned by the panel, Gregg and Kennedy both said they would not put their personal information on HealthCare.gov. The third of the three cybersecurity researchers on the panel disagreed. Waylon Krush, CEO of the security firm Lunarline, said he would put his information on the site. Lunarline has worked with federal clients, and Krush used his written testimony to lay out the six-step process that federal information systems use to mitigate risk. He also criticized Kennedy and Gregg for engaging in what he called speculation, pointing out that “no one at this table” was involved in the setup and management of HealthCare.gov. “Just as security critics lack the hands on knowledge necessary to make dramatic claims … I cannot claim to understand all of Healthcare.gov's security intricacies,” Krush said in his written testimony. Gregg argued that a third party should be assigned to do just that: plumb the depths of the site and figure out a way to fix the problems through “an independent assessment.” ‘A house on a bad foundation’
Another security researcher, who was not a part of the committee hearing, was not as optimistic. “If you build a house on a bad foundation and it’s sinking into a swamp, it’s really hard to pick up the house and rebuild the foundation,” said Alex McGeorge, a senior security researcher at Immunity Inc. Companies hire Immunity to hack into their own systems and show vulnerabilities.
 “Security isn’t a bolt-on,” McGeorge said. “It’s not easy to retrofit once you have a system up and running.” This week the Obama Administration booted the original IT contractor, CGI Federal, that managed Healthcare.gov. CGI Federal’s contract will not be renewed in February, and Accenture will take over instead. “From a security standpoint, one of the things that’s so interesting about this site is that it’s so dynamic -- and it’s changing quickly,” McGeorge said. “You’ve got so many hands in the pot.” Unfortunately, “that is the exact opposite of how you create a secure site,” McGeorge said.  There’s also an upside to the ever-changing nature of Healthcare.gov and its stewards: When the site is constantly shifting, it’s tougher for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities they found previously. “It’s harder to hit a moving target,” McGeorge said. “But a moving target also makes more mistakes.” NBC News’ Katie Wall contributed to this report.

Have you put off healthcare during Covid-19? 4 ways women can abandon shame at the doctor’s office,4065,"Sarah is my patient. She is a 48-year old educator and mother of three with hypertension, heartburn and knee pain. Her medical problems have been shelved for over a year. Caring for her elderly parents and shepherding her kids through virtual school have added a new level of stress. To cope, she has been overeating at night, relying on alcohol to relax and guzzling coffee to stay alert. Her medical problems have subsequently flared. She’s put on weight. Her knees ache. Her Ibuprofen use and coffee habit are exacerbating her acid reflux. Adding insult to injury, she’s ashamed to admit to herself — and to me — that she’s struggling. How could she not feel undone? Covid-19 has stolen lives and taken jobs. It has caused widespread economic and social upheaval. It has disrupted our routines, challenged our relationships and put self-care last on the to-do list. Women, in particular, have endured unique challenges during this global pandemic. We are caring for our kids, parents and households. We are working more and sleeping less. As caregivers, we tend to prioritize the needs of others over ourselves and inadvertently set ourselves up for distress. Yet my patients commonly enter my office with peri-pandemic remorse, embarrassed they’ve gained weight, sheepish about their alcohol use, apologizing for missing their mammogram. I get it. The problem is this: it’s time for a checkup. It’s time to put our health at the top of the list. It’s time to leave shame at the door. Here’s my prescription for you: We are wired for survival. When faced with a threat like Covid-19, our bodies naturally release stress hormones — cortisol and adrenaline — into our bloodstream. These neurochemicals allow us to run from danger; they can also make us feel anxious and sick. From jitteriness and heart palpitations to fatigue and insomnia, a body under stress can feel simultaneously wired and tired. When we understand the natural human reaction to stress and normalize our feelings, we can start to remove the stigma of suffering. No one is immune to the stress of the pandemic, doctors and healthcare workers included. No one had a playbook for the pandemic. Each of us is struggling in some way. When we name and normalize the emotional, behavioral, and physical manifestations of our lives upended, we can start to accept help. A doctor’s job is to provide a safe, non-judgmental space. It is to help you pivot from fear-based decision-making to fact-based behaviors by establishing trust, providing evidence-based advice, and acknowledging your unique social and emotional inputs. It is to reframe weight gain, for example, as a symptom of stress, not a sign of weakness. It is to provide nuanced guidance to manage the root causes of medical problems. Asking for help is a sign of strength. Accepting it opens the door to bettering your health. Your doctor is there to provide structure and support. When you get the advice and tools you need, you can start to take control of your health. When you replace fear with facts, you make healthier decisions. Bring your whole self to the doctor. Vulnerability is the birthplace of health. When we acknowledge our suffering and identify how our everyday stress affects how we think, eat, sleep, and relate to other people, we can begin to heal from the inside out. Instead of shaming and blaming ourselves, let’s acknowledge our lived experiences. Unmasking our internal reality and addressing the emotional roots of our physical issues offers us the opportunity to be healthier from the ground up. Our health is in the balance – always, but this year every more urgently. Let’s treat ourselves with the empathy and kindness we deserve. Our health and well-being depend on it.

"No major security breaches on HealthCare.gov, Democrats say",2447,"Only a few people have tried to hack into the HealthCare.gov website and no one has successfully stolen any information, Democrats in the House of Representatives said Friday.
 They released parts of a classified briefing they got earlier this week from the Health and Human Services Department saying 32 security incidents had been logged since the website rolled out Oct. 1. Republicans in Congress have been asking questions about website security, since people must enter Social Security numbers and other personal information to enroll in health insurance on the site. Included was a widely publicized case in which a North Carolina man inadvertently was sent information from a South Carolina man’s account, and 14 other incidents of what was described as accidental access to someone else’s information. “On December 11, in order to address ongoing questions, committee members and staff received a classified briefing from Dr. Kevin Charest, the HHS Chief Information Security Officer, and Ned Holland, HHS Assistant Secretary for Administration,” Reps. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who is ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Colorado Democrat Diana DeGette wrote in a statement. “The briefing revealed that there have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov. According to Dr. Charest, no person or group has hacked into Healthcare.gov, and no person or group has maliciously accessed any personally identifiable information from users.” DeGette and Waxman said none of the incidents “involved a significant breach of personal information."" ""All the known glitches that caused these incidents have been fixed,"" they added.
 Separately, Politifact awarded President Barack Obama the “Lie of the Year” for his promise that people who like their health insurance plans could keep them. “Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief,” Politifact said.
 Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee say nearly 6 million people have had their policies canceled. Obama has apologized for his promise, but independent analysts note that policies on the individual market are frequently canceled, often lasting just six months or a year, and that some of them provided very little coverage in return for the premiums paid. ·      Follow NBCNewsHealth on Facebook and on Twitter  ·      Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter","Dec. 14, 2013"

"As vaccine mandates spread, protests follow — some spurred by nurses",8727,"A few hundred protesters lined the sidewalk Monday outside Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego to rally against California’s impending vaccination mandates for health care workers. And to the disappointment of many medical professionals, some of the protesters were nurses wearing hospital scrubs. It was the kind of protest that was common earlier in the pandemic but lost steam this year as restrictions eased. But a resurgent coronavirus and sluggish vaccine uptake have led to a push for vaccination mandates and masking rules — and renewed protests. Vaccination mandates have given new focus to some Covid deniers and anti-vaccination activists, helping to align disparate “liberty” groups around a single cause, as lockdowns did earlier in the pandemic. Among them are nurses who have been vocal opponents of various pandemic mitigation efforts, some of whom have become adept at garnering social media attention, mainly on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. It’s a dynamic that experts warn can have an outsize impact on vaccination discourse, particularly as the nurses’ messages can go far beyond the protests or their limited social media audiences and carry a veneer of medical industry credibility. “It’s not that the nurses necessarily themselves have a really big reach, but their videos always seem to be found by people who are anti-vax, who then duet or reshare it and use the credibility of that medical professional to bolster the argument that they’ve been correct all along,” said Rachel Moran, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public who studies misinformation on the internet. The protest in San Diego, where some participants chanted repurposed pro-abortion rights slogans like “our body, our choice,” was one of more than a dozen organized outside California hospitals in recent days, organized by a group called America’s Healthcare Workers for Medical Freedom and promoted through a new, anonymous Instagram account with 5,500 followers made up of a stable of registered nurses who are also anti-vaccination influencers on the app.   Other recent protests have gotten similar boosts on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Calling themselves “freedom keepers,” at least six individual accounts have spent the last week promoting America’s Healthcare Workers for Medical Freedom protests, posting flyers for rallies, among other posts, which feature vaccination misinformation dressed in a feminine aesthetic well-known to wellness and lifestyle influencers, including pastel colors and trendy cursive fonts.  The individual accounts present a hodgepodge of vaccination misinformation, including distorted data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, to suggest that the vaccines are killing thousands of people.  A Facebook spokesperson said the company was looking into the accounts and would take action if they violated the company's policies. As part of a sweeping set of mandates across the state, California’s Public Health Department has required its more than 2 million health care workers in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and doctor’s offices to be fully vaccinated against Covid by Sept. 30. The pop-up protests come at a time when hospitals throughout the country are increasingly implementing mandates to combat stalled vaccination efforts among health care workers, even as the delta variant threatens to overload intensive care units again.  Like other protests against lockdowns, masks and other measures to mitigate Covid’s spread, the events, ostensibly for health care workers, attracted other participants, including some who are stringently against all childhood vaccinations and others who are seemingly politically motivated to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom. In livestreams from this week’s events, the protesters’ signs, which included QAnon slogans and the text of the Nuremberg Code (a guideline for ethical medical research), gave clues to the myriad motivations of participants.  The small but vocal group of activists behind America’s Healthcare Workers for Medical Freedom include the account’s newsletter host, Lauren Mochizuki, an emergency room nurse and personal finance blogger in Orange County, California, who also runs the Instagram account nurses4informedconsent, a private account with just 1,800 followers. Mochizuki, who made news at the start of the pandemic for bringing attention to the struggle of front-line health care workers, did not reply to a request for comment.  Heather Knapp, 35, a registered home health nurse in Riverside, California, posted videos from several of the protests to her 33,000-follower Instagram account, Nurses4freedom. She said the recent rallies were an effort to bring awareness to the concerns of health care professionals who, despite the scientific consensus, question the safety of vaccines.  “I’m not an anti-vaxxer,” Knapp said. “Our organization is anti-mandate.” Health care workers have never been immune from anti-vaccination views. Online groups like Nurses Against Mandatory Vaccines were early participants in the modern anti-vaccination movement and have been known to rally behind health care professionals who refuse yearly flu shots. Since the pandemic began, Covid and vaccine misinformation has permeated mainstream nursing groups and led professional groups like the American Nurses Association to announce support for the vaccines and warn against online misinformation that erodes public trust.  Moran said viral videos of anti-vaccination nurses are “leveraging the credibility of medical professionals” to create a false impression that there is considerable debate about Covid vaccines among doctors and nurses when, in reality, there is a consensus about their efficacy and safety. “There’s a hypocritical argument where anti-vaxxers for a long time have spread distrust in institutions and science and medicine,” Moran said. “But on the flip side, when there is a doctor or someone with an advanced degree or medical experience who says something that aligns with their anti-vax message — suddenly that institutional expertise is credible again.” Knapp said that she and others were concerned about unknown “long-term safety effects,” including to women’s fertility, and that information about treatments like ivermectin, a drug used to prevent parasites in animals, was being “censored.” Knapp also said her organization was expanding to include firefighters and law enforcement agents.  “We’re not giving in,” she said, adding that more rallies in additional states were scheduled for next week.  While more than 96 percent of practicing doctors in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated, according to an American Medical Association survey, some other health care workers are more hesitant. One in 4 hospital workers with direct contact with patients had not received a single dose of a Covid vaccine by the end of May, according to a WebMD and Medscape Medical News estimate using data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some health care workers are going online to evade the impending mandates. In HealthCare Workers for Freedom, a new, separate private Facebook group with 3,000 members, self-identified health care workers offer support and trade tips for filing requests for religious exemptions and contacts for lawyers who would represent vaccine refusers. The group was buzzing Wednesday morning about a proposed walkout to protest the mandates, although some members expressed hesitation. “I hope no one is abandoning patients to walk out,” a member posted. Facebook and its photo-sharing app, Instagram, have struggled to curb the spread of misinformation about vaccines on both platforms, despite numerous policy updates and other measures aimed at removing anti-vaccination content. TikTok has similarly tried to limit the spread of misinformation, but the app has also become an important outlet for people looking to push back against mandates and spread vaccine hesitancy. Moran said the nurses are consistently going viral on TikTok, which anti-vaccination influencers scour for credible-seeming messengers and where use TikTok’s sharing function, called “dueting,” to expand their audiences. Moran said TikTok creates a vicious cycle of disinformation and debunking on TikTok. The nurses’ videos are debunked by well-meaning users in duets, which are then rebutted by anti-vaccination proponents, creating a false sense of ambiguity and debate about the vaccines’ safety. “At the end of the day, all it does is push this impression that there is this 1:1 argument that’s going on where 50 percent of nurses agree with this and 50 percent don’t, and it’s nothing of the sort,” Moran said.","Aug. 12, 2021"
McCain's complicated health care legacy: He hated Obamacare. He also saved it.,8114,"Many lawmakers made their names in health care, seeking to usher through historic changes to a broken system. John McCain was not one of them. And yet, the six-term senator from Arizona and decorated military veteran leaves behind his own health care legacy, seemingly driven less by his interest in health care policy than by his disdain for bullies trampling the “little guy.” He was not always successful. While McCain was instrumental in the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, most of the health initiatives he undertook failed after running afoul of traditional Republican priorities. His prescriptions often involved more government regulation and increased taxes. In 2008, as the Republican nominee for president, he ran on a health care platform that dumbfounded many in his party, who worried that it would raise taxes on top of overhauling the U.S. tradition of workplace insurance. Many will remember McCain as the incidental savior of the Affordable Care Act. His late-night thumbs-down vote halted his party’s most promising effort to overturn a major Democratic achievement — the signature achievement, in fact, of the Democrat who beat him to become president. It was a vote that earned him regular — and biting — admonishments from President Donald Trump. McCain died Saturday, following a battle with brain cancer. He was 81. Coincidentally, his Senate colleague and good friend Ted Kennedy died on the same date, Aug. 25, nine years ago, succumbing to the same type of rare brain tumor. Whether indulging in conspiracy theories or wishful thinking, some have attributed McCain’s vote on the ACA in July 2017 to a change of heart shortly after his terminal cancer diagnosis. But McCain spent much of his 35 years in Congress fighting a never-ending supply of goliaths, among them health insurance companies, the tobacco industry and, in his estimation, the Affordable Care Act, a law that extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans but did not solve the system’s ballooning costs. His prey were the sort of boogeymen that made for compelling campaign ads in a career stacked with campaigns. But McCain was “always for the little guy,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the chief domestic policy adviser on McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “John’s idea of empathy is saying to you, ‘I’ll punch the bully for you,’ ” he said in an interview before McCain’s death. McCain’s distaste for President Barack Obama’s health care law was no secret. While he agreed that the health care system was broken, he did not think more government involvement would fix it. Like most Republicans, he campaigned in his last Senate race on a promise to repeal and replace the law with something better. After Republicans spent months bickering amongst themselves about which was better, McCain was disappointed in the option presented to senators hours before their vote: hobble the ACA and trust that a handful of lawmakers would be able to craft an alternative behind closed doors, despite failing to accomplish that very thing after years of trying. What bothered McCain more, though, was his party’s strategy to pass their so-called skinny repeal measure, skipping committee consideration and delivering it straight to the floor. They also rejected any input from the opposing party, a tactic for which he had slammed Democrats when the ACA passed in 2010 without a single GOP vote. He lamented that Republican leaders had cast aside compromise-nurturing Senate procedures in pursuit of political victory. In his 2018 memoirs, “The Restless Wave,” McCain said even Obama called to express gratitude for McCain’s vote against the Republican repeal bill. “I was thanked for my vote by Democratic friends more profusely than I should have been for helping save Obamacare,” McCain wrote. “That had not been my goal.” Better known for his work on campaign finance reform and the military, McCain did have a hand in one landmark health bill — the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the country’s first comprehensive civil rights law that addressed the needs of those with disabilities. An early co-sponsor of the legislation, he championed the rights of the disabled, speaking of the service members and civilians he met in his travels who had become disabled during military conflict. McCain himself had limited use of his arms because of injuries inflicted while he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, though he was quicker to talk about the troubles of others than his own when advocating policy. Yet two of his biggest bills on health care ended in defeat. In 1998, McCain introduced a sweeping bill that would regulate the tobacco industry and increase taxes on cigarettes, hoping to discourage teenagers from smoking and raise money for research and related health care costs. It faltered under opposition from his fellow Republicans. McCain also joined an effort with two Democratic senators, Kennedy of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, to pass a patients’ bill of rights in 2001. He resisted at first, concerned in particular about the right it gave patients to sue health care companies, said Sonya Elling, who served as a health care aide in McCain’s office for about a decade. But he came around. “It was the human, the personal aspect of it, basically,” said Elling, now senior director of federal affairs at Eli Lilly. “It was providing him some of the real stories about how people were being hurt and some of the barriers that existed for people in the current system.” The legislation would have granted patients with private insurance the right to emergency and specialist care in addition to the right to seek redress for being wrongly denied care. But President George W. Bush threatened to veto the measure, claiming that it would fuel frivolous lawsuits. The bill failed. McCain’s health care efforts bolstered his reputation as a lawmaker willing to work across the aisle. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, now the Senate’s Democratic leader, sought his help on legislation in 2001 to expand access to generic drugs. In 2015, McCain led a bipartisan coalition to pass a law that would strengthen mental health and suicide prevention programs for veterans, one of several veterans’ care measures he undertook. It was McCain’s relationship with Kennedy that stood out, inspiring eerie comparisons when McCain was diagnosed last year with glioblastoma — a form of brain cancer — shortly before his vote saved the Affordable Care Act. That same aggressive brain cancer killed Kennedy in 2009, months before the passage of the law that helped realize his work to secure better access for Americans to health care. “I had strenuously opposed it, but I was very sorry that Ted had not lived to see his long crusade come to a successful end,” McCain wrote in his 2018 book. While some of his biggest health care measures failed, the experiences helped burnish McCain’s résumé for his 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns. In 2007, trailing other favored Republicans, such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in early polling and fundraising, McCain asked his advisers to craft a health care proposal, said Holtz-Eakin. It was an unusual move for a Republican presidential primary. The result was a remarkable plan that would eliminate the tax break employers get for providing health benefits to workers, known as the employer exclusion, and replace it with refundable tax credits to help people — not just those working in firms that supplied coverage — buy insurance individually. He argued that employer-provided plans were driving up costs, as well as keeping salaries lower. The plan was controversial, triggering “a total freakout” when McCain gained more prominence and scrutiny, Holtz-Eakin said. But McCain stood by it. “He might not have been a health guy, but he knew how important that was,” he said. “And he was relentless about getting it done.” Kaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.

Health care experts say coronavirus exposes major flaws in medical system,7219,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues its rampage across the United States, with more than a million confirmed cases and no end in sight, medical professionals and experts say the strain on the health care system has exposed major flaws and taught hard lessons. They said the pandemic has shown that we need to shift the way we think about health care as overwhelmed hospitals struggle to treat the surge in patients and lack enough personal protective equipment to keep workers safe. ""We essentially have built a health care system that is perfectly right-sized for the care that was delivered yesterday, with totally just-in-time supply chains because we value efficiency,"" said Dr. Brendan Carr, chair of emergency medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. ""And what just happened to us is we got caught out on that, and it became very, very clear that we weren't ready for an unexpected bump in the night."" In New York City, he said, ""it took two weeks, three weeks, until we totally broke the financial model of health care."" Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Health care experts urged the industry to heed the tough lessons learned during the pandemic for the future of medicine, and they called for a change in financial incentives, a more national and global approach to public health, the creation of an efficient manufacturing and distribution system for critical supplies, and a continued increase in the use of telemedicine. Carr said that in New York City, the center of the virus in the U.S., there has been ""a total pause on almost everything that we understand as health care,"" including scheduled outpatient visits, procedures and operations, as well as chemotherapy treatments — which are major revenue streams for hospitals. He said primary care was a low-margin to negative-margin business for hospitals, while ""fancy operations and cancer therapy and things of that nature are high margins, what makes health care systems stable to offset the losses from primary care."" A change in how health care businesses are run would likely be determined either by congressional action or by creating payment incentives for hospitals, Carr said. If there were a congressional bailout for health care systems and business resumed as normal, he said, some systems would stockpile more, and some might be more mindful about workflows and increasing social distancing in facilities. ""But I've got to tell you that feels like moving deck chairs around on the Titanic to me,"" he said. ""Those are responses to a broken system, and the big fixes that are out there can't be done at the hospital level. They have to be done either with regulatory reform or through payment reform."" Dr. Hardeep Singh, a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, said hospitals have also typically run at near-maximum capacity and do not want to have excess beds because of financial incentives. ""But that has cost us in terms of problems in this day and age, so I think preparedness and having that surge capacity going forward"" would be critical in the future, he said. ""We generally in health care do things reactively, and I think what this episode has taught us is we need to be a lot more proactive,"" he said. Singh said the pandemic has showed that the U.S. should ""absolutely"" start relying more on domestic manufacturing of lifesaving personal protective equipment and ventilators, which were in short supply and high demand from manufacturers in China. In addition, it is critical to have effective distribution channels and national data sharing, he said. ""We just don't have a national or regional sort of spine of all the data elements that we need to figure out where do we allocate resources next,"" he said. Singh stressed the importance of building a public health infrastructure in which the U.S. could identify which areas and hot spots will need the most supplies. The national infrastructure could also be used in future crises. ""You don't know what's going to affect us five or 10 years down the line,"" he said. Dr. Paul Biddinger, director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Disaster Medicine, said he expected many health care systems, including his own, to start stockpiling equipment. He also hopes to see major changes at the national level in the distribution of supplies. ""In this arena, we have to have an excess capacity for events exactly like this, treating it like a national health security issue, just like we would with military supplies to defend the nation. This is a version of protecting the nation,"" he said. Patricia Davidson, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, said the pandemic also showed the need for more national and global governance in public health. Davidson cited states' creating competition when they individually tried to buy protective equipment and ventilators, which drove up prices and left them scrambling. ""I really hope that we'll be able to learn some really important lessons and people can collaboratively come together to make better solutions,"" she said. Regional or national coordination of stockpiles of equipment or ventilators would be a challenge, she said, and it is important to develop a system that would allow for ""considered management of inventory and rotating things out."" ""This is a really complex undertaking, but what's clear is individual, small, stand-alone community hospitals can't deal with this,"" she said. Download the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak The speed with which the virus became a worldwide outbreak also highlights the need for more global governance in health care and the empowerment of agencies like the World Health Organization, Davidson said. ""There needs to be a realization that we're each on the planet interconnected. Viruses don't know borders,"" she said. The experts said the speed with which the medical system had to adapt to the pandemic led the health care industry to boost access to telemedicine. ""I think medical care in so many different ways will be transformed with the really increased use of telemedicine,"" Biddinger said. ""I think this hopefully will be better for patients and for providers for the subset of visitors where you don't really need to physically come in to see your doctor."" Biddinger also hopes increased attention to hand hygiene and increased use of protective equipment could reduce the spread of infectious diseases within hospitals. ""Even in the medical setting, lots of people took a reasonably casual approach to personal protective equipment,"" he said. ""They weren't quite as careful about how they took off their gloves or gowns or their masks. They weren't quite as good at hand hygiene. ""I think that's now pretty ingrained in a lot of people. There's a possibility we could see a decrease in hospital-acquired infections, which would be fantastic,"" he said. But other learned social behaviors could have negative impacts in the long term, Singh said. ""People have been afraid to go into health care [facilities] even if they have actually alarming symptoms, and we're afraid that people would be getting harmed sitting at home and not seeking treatment,"" Singh said.","April 29, 2020"
Health care industry spends $30 billion a year on marketing,5890,"Spending on health care marketing nearly doubled from 1997 to 2016, soaring to at least $30 billion a year, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA. “Marketing drives more testing. It drives more treatments,"" said Steven Woloshin, the study co-author and co-director of the Center for Medicine and Media at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. ""It’s a big part of why health care is so expensive, because it’s the fancy, high-tech stuff things that get marketed."" His study captured only a portion of the many ways that drug companies, hospitals and labs promote themselves. Advertising doesn’t just persuade people to pick one brand over another, said Woloshin. Sophisticated campaigns make people worry about diseases they don’t have and ask for drugs or exams they don’t need. Consumer advocates say taxpayers pay the real price, as seductive ads persuade doctors and patients alike to order pricey tests and brand-name pills. “Whenever pharma or a hospital spends money on advertising, we the patients pay for it — through higher prices for drugs and hospital services,” said Shannon Brownlee, senior vice president of the Lown Institute, a Brookline, Massachusetts, nonprofit that advocates for affordable care. “Marketing is built into the cost of care.” High costs ultimately affect everyone, because they prompt insurance plans to raise premiums, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit that provides medical information to consumers. And taxpayers foot the bill for publicly funded insurance programs, such as Medicare. “These ads can be amazingly persuasive, and they can exploit desperate patients and family members,” said Zuckerman, who was not involved in the new study. Drug companies spend the bulk of their money trying to influence doctors, showering them with free food, drinks and speaking fees, as well as paying for them to travel to conferences, according to the study. Yet marketers also increasingly target consumers, said Woloshin, who wrote the study with his wife and longtime research partner, Dartmouth’s Dr. Lisa Schwartz, who died of cancer in November. The biggest increase in medical marketing over the past 20 years was in “direct to consumer” advertising, including the TV commercials that exhort viewers to “ask your doctor” about a particular drug. Spending on such ads jumped from $2.1 billion in 1997 to nearly $10 billion in 2016, according to the study. Holly Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said its ads provide “scientifically accurate information to patients.” These ads “increase awareness of the benefits and risks of new medicines and encourage appropriate use of medicines,” she said. The makers of genetic tests — including those that allow people to learn their ancestry or disease risk —also bombard the public with advertising. The number of ads for genetic testing grew from 14,100 in 1997 to 255,300 in 2016, at a cost that year of $82.6 million, according to the study. AncestryDNA spends more than any other company of its kind, devoting $38 million to marketing in 2016 alone. Some companies are touting stem cell treatments that haven’t been approved by federal regulators. The Food and Drug Administration has approved stem cell therapy for only a few specific uses — such as bone marrow transplants for people with leukemia. But hundreds of clinics claim to use these cells taken from umbilical cord blood to treat disease. Many patients have no idea that these stem cell therapies are unapproved, said Angie Botto-van Bemden, director of osteoarthritis programs at the Arthritis Foundation. Stem cell clinics have boosted their marketing from $900,000 in 2012 to $11.3 million in 2016, according to the study. In recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings to clinics marketing unapproved stem cell therapies. Twelve patients have been hospitalized for serious infections after receiving stem cell injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medical advertising today goes beyond TV and radio commercials. Some online campaigns encourage patients to diagnose themselves, Woloshin said. The website for Restasis, which treats dry eyes, prompts patients to take a quiz to learn if they need the prescription eye drops, said Woloshin, who wrote a February study with Schwartz on the drug’s marketing strategy. The Restasis website also allows patients to “find an eye doctor near you.” Many of the doctors included in the Restasis directory have taken gifts from its manufacturer, Allergan, Woloshin said. The doctor directory includes seven of the top 10 physicians paid by the company, his study says. In a statement, Allergan spokeswoman Amy Rose said the company uses direct-to-consumer advertising “to support responsible disease awareness efforts.” The ads “do not displace the patient/physician relationship, but enhance them, helping to create a well-informed and empowered consumer and patient communities.” But drug sites don’t just lead patients to doctors, Woloshin said. They also provide scripts for suggested conversations. For example, the website for Viagra, which treats erectile dysfunction, provides specific questions for patients to ask. The website for Addyi, often called the “female Viagra,” goes even further. Patients who answer a number of medical questions online are offered a 10- to 15-minute phone consultation about the drug for $49. Patients who don’t immediately book an appointment receive an email reminder a few minutes later. “This is more evidence,” Brownlee said, “that drug companies are not run by dummies.” Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law,8811,"Newly obtained White House records provide fresh details on how senior Obama administration officials used Mitt Romney’s landmark health-care law in Massachusetts as a model for the new federal law, including recruiting some of Romney’s own health care advisers and experts to help craft the act now derided by Republicans as “Obamacare.”  The records, gleaned from White House visitor logs reviewed by NBC News, show that senior White House officials had a dozen meetings in 2009 with three health-care advisers and experts who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006, when the Republican presidential candidate was governor of Massachusetts. One of those meetings, on July 20, 2009, was in the Oval Office and presided over by President Barack Obama, the records show.  “The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts,” said Jon Gruber, an MIT economist who advised the Romney administration on health care and who attended five meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. “They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model.” Romney has forcefully defended the Massachusetts law he signed, but says he is adamantly against a “one-size-fits-all national health-care system” imposed on all 50 states. “I will repeal Obamacare,” he has said. “And on day one of my administration, I will grant a waiver from Obamacare to all 50 states.” Asked about about the White House records Tuesday at a press conference announcing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's endorsement, Romney said the people involved in the White House meetings were ""consultants,"" not ""aides."" He added that ""one person (Obama) should have talked to was me."" The response echoed comments that Romney made last April after Obama suggested the White House had borrowed from his law in Massachusetts. “He does me the great favor of saying that I was the inspiration of his plan,” Romney said of Obama. “If that’s the case, why didn’t you call me? …Why didn’t you ask what was wrong? Why didn’t you ask if this was an experiment, what worked and what didn’t. … I would have told him, ‘What you’re doing, Mr. President, is going to bankrupt us.’” The White House visitor logs suggest that, if Obama officials didn’t talk directly with Romney, senior presidential aides did consult with others — like Gruber — who played important roles in helping to craft and implement the Massachusetts law. In addition to Obama himself, the meetings attended by Gruber were presided over by the president’s chief economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, then budget director Peter Orzag and Nancy-Ann DeParle, the president’s chief adviser on health care, the records show. Gruber was also given a $380,000 contract by the Obama administration in 2009 to work with Congress on drafting a new federal law based on the Massachusetts law, records show. Another Romney administration adviser consulted by the White House was Jon Kingsdale, a health-care expert who was appointed in 2006 by one of Romney’s Cabinet secretaries, Thomas Trimarco, to serve as executive director of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority — the state agency charged with implementing the new Massachusetts health-care law. Who met with whom
The White House records show Kingsdale attended three White House meetings on health care in 2009. Another expert who attended four White House meetings on health care was John McDonough, who also had played a leading role in shaping the law signed by Romney. As the head of a health-care advocacy group in Massachusetts, McDonough was named by Romney aides as a “stakeholder” to represent consumer interests on the health-care law. McDonough later shared an “innovator in health award” with Romney and 11 others — including several top lawmakers and business leaders — given by NEHI, a leading New England health-care research group, “for their collaborative efforts in achieving Massachusetts health reform.” The health-care reform law in Massachusetts was seen as a national breakthrough when Romney signed it an elaborate ceremony — complete with a fife and drum band — at Boston’s historic Faneuil Hall on April 12, 2006. It was attended by an array of prominent political figures in the state, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime champion of health-care reform. Kennedy warmly praised Romney at the event, saying, “You’ve led the way over the long and winding path to this moment.” Romney himself touted the historic significance of the act. “Massachusetts once again is taking a giant leap forward,” he said at the signing ceremony.  The key features of the new law were an individual mandate, which required state residents to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty — and the creation of a state agency to help the uninsured to purchase private health insurance plans at reasonable costs. It was touted by Romney at the event as a way of “expanding coverage to all our citizens.” Romney has since emphasized differences between his law in Massachusetts and ""Obamacare,"" saying the state law didn’t require any increase in taxes. But the extent to which Romney’s 2006 health-care law served as a blueprint for Obama’s health care plan has been a recurring issue in the GOP presidential contest. Obama aides have fueled the controversy. Romney “did some interesting things there on health care,” David Axelrod, the president’s political adviser, said in an interview earlier this year. “We got some good ideas from him.” On Monday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign unleashed a blistering attack ad — called “Romney’s Remedy” — that accused the former Massachusetts governor of running away from his record on health care. “Even the richest man can’t buy back his past,” reads a tag line on the ad. It cited a line that Romney had deleted this year from the paperback edition of his book, “No Apology: The CASE for American Greatness,” discussing the Massachusetts law which read: “We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country.” “When it comes to government-mandated health care, there is no difference between Mitt Romney and President Obama,” Perry spokesman, Mark Miner, said in a press release accompanying the ad. Romney’s aides shot back, accusing Perry of distorting his record on health care and taking quotes out of context. “Rick Perry is a desperate candidate who will say and do anything to prop up his sinking campaign,” said Gail Gitcho, Romney’s communications director. The role of Gruber could complicate the Romney campaign’s efforts to address the issue. An economist who specializes in health-care issues, he was hired by the Romney’s administration as a consultant and asked to run computer models on the costs of various approaches to extending health-care coverage. He told NBC News he attended one meeting with Romney in which the then governor forcefully insisted on including a controversial provision that some of his political advisers were wary about: the “individual mandate” that would require everybody in the state to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty. The same provision has since become the most contentious feature of Obama’s Affordable Care Act. “This was a big decision to be made and Governor Romney clearly stated that he believed without an individual mandate healthy people could just free ride on the system,” Gruber said of Romney’s decision. Connection played down
Romney aides have recently tried to suggest that Gruber was not a true adviser to Romney and did not play a big role in shaping the law. But Gruber was personally recognized by Romney for his role when he signed the health-care bill into law and was later appointed by Romney as a board member to the Connector Authority. (He also was given a photograph of the signing ceremony personally signed by Romney that read: “Jonathan, with deep appreciation and congratulations. A Triumph! Mitt Romney."")     Gruber now says he is “proud” of Romney for “sticking up for what he did in Massachusetts” but is “disappointed” about his current efforts to make distinctions between the state law and the Affordable Care Act. (He also noted that the Massachusetts law didn’t require any increase in taxes only because it received federal health-care funds that defrayed the costs of the new law.)   Romney is “the father of health-care reform,” said Gruber. “I think he is the single person most responsible for health care reform in the United States. … I’m not trying to make a political position or a political statement, I honestly feel that way. If Mitt Romney had not stood up for this reform in Massachusetts … I don’t think it would have happened nationally. So I think he really is the guy with whom it all starts.” ","Oct. 11, 2011"
Amy Coney Barrett’s past critiques on Obamacare face scrutiny,6329,"WASHINGTON — Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s newly announced Supreme Court nominee, whose appointment could cement a conservative court majority for a generation, is on record criticizing past judicial decisions upholding the Affordable Care Act. In a 2017 Notre Dame Law School article, Barrett quoted from Justice Antonin Scalia, who protested 2012 and 2015 rulings upholding core provisions of the law and lamented that Obamacare should be renamed “SCOTUScare.” Barrett’s scholarly writings are giving fuel to Democratic arguments that her appointment could upend health coverage for 20 million Americans. They provide her opponents with a paper trail of comments on the politically salient health care law that they lacked with Trump's prior court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. “For Justice Scalia and those who share his commitment to uphold text, the measure of a court is its fair-minded application of the rule of law, which means going where the law leads. By this measure, it is illegitimate for the Court to distort either the Constitution or a statute to achieve what it deems a preferable result,” Barrett wrote in the January 2017 article. Regarding a 2012 ruling upholding the law’s individual mandate by a 5-to-4 margin, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Barrett also criticized Chief Justice John Roberts, saying he had “pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.” Barrett would be Trump’s third appointment to the nation’s highest court, and with Republicans in control of the Senate, Democrats say they are clear-eyed about their limited procedural options for halting the appointment. If confirmed, Barrett could take her seat just before an election Trump is already saying he expects to be decided by the Supreme Court. With the nation experiencing a pandemic that’s already claimed 200,000 lives and left at least 6 million with potential Covid-19-related “pre-existing” conditions, Democrats are focusing on health care to persuade voters that Barrett’s appointment will have a direct impact on their lives. A new lawsuit led by Texas and supported by the Trump administration is coming before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10. ""The American people should make no mistake — a vote by any Senator for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, describing her as the potential ""deciding vote"" to invalidate the law. A Senate Republican aide familiar with the nomination process said it was a ""fool's errand to predict how judges will rule"" on particular cases, such as the ACA lawsuit, after they're confirmed. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated that Barrett is likely to address the issue during the process. Some legal scholars say Barrett’s past writings indicate sympathy for prior challenges to Obamacare but don’t reveal how she'd rule in the upcoming case, which hinges on a different legal question. Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law and an architect of the 2015 legal challenge to ACA subsidies, said Barrett’s passage evoking “SCOTUScare” was “a fairly straightforward description of the Scalia dissent.” “Given her embrace of textualism, it might be fair to suggest she found his opinion more convincing than the majority,” he said. “The second indicates some disapproval for the Chief Justice's NFIB opinion and its stretching of the text.” But Adler said that wouldn’t be inconsistent with believing the pending Texas case should fail. “Neither tells us much of anything about her views of the current ACA suit, however, as many of us who thought Roberts was wrong in NFIB, and that Scalia was correct in King, believe that Texas should lose the current case,"" he said in an email, referencing the 2015 case King v. Burwell. Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a critic of recent ACA litigation, said Barrett’s article suggests she would've sided with Scalia in the 2012 case, but said it “doesn't tell us anything about how she'd rule in a case that's significantly weaker.” Still, Bagley warned not to discount the legal danger Obamacare faces after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who voted in the majority in both cases involving the law. “I think ACA supporters should be concerned,” he said in an email. “Not panicked: The lawsuit is weak and the Supreme Court is unlikely to endorse it. But a small risk of a bad thing is worth worrying about.” Republicans have failed to undo the ACA legislatively, despite controlling Congress and White House for two years of Trump’s administration, and haven’t offered a replacement if the lawsuit succeeds. “Where is that Republican substitute bill?” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked in a Judiciary Committee hearing this week. Demand Justice, a progressive group that plans to spend as much as $10 million to build opposition to Barrett's nomination, released an ad Friday warning that if Barrett ""were on the Supreme Court, millions of Americans could lose their health insurance."" As a candidate, Trump criticized Roberts for voting to uphold the ACA, tweeting: “My judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush’s appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.” “We should be rightly concerned that he’s going to keep his word,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said during a Thursday hearing. On Saturday, after Trump officially announced Barrett as his pick, Democrats said her confirmation to the high court would cost millions of people their health care. ""Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act,"" Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted. ""Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that should Barrett be confirmed, ""millions of families’ health care will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that has infected seven million Americans and killed over 200,000 people in our country.""","Sept. 27, 2020"
"Top Democrats jump-start push to offer a health care 'public option,' a Biden promise",2658,"WASHINGTON — Two Democratic committee chairs overseeing health care policy are seeking to jump-start a legislative push to craft a ""public option"" to compete with private insurers. House Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote a letter to interested parties Wednesday seeking their input by July 31 on how to structure a government-provided plan. ""We believe bold steps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,"" they wrote. ""Health care affordability remains a challenge for many American families despite the fact that the United States spends more on health care than any other country."" Pallone and Murray touted the Affordable Care Act's successes at extending coverage but noted that ""tens of millions of Americans still remain uninsured or underinsured."" A ""public option"" was one of President Joe Biden's campaign promises, billed as a moderate alternative to rival Bernie Sanders' plan to scrap private coverage and put all Americans in Medicare. But Biden has not included the policy in his economic rescue and stimulus proposals so far, instead seeking to infuse cash in the ACA exchanges and invest in Covid-19 vaccines. But the Democrats are signaling it is still a priority, and aim to introduce a bill by the end of this year, a Murray aide said. It will be a daunting task for Democrats, who have paper-thin margins in Congress and not much hope of winning Republican support. They are likely to face an assault from health industry groups, including insurers who won't want to compete with the government, as well as doctors and hospitals who would complain about likely reductions in reimbursement rates. In their letter, Murray and Pallone requested information that would help them on the design and scope of the legislation, including whether the federal public option should be made available to all individuals or more targeted. And in a statement, they cited a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll that shows 68 percent of Americans favor a public option, ""where people can choose from a government-run health program or private insurance."" Recently, Democrats have offered competing bills for a public option, which was considered in the 2010 Affordable Care Act legislation and dropped after some party defections. Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced the Medicare-X Choice Act, which would set up a Medicare-style public option. And Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio., introduced the CHOICE Act to add a public option to the Affordable Care Act.","May 26, 2021"
"Trump signs EOs on health care, but does little to change existing legislation",3968,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced two new health care executive orders Thursday on protecting pre-existing conditions and preventing surprise billing as the president seeks to shore up his support on an issue that remains top of mind to voters amid to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The actions, however, have minimal impact. The surprise billing order requires Congress to pass legislation and pre-existing conditions are already protected under the Affordable Care Act, legislation that Trump is currently fighting to get rid of. ""My plan expands affordable insurance options, reduces the cost of prescription drugs, ends surprise medical billing, increases fairness through price transparency, streamlines bureaucracy, accelerates innovation, strongly protects Medicare, and always protects patients with pre-existing conditions,"" Trump claimed, speaking in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday afternoon. Trump has been promising a health care overhaul since his 2016 campaign for president. But nearly four years into his administration and as the country suffers from one of the worst health care crises in its history, Trump has struggled to land on a concrete alternative to the Affordable Care Act, which continues to grow in popularity. In June the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to repeal Obamacare, arguing that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law must be struck down with it. The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for Nov. 10, just a week after Election Day. ""I’m in court to terminate this really, really terrible situation. If we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with pre-existing conditions,"" Trump claimed Thursday. ""If we lose, what we have now is better than the original version of Obamacare by far, much better."" Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar defended the need for an executive order on pre-existing conditions to reporters on Thursday, pointing to the Supreme Court case. Azar said that the White House wanted to ensure that Americans will be protected even if the ACA is struck down by the Supreme Court. But the executive order appears to fall short of that goal. The order states that protecting pre-existing conditions was ""the policy of the United States"" but did not provide any legislative guarantees that Americans would not lose such protections if the ACA were nixed by the Supreme Court. ""The historic action I’m taking today includes the first-ever executive order to affirm it is the official policy of the United States government to protect patients with pre-existing conditions,"" Trump said. ""This is affirmed, signed, and done so we can put that to rest."" When pressed by reporters earlier Thursday on why Trump was signing an executive order directing Congress to pass legislation on surprise billing rather than signing an order to fix the problem right away, Azar said ""that is the plan the president plans to announce. It is what it is, as described."" Just minutes into his speech, which was billed as an official White House event, Trump criticized his opponents, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, as well as other Democrats for their “socialist” healthcare plans. Trump also spent much of his speech listing off steps he has taken as president to address health care access — ranging from telehealth to veteran choice. ""When you look at a list like that, the Democrats have never done anything like that,"" the president said. Trump campaigned in 2016 on repealing the ACA but fell just short in Congress in 2017. ""We’ve really become the health care party, the Republican Party,"" Trump said Thursday. Trump has recently used executive actions to address issues important to voters this election cycle, such as coronavirus economic relief. Similar to Thursday's orders, many of those actions have been largely symbolic and have not led to significant or meaningful policy change.","Sept. 25, 2020"

"6 Hot Healthcare Companies: From Smart Pill Bottles to Smart Diapers, What's Driving Innovation in Medical Tech?",9872,"Technology has revolutionized the way doctors treat, diagnose and perform surgeries. But experts say it has yet to improve the daily workflow of physicians – or the daily behavior of patients. It's time to check the vital signs of medical innovation. To say technology has profoundly impacted the world of surgery and clinical testing is an understatement. But experts say technology has yet to disrupt the way physicians communicate, read data and manage their workload. “Medicine is probably the last industry that benefits from computer assistance,” says Dr. Eyal Ephrat, founder of MedCPU. “Sure there’s imaging and MRIs, but when it comes to physicians’ decision-making alone, health care is completely not computerized.” Other panelists at a healthcare-focused  Northside Innovation Meetup  also noted that basic IT systems for doctors are severely antiquated.  Meanwhile, other innovators are already deploying technology to promote a healthier lifestyle. There’s the onrush of wearable fitness trackers, as well as an endless array of diet and fitness apps (i.e. Fitbit, Noom, MyFitnessPal, etc).  But what about helpful gadgets for patients at acute phases of medical care? Related: How Fitbit Is Cashing in on the High-Tech Fitness Trend We made the rounds and identified new platforms that are revolutionizing healthcare services. Also, from smart pill bottles to smart diapers, new home medical devices are detecting symptoms earlier, and monitoring conditions more frequently. Here's a look at the three tech platforms and three gadgets:   Dr. Eyal Ephrat discussing MedCPU at a Northside Innovation Meetup Image credit: Northside Festival 1) Eyal Ephrat, M.D.: Founder and CEO, MedCPU

Vital signs show: The MedCPU platform (which “reads” the doctor’s narrative notes on patients and transforms the scribble into discrete, structured data) is live at a dozen hospitals across the U.S. Dr. Ephrat is an obstetrician. But he also spent the past 20 years revolutionizing the way clinics capture and communicate patient information. He founded PeriGen (then E&C Medical Intelligence) in 1995 after learning that up to 40 percent of a hospital’s malpractice payouts occur in the obstetrics (OB) department. PeriGen is a bed-side fetal surveillance system that allows clinicians to better communicate information between OB clinics and hospital labor units. More recently, he founded MedCPU to address communication errors that occur across all practices, most notably in the emergency room. “About 60-70 percent of information resides in narrative dictations, summaries and notes,” says Dr. Ephrat. “That’s how physicians communicate.” He developed the MedCPU platform so that doctors could read all the messy free-text as structured entries. The system also detects in real-time if the doctor deviates from clinical guidelines or the patient’s recommended care history. “Think about an ER situation,” says Dr. Ephrat. “The doctor has zero time to learn everything about the patient, who may have dozens of medical records. So when the time comes for decision or diagnosis, that alert can guide them without disrupting the doctor’s traditional workflow.” Platforms like MedCPU can end the over-utilization of imaging. According to the JAMA Internal Medicine: people who suffer from headaches in the US result in nearly a $1 billion a year on brain scans — and the vast majority of them are probably unnecessary.   Josh Stein, Co-Founder &CEO, AdhereTech Image credit: AdhereTech 2) Josh Stein: Co-Founder and CEO, AdhereTech

During an annual innovation tournament, he pitched an idea: a prescription medicine bottle with integrated cell phone technology. He incepted the idea when his parents, both medical professionals, discussed a widespread lack of medical adherence (or, patients not taking their meds) as a $300 billion problem. According to Prescriptions for  Healthy America, it causes: After some industry analysis and studying the flaws of existing solutions, he realized that many products trying to solve medical adherence were complicated tools that required setup and behavioral changes. “There’s a disconnect because many ill patients don’t have this capacity,” says Stein. The patented bottle has built-in cell phone technology that sends data to AdhereTech. The company’s servers detect when the bottle was last opened and closed, and the amount of medicine remaining in it. If the patient forgets to take pills, the bottle lights up blue during the optimal dosage time. When that period passes, it begins to flash red and beep. Then the patient receives a text message or call as a final reminder.  Stein says his team is currently working with a design firm in New York City to decrease the cost of manufacturing the bottle.   3) Jennie Rubinshteyn and Yaroslav Faybishenko, Co-Founders, Pixie Scientific

Bradley says his parents – both doctors – would complain about the droning task of going through EMRs. “What impressed me was the massive amount of data generated in the healthcare system, but now it was time to capture the information and transform it into insights,” Bradley says. The data portal would be more unique than EHRs because it was designed to significantly lower healthcare costs. Also, its interface isn’t just for physicians to decode.

Hacking of Health Care Records Skyrockets,3002,"For John Kuhn, a simple X-ray after a snowboarding accident turned into an accounting nightmare when the hospital billed him $20,000 for a surgery he never had. ""So I had to go down in front of the billing department no less and pull up my shirt and show them that I did not have any major scarring on my stomach at all,"" Kuhn said. It turns out the hospital’s hard drive had been stolen along with Kuhn’s medical records. He’s not alone, experts say health care-record hacking is skyrocketing — up 11,000 percent last year alone. Roughly one out of every three Americans had their health care records compromised and most are completely unaware. Such hacks give criminals a wealth of personal information that, unlike a credit card number, can last forever.

White House: CBO ‘simply has it wrong’ on GOP healthcare bill,2308,"Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Monday dismissed the newly released Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House GOP healthcare bill, calling it ""just not believable."" Flanked by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Price told reporters outside the White House that “we disagree strenuously"" with the report and said the CBO considered only a “portion” of the Republican plan. Price and White House officials are promoting three “phases” of their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House bill represents phase one of the roll out, while other phases include regulatory reform and additional legislation that has yet to be introduced. “The fact of the matter is, we’re working on the regulations right now,” Price said. In ""scoring"" the House bill, the CBO estimated that 24 million more Americans would be without health insurance by 2026, including 14 million more lacking coverage by 2018. Price balked at those figures, saying it was ""virtually impossible to have that number occur."" “The fact of the matter is (Americans) are going to be able to have a coverage policy that they want for themselves and for their family,"" he added. ""They are going to have the kind of choices that they want. … So we think that CBO simply has it wrong.” As the officials spoke to reporters, the president tweeted against Obamacare. While Price tried to discredit aspects of the CBO report, Mulvaney pointed to the analysis as evidence that conservative ideals of market competition would bring healthcare premiums down. “The numbers that I’ve seen in the first glance is that CBO says the premiums will go down by at least 10 percent,” Mulvaney said. The report does estimate an eventual 10 percent decline in premiums, but the short term view shows premiums spiking 15 to 20 percent. Price would not go so far as to tell lawmakers to explicitly disregard the CBO. ""We will read the report, look into report beyond the top lines and we’ll have further comment tomorrow and talk with our colleagues about why we believe the entire plan that we have recommended moving forward and adopting is one that will provide greater opportunity for folks to purchase coverage they want,"" Price said.

"GOP draft health care bill cuts Medicaid, insurance subsidies",4392,"A draft bill detailing Republican plans to begin repealing and replacing many facets of the Affordable Care Act would provide expanded tax credits and health savings accounts for individuals while reducing federal spending on tax subsidies and Medicaid and practically eliminating both the current employer and individual mandate to provide and carry health insurance. The 105-page draft legislation, obtained by NBC News, repeals much of the current law, also known as Obamacare, within the next few years and sets in place a Republican vision of healthcare. The draft, dated February 10, is circulating among health care lobbyists and, while changes are possible, it is believed to be a legitimate effort at health care reform.

The legislation, which also cuts funding to Planned Parenthood, still has to be scored by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, for a full accounting of how much it would cost, but the largest funding mechanism is a tax on the most expensive employer-provided health insurance plans. What isn’t included is a guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions are able to obtain coverage. Members of the House, however, introduced a bill last week to preserve the pre-existing condition ban, signaling that it would have to be passed separately. The bill dismantles some major components of the ACA, including the expansion of Medicaid and the subsidies to purchase health insurance. In its place, Americans who need assistance to purchase health care will receive a tax credit – able to be received in advanced on a monthly basis - based on age. A person under 30 is eligible for a $2000 tax credit while a person over 60 is eligible for a $4000 credit. As for Medicaid, Republicans propose placing a cap on the number of Medicaid recipients in each state based on population, which would likely largely reduce the 72 million Americans currently receiving the benefit for low-income people. The current Medicaid expansion allows coverage for people based on income. The transition begins in 2020 and then instates a multi-year phase out - a timeline that might be problematic for some conservative members. They have also carved out exceptions for some medicaid recipients with pre-existing conditions to ensure they keep their medicaid coverage, including cervical and breast cancer or are blind, which are specifically noted. The measure also also creates state-based high risk pools for people who don't have access to insurance. The federal government would start in 2018 providing $15 billion to help fund the high risk pools, but the number decreases to $10 billion by 2020 and beyond. And the legislation would greatly expand the use of Health Savings Accounts, a tax deductible way to purchase health insurance, which has become a top Republican priority. The measure does not directly get rid of the individual and employer mandate to purchase and provide health care, but it zeroes out the penalty, making violation of the mandate non-enforceable. Republicans, struggling to figure out a way to pay for their health insurance plan, puts in place a tax on the most expensive employer-based health insurance plans, which is an expanded version of the so-called Cadillac tax to the most expensive employer based plans. ""We’re cointinuing to work toward a defecit neutral replacement plan along with repeal and I’m confident we’ll deliver on that,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said. The measure repeals unpopular taxes opposed by the business community and health field, including the medical device tax and the tax on health insurance, also known as the HIT tax, that helped to pay for the ACA. The plan is already being panned by some. Ron Pollack, head of the Families USA, which advocates for health consumers, said the draft “buys less care — or no coverage at all.” “This leaked Republican proposal, if enacted, would put us on a destructive path that would decimate the safety-net Medicaid program for over 72 million people; drastically reduce premium subsidies for working families; and cause out-of-pocket health costs to soar,” Pollack said. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that the House is working to bring a bill to the House floor for a vote the first week of March. Members return from a one-week recess Monday.","Feb. 25, 2017"
GAO Report: HealthCare.gov Still Has Security Flaws,977,"HealthCare.gov, the online portal to the federal health insurance exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act, is still vulnerable to security and privacy threats, according to a new report from the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO). While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has ""taken steps"" to fix flaws found during HealthCare.gov's rocky rollout last year, it has not ""fully addressed security and privacy management weaknesses"" that have placed data ""at risk."" This report comes less than a month after it was reported that malware had been uploaded onto a HealthCare.gov server. No data was stolen during that incident. ""Until these weaknesses are addressed, increased and unnecessary risks remain of unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of the information collected and maintained by Healthcare.gov,"" the report said.

Coronavirus is killing more healthcare workers in Mexico. Here's why.,5518,"MEXICO CITY - When the coronavirus epidemic began to intensify in Mexico at the end of March, Doctor Jose Garcia said his bosses at a public trauma hospital in Mexico City denied his request for masks, gloves and disinfectant. They argued such protective equipment was only necessary for those working directly with coronavirus patients, Garcia said. Unconvinced, he bought it himself. The hospital’s director disputes this, saying all staff received protective equipment. Either way, Garcia had already contracted the virus and infected his wife and one-year-old daughter. Garcia is one of over 70,000 medical workers to catch the coronavirus in Mexico, where the pandemic death toll is now the third-highest worldwide, behind the United States and Brazil. Government data indicates that healthcare workers’ risk of dying is four times higher than in the United States, and eight times higher than in Brazil. “The coronavirus has hit health workers all over the world, but it’s been especially bad in Mexico,” said Alejandro Macias, an epidemiologist who spearheaded Mexico’s response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Staff have had to buy their own equipment, often in informal marketplaces and of substandard quality, Macias said. The government has said there were shortcomings in equipment provision early on but says it has worked hard to protect workers and flown in vital equipment from China and the United States. It also accuses past administrations of letting the health service deteriorate. Mexico’s deputy health minister and coronavirus czar, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said in July that many of the nurses and doctors who died of the virus had pre-existing medical conditions, and that some did not use protective gear in “optimal fashion.” In Mexico, 19 percent of confirmed infections are of medical staff, almost three times the global average, according to figures from the International Council of Nurses and the Mexican National Association of Doctors and Nurses. The plight of health workers is complicating efforts to contain the outbreak, which has killed close to 50,000 people in Mexico, battered the economy and cost millions of jobs. Garcia, 48, said in an interview that he believes he was one of about a dozen medical staff indirectly infected by a patient who arrived at the Lomas Verdes hospital with coronavirus symptoms and later died. “They’ve been very irresponsible with us,” he said, referring to his employer and its alleged failure to provide protective equipment. The hospital’s director, Gilberto Meza, said that 213 Lomas Verdes staff had contracted the virus. Citing an epidemiological study he said the hospital had conducted, he said that all were infected outside the facility. He said all staff had received goggles, face shields and masks. He declined to say when they were provided. Garcia and his family survived and he is now back at work. But the two weeks they had coronavirus symptoms were, he said, “hell”: headaches, fever, diarrhea and shortness of breath. As of July 24, 72,980 Mexican medical staff had caught the coronavirus, and 978 died, government figures show. In the United States, which has a population 2.5 times that of Mexico, 123,738 medical personnel have tested positive for coronavirus and 598 have died, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures. The health ministry of Brazil, which is about two-thirds more populous than Mexico, had reported 189 deaths of medical practitioners by end-July. Some private data in Brazil give higher figures, but still well below Mexico. Over a dozen nurses and doctors interviewed by Reuters said they got the virus in part because they did not receive timely information or protective equipment. Many have protested about having to reuse disposable gear and launched petitions for better kit. In one public hospital in northern Mexico, medical workers told Reuters in April their managers told them not to wear protective masks to avoid unsettling patients. Zoe Robledo, head of Mexico’s main public health service, IMSS, said in April that it had suffered equipment shortages, as well as “delays, oversights, and errors that needed correcting.” Mexico’s spending on health as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the lowest in the 37-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A recent study by the OECD put Mexico’s health spending at 5.5% of GDP, compared to 9.1% in Chile and 7.3% in Colombia in 2019. In Brazil it was 9.4%, though the latest data available were from 2017. Nurses often work in multiple hospitals to supplement wages of about 8,500 pesos ($377) per month, according to Mexico City’s government. Movement between hospitals heightens the contagion risk, said Oliva Lopez, the city’s health minister. “Our health personnel combine multiple jobs and are exposed in multiple spaces,” Lopez told Reuters, saying her ministry had gone to great lengths to get staff protective equipment, and blaming previous governments for “pauperizing” the profession. More than 600 nurses had died by the end of June in some 30 countries surveyed by the Geneva-based International Council of Nurses. Mexico accounted for 160 of the deaths, or over a quarter. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one nurse at a Mexico City public hospital said she felt “abandoned” by authorities. “But we can’t say: ‘Now I can’t work, or don’t want to’,” she said. “This is what we trained for.” Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.","Aug. 6, 2020"
"Senate Democrats reveal $3.5 trillion plan to invest in health care, climate change and more",3035,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democratic leaders announced an agreement Tuesday evening to advance a $3.5 trillion spending plan to finance a major expansion of the economic safety net. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the $3.5 trillion would be in addition to the $579 billion in new spending in the bipartisan infrastructure agreement. He said the deal would include a ""robust expansion of Medicare"" that would include new benefits like dental, vision and hearing coverage, along with major funding for clean energy. ""If we pass this, this is the most profound change to help American families in generations,"" he said. ""Joe Biden is coming to our lunch tomorrow to lead us on to getting this wonderful plan that affects American families in a so profound way, more than anything that's happened to generations,"" Schumer told reporters. ""We are very proud of this plan. We know we have a long road to go. We're going to get this done for the sake of making average Americans' lives a whole lot better."" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a member of the Budget and Finance committees, said the plan would be ""fully paid for."" The agreement would prohibit tax increases on small businesses and people making under $400,000, a Democratic aide familiar with the deal said. The announcement points to a challenge for Democrats, who will have to agree on a massive bill that is financed with new tax revenue to pass it through razor-thin congressional majorities, with no realistic hope of winning Republican support. Democrats have no margin for error in the 50-50 Senate, and they can lose just four votes in the House before the legislation would be in danger of failing. ""This is, in our view, a pivotal moment in American history,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the Budget Committee chairman, told reporters. ""What this legislation says among many, many other things is that those days are gone. The wealthy and large corporations are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, so that we can protect the working families in this country,"" he said. The agreement, a significant decrease from Sanders' $6 trillion proposal, is an attempt to achieve consensus in an ideologically diverse Democratic Party with a host of competing interests. The legislation has yet to be written. Senate Democratic leaders hope to advance both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the party-line budget reconciliation bill this month, before Congress leaves for the August recess. As Senate Democrats were literally down the hall agreeing on their plan, a separate bipartisan group of 22 senators were meeting in another room working to hash out the last remaining issues on their own $579 billion plan. ""There's a goal to have all the member-level decisions made by the time we end the session on Thursday,"" Sen Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said after the meeting. That group hopes to get investment and funding questions resolved by the end of the week so that the bill text can be finalized, and the Congressional Budget Office can do its cost analysis.","July 14, 2021"

"1 in 3 Americans worry about being able to afford health care, NBC News/Commonwealth Fund survey says",3973,"Nearly one third of American voters fear they won’t be able to pay for health care in the coming year, according to an NBC News/Commonwealth Fund survey released Thursday. The survey found that 31 percent of respondents were worried about being able to afford their health insurance in the next 12 months, 29 percent feared they wouldn’t have enough money to pay for out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, and 32 percent worried about being able to afford other out-of-pocket costs. Nearly 80 percent of likely voters said they thought reducing health care costs should be a high priority for the next president. The poll was conducted between Jan. 28 and Feb. 16 and included a nationally representative sample of 2,303 adults. The focus of the analysis included 1,594 likely voters. “The poll results underscore the overall concern people have about affording health care,” said Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund. In fact, the findings may be an underestimate of the level of concern among Americans, because people were asked specifically about the next 12 months rather than overall worry, she said. One in 5 likely voters said they had problems paying or were unable to pay their medical bills over the last two years. Among them, to pay their medical bills: “This shows that incomes haven’t really kept pace with health insurance costs,” Collins said. “When middle income people are stuck with large bills, they are resorting to extreme measures to cover those bills.” Another worrisome issue, Collins said, is that more than 1 in five (22 percent) people said they or a family member had a health problem worsen in the past 12 months because they had delayed getting health care or medications due to the cost. That’s what happened to Lisa Wilson, 55, of Iowa. When she lost her job in 2015, she lost her health insurance, which meant she also missed her annual mammogram because she couldn’t afford to pay for it. Even though she found another job eight months later, the lost time cost her dearly: Her next mammogram turned up an advanced cancer. “It was shocking,” Wilson told NBC News. “They told me it was pretty aggressive and I needed to seek care.” Wilson is currently battling that stage 4 cancer, which has spread to her bones and her liver. And her insurance woes haven’t ended. Her current insurance company has denied claims for the PET scans Wilson needs to monitor the effectiveness of her treatments — after initially saying it would pay. In the hole for $15,000, she had to dip into her 401K to pay her medical bills. “It’s bad enough to have to fight cancer and then to have to turn around and fight the insurance company as well, that takes a lot of time and effort that could be spent focusing on the care,” she said. The survey also found that many people were worried about the unpredictability of what may or may not be covered by their insurance. More than a quarter (28 percent) of likely voters worry they will receive an unexpected or surprise medical bill over the next year. While a majority of likely voters think the next president should make reducing health care costs a top priority, there was disagreement, along party lines, as to who would do this best. More than half of likely voters (54 percent) said they were very or somewhat confident that a Democratic president would work to make health care more affordable, as compared to the 42 percent who said they were very or somewhat confident that President Donald Trump, if re-elected, would make health care more affordable. Among Democrats, 85 percent had confidence that a Democratic president would make health care more affordable; similarly, 85 percent of Republicans had confidence that Trump could do the same. The NBC News/Commonwealth Fund poll was conducted Jan. 28 - Feb. 16 on 2,303 U.S. adults and its overall margin of error is plus-minus 2.4 percentage points.

Chatbots are shaking up the workforce in some unexpected ways,6303,"Robots have already replaced humans in many jobs, from manufacturing cars to filling warehouse orders and flipping burgers. But as artificial intelligence programs learn to better communicate with humans, they’ll soon encroach on careers once considered untouchable, like law and accounting. These chatbots may one day even replace your doctor. This January, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service launched a trial with Babylon Health, a startup developing an AI chatbot. For six months, Babylon will offer a triage service on its app as an alternative to dialing the U.K.'s 24 hour non-emergency telephone number. Related: Meet Baxter, the Friendly Robot You Control With Your Mind The bot’s goal is the same as the helpline, only without humans: to avoid unnecessary doctor appointments and help patients with over-the-counter remedies. Using the system, patients chat with the bot about their symptoms, and the app determines whether they should see a doctor, go to a pharmacy, or stay home. It’s now available to about 1.2 million Londoners. But the upcoming version of Babylon's chatbot can do even more: In tests, it's now dianosing patients faster human doctors can, says Dr. Ali Parsa, the company’s CEO. The technology can accurately diagnose about 80 percent of illnesses commonly seen by primary care doctors. To find a diagnosis, the bot chats with a patient about his or her history and symptoms, creates a probabilistic model, and then asks more specific questions to whittle down the likely culprits — much the same way a doctor would. The result is a diagnosis in consultation with a medical professional — at least for now. There will be some regulatory and legal issues to overcome before the AI can work independently of its human counterparts. The AI backbone of Babylon Health's chatbot is based on about 300 million strings of information — including established medical facts to aid in diagnosis, and regular updates, like input from all 11,000 journal articles on dermatology published last year. It’s the largest collection of knowledge in primary care medicine, Parsa says. The bot then uses machine learning to improve its diagnoses based on outcomes. The reason these chatbots are increasingly important is cost: two-thirds of money moving through the U.K.’s health system goes to salaries. “Human beings are very expensive,” Parsa says. “If we want to make healthcare affordable and accessible for everyone, we’ll need to attack the root causes.” Humans will always have a role in caring for patients, Parsa says, because they’re much better at cognition and empathy. “A machine can’t put hand on you and say, 'Look I’m going to take care of you.'” Related: Crowdsourcing is Changing the Diagnosis of Rare Diseases But machines can assess the probability a patient will do well on certain medications, and examine relevant data sets to extract information. “No doctor loves doing diagnosis; doctors like taking care of people,” Parsa says. “So let’s allow machines to look into the data and tell you probabilities.” Globally, there are 5 million fewer doctors today than needed, so anything that lets a doctor do their jobs faster and more easily will be welcome, Parsa says. Half the world’s population has little access to health care — but they have smartphones. Chatbots could get them the help they need. It might sound like AI puts all human jobs on the chopping block, but the story of technology is one of augmentation, not replacement, says Ross Goodwin, a data scientist who specializes in AI. “Most skepticism comes from the fact that we’ve read a lot of fiction about robots,” he says. “AI taking everyone’s jobs makes a good story; but less of a good story is AI helping people in mundane, simple ways.” Related: The Quest to Create Artificial Blood May Soon Be Over Even just asking how someone is doing today. That’s what a Facebook Messenger bot named Joy does to help track people's mental health. The bot’s creators say they want Joy to seem like a friend instead of a chart — even though Joy can offer weekly summaries. The aim is for these bots to be a gateway, encouraging a conversation that eventually culminates with users seeking qualified help if needed. “I don’t think there’s any places that AI can’t contribute,” Goodwin says. AI chatbots aren't all about life and death. When Joshua Browder started driving in 2015, he contested so many parking tickets that he was inspired to create DoNotPay — a chatbot that uses AI and algorithms to help people fight the system. The app asks a series of questions about the violation, from why you believe you shouldn’t have been ticketed to specific details about the offense, then uses the responses to produce a 500-word letter with exact legal language to contest the ticket. DoNotPay’s success rate is about 60 percent, Browder says. Just a year into the project, Browder’s app has helped drivers in London, New York, and Seattle overturn 200,000 parking tickets totaling more than $6 million in fines. The system is expanding this year to cities including San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. That’s just the beginning. Browder, now a student at Stanford University, has also created a project to assist refugees as they complete immigration applications for the United States and Canada. Through a conversation on Facebook Messenger, the chatbot first determines if a person is eligible for asylum, then takes down relevant details and fills out his or her forms — many of which are written in complex language. Related: Can Science Meet Demand of Coming Organ Shortage? “There are so many lawyers charging hundreds of dollars for filing a few documents,” Browder says. “People are terrible at describing their issues; chatbots are really good at translating human input into legalese.” Browder sees bots soon moving into other areas of law. “Anything you see on late night TV advertising will be fair game: pensions and benefits, workplace harassment, injuries, and so on.” And more industries may soon be disrupted by the always-available, low-cost bots. Startups have created systems that can tutor students for big exams or track your business expenses. “There is so much potential for chatbots to help people,” Browder says.

Five easy ways to cut your healthcare costs,3968,"Here’s a quick, two-question quiz: According to the 2016 Healthcare Consumerism Index from Alegeus, a health benefits service provider, for two-thirds of consumers the answers are: I don't know. And no. That’s a problem. Healthcare costs run over $3 trillion a year — and have been increasing at well above the inflation rate — with more of that money coming out of a consumer's budget. So what can you do to bring those costs down? Take these five steps: The number one way consumers can save on healthcare expenses is to contribute pre-tax dollars to a FSA/Flexible Spending Account or HSA/Health Savings Accounts, says Alegeus CEO Steve Auerbach. Because these dollars go in tax-free (and aren’t taxed when they’re used to pay for medical expenses), they stretch an average of 30% further. FSA and HSA funds can be used for most prescriptions, medical bills and even certain over-the-counter medicines with a prescription from a physician. Note: There is a big difference between the two accounts. If you don’t use the money you put into your FSA each year by your company’s deadline, you lose that money. The money in your HSA is yours to keep and you can take it with you from job to job, even into retirement. You need a high deductible health plan to qualify to open an HSA (Bronze and Silver plans on the exchanges qualify.) A Consumer Reports poll showed that only 17 percent of people do this. And having a standard co-pay doesn’t let you off the hook because sometimes you can get prescriptions for even less than that. If you’re paying out of pocket, the prices can vary widely. GoodRx.com can tell you what a fair price is for particular drugs. The differences can be striking: Consumer Reports found differences on generic Plavix (within the same Dallas zip code) from $150 to $23, and on Cymbalta (within the same Raleigh NC zip) from $249 to $43. Since 2015, there has been a 20 percent increase in consumers who research and compare alternatives before a major service or procedure, according to the Alegeus study. That’s good news, because there are wide cost disparities in healthcare procedures. Healthcare BlueBook reports differences of up to 500 percent, even in the same provider network. You can and should negotiate with your doctors on your own. (They’re used to it.) But if you’re dealing with pre-existing bills, try tapping into Copatient.com. This service, which helps consumers negotiate savings on large medical bills, found that 90 percent of consumer bills have savings opportunities, either through error correction or negotiation. You upload your bills, they analyze them and give you an estimate of how much can be saved. You can take it yourself from there, or you can have them do it for you for a charge of 35 percent of the money saved. There are apps and other discount cards that can help you get a lower price if you’re paying out of pocket for your prescriptions. Among them: ScriptRelief which has an app called SearchRx, Blink Health and GoodRx. They’ve negotiated lower prices (because they buy volumes) for drugs. Also talk to your doctor about whether an alternative medication is just as good and, perhaps cheaper. Ask for help if you can’t afford your meds. The Partnership For Prescription Assistance — online at PPARX.com — is a free service that can help you access your drugs. You tell them what medicines you take, whether (or not) you have any drug coverage, and they help you find prescription assistance programs that can help. Shop Costco and online pharmacies for drugs. They’re known for low drug prices. Just be sure if you use an online pharmacy it’s US-based and a Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site (it will display that seal on the website). And no matter where you’re shopping, try to buy 90 days worth, not 30. Many generics are priced at $4 per prescription every 30 days, but $10 for 90 days. It’s a small saving, but if you’re buying multiple prescriptions it adds up. With Kelly Hultgren","Sept. 2, 2016"
LifePoint to buy Province Healthcare,1861,"LifePoint Hospitals Inc., a operator of acute care facilities in rural areas, said Monday that it agreed to acquire Province Healthcare Co. for about $1.125 billion in cash and stock in a transaction expected to close in the first half of 2005. Shares of LifePoint fell sharply on the news, dropping nearly 10 percent, or $3.11, to $29.63 in pre-market activity on the Nasdaq National Market. Under the agreement, Province stockholders will receive $11.375 in cash and between 0.2917 and 0.3447 LifePoint shares for each Province share held, depending on Lifepoint's stock price. Province stockholders will own about 30 percent of the merged company. Based on LifePoint's stock price of $32.74 and Province's price of $13.61 at the close of trading Friday, LifePoint said it would pay about $565.4 million in cash and issue 17.1 million shares, giving Province shares a 66 percent premium at $22.66 per share. Including assumed debt, the deal is worth a total of $1.7 billion, LifePoint said. LifePoint said the merger would create a health-care company managing 50 hospitals with combined revenues of $1.7 billion in 2003, and expects the acquisition to increase 2005 earnings by 3.5 percent.

GOP Rep. introduces 'World's Greatest Healthcare Plan',1252,"Whether you call it “Trumpcare,” “Ryancare,” or “Obamacare Lite,” there is one name that stands above all the rest when it comes to alternatives to the Affordable Care Act: “World's Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017.” It’s not the name of the Obamacare alternative now being hotly debated in Congress (that’s the The American Health Care Act), rather it is a different Republican healthcare reform bill introduced by GOP Rep. Pete Sessions last week. It is the second time the Texas Republican, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., has put forth legislation with that boastful title. The first came last May as Donald Trump, known for making definitive claims of greatness, neared clinching the Republican presidential nomination. And though the 2016 version did not get much traction, Sessions reintroduced the bill this year as the healthcare debate took center stage in Congress. The “World's Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017” would eliminate individual and employer health coverage mandates from Obamacare, but would not fully repeal the former president signature law. A spokesman for Sessions’ told USA Today the bill is not meant to compete with the one introduced by Congressional leadership earlier this week, and that he supports the GOP plan.","March 9, 2017"
Do doctors treat women differently?,4213,"From the way medicines are researched and tested, to the approach doctors take diagnosing and treating diseases, more and more research shows a bias against women in the health care system. It could jeopardize their health, but now there's a push for change. “This is the ‘MeToo’ of health care,” Dr. Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbara Streisand Women's Heart Center at Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai, told NBC News special anchor Maria Shriver. In a recent report, Bairey Merz found that though heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women and they are nearly twice as likely as men to die in the year following a heart attack, only 40 percent of women’s routine care includes a heart risk check. Too often, doctors treat women at risk for heart disease very differently than men, Bairey Merz noted. “Young women were more likely to be told to lose weight, where the young men who were actually more overweight were more likely to be put on effective preventive therapy,” she said. “People are always sort of judging women according to their weight."" And there's more: Though women are twice as likely to suffer from chronic pain as men, studies show women's reports of pain are more likely to be dismissed. Laurie Edwards, an associate professor of English at Northeastern University, knows what that’s like. All her life, she has struggled to breathe. She suffers from a chronic but rare lung disease that was never properly diagnosed as she was growing up, with doctor after doctor telling her that her symptoms were all in her head — something many female patients endure. “It's very easy to say, ‘Oh, you're just stressed out. You're just another anxious, young, type-A female student, take a deep breath. Maybe you need antidepressants. Maybe you need anxiety medicine,’” Edwards noted. She's written two books about her experience: ""In The Kingdom of The Sick: A Social History of Chronic Illness in America"" and ""Life Disrupted: Getting Real About Chronic Illness in Your Twenties and Thirties."" It wasn't until she was in her 20s — and in the hospital with lung problems — that her disease was correctly diagnosed. “I'm in a great place, but how much better would my long-term prognosis be if I had been doing all these things all the time?”Edwards said. Gender biases exist in medical research, too. While clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health are now required to include female subjects, those funded by private medical companies are exempt. And in lab studies, mostly male animals have been used, meaning many drugs are never evaluated for women at all before coming to market. Perhaps it's not surprising women are up to 75 percent more likely to have an adverse drug reaction than men. “There are actually really important differences between men and women that go all the way down to the level of our cells,” said Dr. Janine Austin Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women’s Health at the National Institutes of Health. “Every single cell in our body has a sex, either XX or XY, female or male, that actually translates to different chemical reactions, and that can have important and in fact dramatic effects on how we respond to a treatment.” There is some progress being made in addressing these issues. NIH is doing educational outreach to physicians and pharmacists about gender biases, and many medical journals now require researchers to include females in their studies. While patients may think female doctors are more sensitive to this issue, studies show they have just as much bias as male doctors, so no matter who you see, it's important to ask the right questions. Experts advised these tips: • When prescribed medication, ask your doctors if the drug was ever studied in women and whether it has potential side effects for women. If they don't know, go somewhere else. • If you're told to get a medical test, ask how accurate it is for women. Many common diagnostic tools were designed only around men. • When it comes to assessing your body and health, listen to your gut. “My message to women is to be willing to look for a second or a third opinion, and to be willing to walk away from a partnership that isn't working,” Edwards said.","July 18, 2018"
"Opinion: With imminent healthcare changes, who will get left behind?",4950,"When I was growing up, my immigrant parents worked in a Chinese take-out restaurant. After working 12-hour physically demanding shifts, they would return home at 2 o’clock in the morning. When we got sick, my sister and I would have to wake up our sleep-deprived mother to drive us the 15 miles to the Chinese community health center, where we would sit for hours until someone was available to see us. My parents’ limited income, nonexistent employer sponsored health insurance, and their poor English skills made going to a “normal” doctor’s office impossible. My experience is not unique among the millions of Americans who struggle to cover their basic health needs. However, while the working poor — and particularly immigrant populations — still face significant barriers to accessing adequate healthcare, the reforms provided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have greatly increased the number of people who are insured. The ACA includes a number of highly regarded provisions that have helped to expand coverage: eliminating the bar on coverage due to preexisting conditions, expanding Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, establishing new insurance Marketplace exchanges, and providing coverage for adult children up to age 26. But healthcare advocates fear that President-elect Trump and the Republican Congress will repeal the ACA and dismantle a system currently providing millions of people with affordable healthcare coverage. The nominations of Seema Verma as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Tom Price — author of the GOP’s proposed replacement for Obamacare— as Health and Human Services Secretary seem to confirm those fears. RELATED: How Trump's First 100 Days in the White House Could Affect Asian Americans An estimated 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage since the passage of the ACA in 2010. This statistic is particularly significant because large gains were within communities of color, with the uninsured dropping from 22.4 percent to 10.6 percent among Black non-Hispanics, 41.8 percent to 30.5 percent among Hispanics, and 14.3 percent to 7 percent among White non-Hispanics. However, with the imminent change in the healthcare system, millions of individuals will lose their health coverage, and the neediest populations — minority and limited English proficient (LEP) communities — will once again be left behind. The “model minority myth” often makes invisible the Asian-American community’s need for social services, public benefits, and health coverage. Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing populations in poverty since the Great Recession. For example, in New York City, Asian Americans had the highest poverty rate, 26.4 percent, of all racial groups between 2009-2014. In 2000 and 2006, Asian Americans in New York City also had the highest percentage, 21.3 percent and 22 percent respectively, of “near poor” people (those who are above 100 percent federal poverty rate (FPL) but below 200 percent FPL). These “near poor” individuals earn too much money to receive traditional Medicaid, but could be covered by the Medicaid expansion or purchase affordable healthcare coverage in the marketplace under the ACA. The ACA has served as the safety net coverage for the tens of thousands of Asian Americans who work in small businesses, are self-employed, or are elderly and cannot afford to pay for their own health costs. Some of the ACA’s key provisions that provide coverage for preventative care, reproductive health, and Medicaid expansion, have the biggest impact on the low-income people and the historically underrepresented groups, like Asian Americans. RELATED: Opinion: Asian American, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders Need to Mobilize for Disaggregated Data Many families, much like mine when I was growing up, do not have access to employer health insurance and are unable to get Medicaid coverage. Even after my parents bought their own restaurant, they were still unable to afford insurance for themselves and their employees. For families who work in or own small businesses, the ACA is the only means by which they can purchase medical insurance coverage. Until the new administration can design a program that can ensure comprehensive quality coverage for all who need it, the burden is on individuals, community groups, and leaders to come together and advocate for protecting the Affordable Care Act. An ACA repeal and weakening of entitlement programs like Medicaid would have catastrophic outcomes for those who desperately need healthcare coverage.

Nurses in multiple states will protest over a 'lack of preparedness',3333,"Nurses at hospitals in multiple states are protesting what they describe as one of the nation's largest hospital chains' ""lack of preparedness"" amid the coronavirus pandemic. The National Nurses Union, which represents 10,000 registered nurses at 19 hospitals managed by HCA Healthcare in California, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada and Texas, is demanding that the hospital chain provide optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) for nurses and other staff. HCA Healthcare spokesman Harlow Sumerford the company is doing everything it can to equip patient care teams to provide safe, effective care to the people they serve. ""The National Nurses Union is trying to use this crisis to advance its own interest — organizing more members,"" Sumerford said in a statement to NBC News. ""The pandemic has strained the worldwide supply of personal protective equipment, including masks, face shields and gowns, a challenge that is not unique to HCA Healthcare or any other health system in the United States,"" Sumerford said, in part. ""While we are doing everything in our power to secure additional supplies, and we are following CDC protocols for using and conserving PPE, the worldwide shortage is a reality that we are addressing with realistic, workable solutions."" Nurses at HCA’s Mission Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, will deliver a petition to hospital managers on Thursday with their concerns about hospital preparedness in the battle against COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Some nurses at HCA hospitals have reported that they have had to work without proper protective equipment and are told to unsafely reuse masks. Nurses at Central Florida Regional Hospital in Sanford, Florida, said they were told they could not wear masks while working because it ""scared the patients,"" according to Jean Ross, a registered nurse and president of National Nurses United. HCA Healthcare's spokesman did not address specific allegations raised by the National Nurses Union in the company's statement Thursday. NBC News reached out to Central Florida Regional Hospital for comment about this allegation but did not immediately hear back. ""Protecting our patients is our highest priority, but it becomes much harder when we don't have the safe protections which puts us in danger of becoming infected,"" Angela Davis, a registered nurse who works in a unit dedicated to treating coronavirus patients at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a statement.

"Deep in the troubled heart of Texas, health care suffers",6227,"AUSTIN, Texas — The booming $1.8 trillion Texas economy rivals that of many countries and puts the state at the top of a host of rankings for its fast-growing cities, low unemployment and job growth. But the familiar Texas braggadocio disappears when it comes to health care. Texas has both the largest number (4.7 million) and highest percentage (19 percent) of uninsured residents under age 65 in the country, according to a new Urban Institute analysis. Two-thirds of the uninsured are in families with at least one full- or part-time worker. The state ranks 37th in the 2018 issue of America’s Health Rankings, an annual state-by-state assessment of the nation’s health. Thirty-three percent of adult Texans are obese. The state’s maternal mortality rate is 34.2 per 100,000 live births, a rate that has increased 9 percent since 2016 and is one of the worst in the country. It ranks 47th in the number of primary care doctors per capita. The state’s “Don’t Mess With Texas” mantra drives much of its politics and policies, as limited government, low taxes and individual rights have prevailed at the statehouse for almost a quarter-century. That freewheeling formula has worked gangbusters for the economy, including the business of medicine, giving rise to some of the nation’s wealthiest hospital systems, as well as hundreds of freestanding emergency rooms and surgery centers. But it has also left citizens struggling to get care and pay bills in health care’s wild west. It has allowed and supported entrepreneurial health care practices that are illegal in many states, including freestanding emergency rooms, doctor-owned hospitals and balance billing. Texas has more uninsured residents than any other state, in part because its largely Republican state politicians elected not to expand Medicaid. “We’re not having honest discussions about medical needs,” said Sen. Kirk Watson, a Democrat, a cancer survivor and former Austin mayor. Instead, the discussions focus on health care costs, he added. In August, Ken Blankenship, 48, of McKinney, Texas, was suffering from intense headaches, muscle pain and weakness. “I was hanging outside all day. It was hot,” he said, adding that he played basketball and threw around a baseball in the park. His wife forced him to go to an urgent care clinic, which diagnosed him as dehydrated, then referred him to a freestanding emergency room to rule out a stroke. Though the facility was in his insurance plan, his copayment was over $2,300 for fluids and a CAT scan. “I was shocked. The first thing I thought was, ‘That’s crazy. It must be a mistake,’” Blankenship said. He got the bill reduced by more than $600 after calling the ER. “All I know is they have me wanting to be thankful for paying $1,600,” he said. In many cases, there has been “somewhat more of a free rein,” with corporate entities now involved in the practice of medicine, said economist David Warner, professor emeritus of health and social policy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2009, Texas was the first state to allow ERs that were independent of hospitals, prompting a rush of highly profitable ERs. At last count, 214 freestanding ERs have popped up across the state, in addition to hundreds of urgent-care clinics and surgery centers. “Basically, they can charge what they like,” Warner said. “They can have a charge scheme that has no relation to cost"" of care, he said. He adds that the freestanding ERs often mislead patients, telling them that their insurance will pay for everything and then going after them for unpaid balances. For the most part, the Texas Medical Association — the country’s largest state medical group — has championed doctors’ business interests and also lobbied against giving nurse practitioners more leeway to practice independently, as they do in neighboring states. When the Texas Legislature convenes next month, the group will focus on “broken issues,” including freestanding ERs, Medicaid and overall access to care, said Dr. Douglas Curran, group president and a family physician in East Texas. Without policy changes, Texas’ working poor and uninsured will continue to find it almost impossible to get high-quality care. The state’s failure to expand Medicaid — even in the midst of a robust economy — keeps millions of people in the Lone Star State living without insurance, straining the medical system, driving up costs and compromising public health. “We can be a state that’s wildly economically successful and still have more than one-quarter of our working-age adults uninsured,” said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy institute in Austin. Health care experts maintain that the political leadership has no interest in reducing the number of uninsured. The chairman and vice chairman of the Texas House Public Health Committee — Reps. Four Price and J.D. Sheffield, both Republicans — declined to be interviewed for this article. “It’s not the cost per Medicaid enrollee that’s going up and up,” said Ken Janda, president and CEO of Community Health Choice, a nonprofit HMO for the Houston area. “We have too many poor people. A couple of years ago, there were only 3 million people on Medicaid, and now there’s 4 million people."" The poor are “not immigrants coming over the border. It’s people working at jobs that make minimum wage. These are not people sitting on their front porch waiting for their welfare checks,” Janda said. The poor health outcomes aren’t confined to the uninsured. Employers are increasingly reducing or eliminating altogether subsidies for employees to meet monthly premiums and are shifting to high-deductible plans for their workers. “We all have to be personally accountable for health,” Janda told the audience at a two-day Healthier Texas summit in Austin in October. “But it’s very expensive and it’s very difficult if you have people not getting the care they need because they’ve got a $5,000 deductible.” Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Government System Stores HealthCare.gov User Info 'Indefinitely',2768,"A government data warehouse that stores information indefinitely on millions of HealthCare.gov customers is raising privacy concerns at a time when major breaches have become distressingly common. Known as MIDAS, for Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System, it's described on a federal website as the ""perpetual central repository"" for information collected under President Barack Obama's health care law. ""Data in MIDAS is maintained indefinitely at this time,"" says a government privacy assessment dated Jan. 15. The information stored includes names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, employment status and financial accounts. The vast scope of the data — and the lack of a clear plan for destroying old records — have raised concerns about privacy and the government's judgment on technology. ""A basic privacy principle is that you don't retain data any longer than you have to,"" said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""The more data you keep, the more harm an attacker or unauthorized person can do."" Related: Health Data Breaches: 29 Million U.S. Records Exposed in Four Years The Obama administration says MIDAS is essential to the smooth operation of the health care law's insurance markets and meets or exceeds federal security and privacy standards. ""MIDAS is a critical piece of the marketplace ecosystem,"" said spokesman Aaron Albright. Related: Second Cyberattack on U.S. May Have Exposed Security Information Electronic record-keeping systems are standard for businesses and government agencies. But they are supposed to have limits on how long they store personal data. In the new wired world, every few weeks brings another security breach. Personnel records of millions of federal employees, including background information for security clearances, were compromised in the latest cyberattacks making headlines. Earlier this year, health insurer Anthem reported that information on 80 million customers was hacked. Before HealthCare.gov went live in 2013, Obama administration officials assured lawmakers and the public that an individual's personal information would be used mainly to determine eligibility for coverage, and that the Affordable Care Act would have a limited impact on privacy. MIDAS has been criticized in opinion articles by former Social Security commissioner Michael Astrue, a Republican who disapproves of Obama administration policies. Independent experts on technology and privacy echoed some of the concerns. ""I accept they have an operational reason, if not a legal obligation, to keep data for a reasonable period,"" said Astrue, commissioner from 2007-2013. But there's no justification for keeping data indefinitely, he added.","June 16, 2015"
"Doctors, hospitals take up arms against Democrats' health care changes",9206,"WASHINGTON — Across months of debates, stump speeches, TV appearances and position papers, the face of everything wrong with the U.S. health care industry for Democratic candidates has mostly come down to two groups: private insurers and pharmaceutical companies. But in focusing on those industries, candidates may be leaving supporters unprepared for the fight it would take to pass ""Medicare for All"" or create a public insurance option. In fact, Democratic proposals already face opposition from well-funded groups representing doctors, specialists and hospitals, many of which would be asked to accept major revenue cuts to finance expanded coverage. While Democrats are comfortable attacking bureaucrats, chief executives and Big Pharma, public campaigns to block legislation are likely to include more sympathetic figures from voters' communities like Dr. Asim Shah, executive vice chairman and professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine. Shah, who oversees about 90 staff members at a trauma center in Houston and is known locally for his work treating survivors of Hurricane Harvey, co-wrote an op-ed in The Houston Chronicle last month warning of ""the perils of dismantling the existing structures and moving directly to a government-run plan."" Shah told NBC News that he's not ideologically opposed to a government-led approach but that he's concerned with a simple reality: Medicare pays providers less than private insurance, and almost every 2020 Democratic plan looks to bring down soaring costs by tying more coverage to Medicare. ""Their reimbursement rates are not high,"" he said. ""That's the reason some are scared."" The gap is especially large at hospitals, where an analysis by Rand Health Care found that private insurers pay more than twice as much on average for similar care. The ""Medicare for All"" plan put forth by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential candidate, anticipates lowering health care spending by trillions of dollars by moving physicians to Medicare rates, reimbursing hospitals at an average of 110 percent of Medicare rates and instituting reforms that would cap the growth of health care costs moving forward. Single-payer advocates argue that doing away with private insurance would reduce administrative burdens for doctors and hospitals, meaning they would be able to treat more patients for less. The United States is a major outlier among developed countries when it comes to its high health care costs, and some outside analyses of ""Medicare for All"" proposals suggest that they could produce significant savings by negotiating lower prices and cutting overhead. Donald Berwick, who oversaw Medicare and Medicaid under President Barack Obama and consulted on Warren's plan, said her reimbursement rates were calculated to cover current operating margins for hospitals but would make it harder for them to bargain for higher rates in the future. ""It's definitely stringent, and it would really require hospitals to look very carefully inside for efficiencies, but they should be doing that, anyway,"" Berwick said. Rival approaches short of the ""Medicare for All"" proposals by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another Democratic presidential candidate, would also require new savings from health care providers. Many candidates are proposing a public insurance option that would pay some variation on Medicare rates in part to pressure private insurers to compete with lower premiums and spur providers to lower their prices. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has proposed limiting how much hospitals could charge private insurers relative to Medicare. In a preview of the fight, Congress is struggling to advance legislation to address the sometimes shockingly high and confusing out-of-network hospital bills that patients receive — a much less daunting issue with bipartisan interest, including from the White House — amid an onslaught of outside spending. A new group called Doctor Patient Unity popped up in July and spent over $28 million on ads opposing it through the summer, more than Warren's presidential campaign raised in the last quarter. Its funders were initially unclear, but The New York Times revealed that they were private-equity companies invested in health care. Industry groups opposing ""Medicare for All"" are making the case that they need higher private insurance rates to make up for lower government rates and that customers would suffer from any reductions. The American Hospital Association decried Warren's proposal, arguing that ""hospitals are already paid far less than the cost of caring for Medicare patients"" and that further cuts ""could threaten access to care and hospitals' survival."" Partnership for America's Health Care Future, an umbrella group of health care trade groups that oppose single-payer health care or a public option, has commissioned outside studies raising concerns about the impact of lower reimbursement rates on hospitals struggling with revenue. ""If you assume and put all the population onto Medicare under current reimbursement rates or create a public option that shifts people to current reimbursement rates, you would find the current system we have today in our hospitals would not be able to continue to function,"" Lauren Crawford Shaver, the group's executive director, said in an interview. The crucial fight has been almost entirely overshadowed in the 2020 contest by arguments over replacing existing private insurance with a government plan. To the extent that health care providers have come up, they've often been cast as heroes held back by the existing system. ""People don't like their private insurance companies. They like their doctors and hospitals,"" Sanders said during the first Democratic debate. ""We will substantially lower the cost of health care in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies."" A rare exception came in the same debate, when former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, a former health care executive, warned that single-payer plans would lead to hospital closings or reductions in staff. ""They're going to move everyone to a government payment system and then realize they'll have to raise rates,"" Delaney told NBC News. ""We could have a lower-cost health care system, but it would probably come with limitations on access and limitations on quality."" Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said that voters are receptive to the notion that segments of the industry are gouging customers but that candidates need to be careful in framing the debate. ""People have mixed views about hospitals. It depends on how they get positioned,"" she said. ""If you say 'the for-profit health care industry,' that's a negative frame that can include hospitals and specialists. If it's your family doctor, that's pretty problematic."" The debate over Medicare payments is more complicated than a simple across-the-board cut. The new system could also boost compensation for many doctors and hospitals, creating winners and losers and a scramble of industry lobbying to be on the right side of the equation. Hospitals with many patients who are uninsured or on Medicaid, which pays lower rates than Medicare, could benefit from the change. Warren's plan proposes raising Medicare payments for primary care doctors and cutting them for specialists, who some health care experts argue have too much leverage in price negotiations. The American Medical Association, or AMA, the top industry lobbying group for doctors, opposes ""Medicare for All,"" but its members are closely divided on the issue, and they nearly voted to change their position in August. The AMA withdrew from Partnership for America's Health Care Future shortly afterward. ""Nobody is soaking the doctors or the hospitals,"" said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Care Program, which advocates for a single-payer system. ""It doesn't mean you won't get people who feel they would be less profitable and make less money under the new system."" Grumbling by individual industry players could potentially be solved by raising rates or backing off proposed reforms. Under Obama, for example, Democrats held off on aggressive changes to drug companies in the Affordable Care Act and instead cut a deal to neutralize one major industry threat while imposing bigger changes on others. Legislators in Washington state created a public insurance option this year but set its reimbursement rates at 160 percent of Medicare, only a modest drop from private insurance, to address concerns from health care providers. But finding a politically and technically workable way to finance the more expansive ""Medicare for All"" is difficult. Backing off on cost-cutting measures could raise the price tag by trillions of dollars, making it hard to appease any one group with a quick fix. ""Warren saying everyone has to take a hit is probably the right thing,"" Dr. Stephen Klasko, chief executive of Jefferson Health, a prominent health system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, told NBC News. ""How the public accepts it, how it gets done and what it does for the country hasn't been articulated yet.""","Nov. 11, 2019"

6 ways to help health care workers during coronavirus pandemic,4385,"Sometimes the helpers need help, too. As doctors, nurses and other health care personnel work tirelessly across the country during the coronavirus pandemic, there are ways for everyone to show support for all their hard work. With the number of cases crossing 200,000 worldwide on Wednesday and hospitals in places like Italy stretched to the brink, health care workers have been on the front lines treating coronavirus patients and promoting ways to help slow the spread of the illness. Here are some things you can do to show appreciation for their efforts and help ease some of the burden that health care professionals have shouldered. Uber and Sweetgreen have both announced plans to offer free meals to health care workers and first responders in the coming days. Sweetgreen, a salad-based fast-casual chain, also provided a way for people to make sure their local hospital becomes part of the program to receive some healthy meals when they get a break. People who may be friends or family with health care workers could also have a free meal delivered to them by using UberEats, Postmates or another delivery service. The American Red Cross announced it's experiencing a ""severe blood shortage"" because many blood donation drives have been cancelled or postponed due to the coronavirus. Dr. Jerome Adams, the U.S. Surgeon General, emphasized on TODAY Wednesday that people can still take time out to donate blood while maintaining self-quarantine. ""Another important point, you can still go out and give blood,"" James said. ""We're worried about potential blood shortages in the future. Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement."" You can donate to your local hospital or to organizations like the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which has created a COVID-19 Response Fund to support those affected by coronavirus as well as first responders. If you are looking to help hospitals with supplies, Direct Relief is helping to provide essential medical items and protective equipment to health care workers responding to the coronavirus. Adams also noted on TODAY that Americans simply following the advice of health care experts can have the biggest impact of all. ""What the American people can do is really drive down that demand by staying at home, washing your hands, social distancing,'' Adams said. Getting your information from credible sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization also can help stop the spread of rumors and myths about the illness. If you think you may have coronavirus, these are the important steps you should take, including calling your medical provider first before going to a doctor's office or hospital for treatment. Here are some additional tips on how to protect yourself and your family, properly clean your home and shop for groceries while staying safe. NBC News investigative and consumer correspondent Vicky Nguyen, whose husband is a front line health care worker, summed it up on TODAY Wednesday. ""They are public servants in the highest sense and we can't show them enough of our gratitude,"" she said. ""I feel like there's no better time to shout out these health care workers than in this moment,'' Hoda Kotb added. Citizens of the Italian city of Milan even came together to shower health care workers with applause and a serenade this week in honor of their work. Health care workers with spouses and children are risking their own health to treat others, even if it means being isolated from their own families. Nguyen said her husband has a room designated in their home for isolation if he gets sick, and spouses of health care workers have shared the impact fighting the virus has had on their own families. The hashtag #GetMePPE trended on Twitter as nurses, doctors and other health care workers begged to get more personal protective equipment like N95 masks, respirators and goggles after experiencing shortages of vital items. Panic buying by the public has had some hospitals scrambling to find crucial supplies. ""This is what we were warning people about for weeks,'' Nguyen said on TODAY. ""Please don't go run out and buy the N95 mask. Unless you're on the front lines you don't really need that."" And it potentially could get worse. ""If our curve goes the way of Italy, then there is every chance that we could run out of devices,"" Adams said on TODAY.","March 19, 2020"
Is healthcare forgetting the elderly?,7987,"Ageism is defined as prejudice or discrimination against a particular age group, especially the elderly. The term was first used more than 30 years ago by Dr. Robert N. Butler, the founding Director of the National Institute on Aging, to describe discrimination against the elderly within our healthcare system. But has there been improvement in the healthcare system’s treatment of the elderly population in the last three decades?  Does our healthcare system discriminate against the age group that needs it the most?
Many believe that the lack of training in geriatric medicine is the root of the problem. Often healthcare professionals, because of lack of proper training, make mistaken assumptions or have incorrect beliefs about the type of treatment an elderly patient can endure. Moreover, many doctors feel intense pressure from Medicare, managed care plans, and insurance companies, and try to pack a maximum number of appointments into a day. They may not have the time and training to adequately assess the needs and problems of older patients. To illustrate, a recent survey of students at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, one of the premier medical institutions in the country, showed that 80 percent would admit a 10-year-old girl with pneumonia to intensive care and treat her aggressively, but only 56 percent said they would do the same for an 85-year-old woman. Exacerbating the problem, of course, is that a lack of training in the special needs of elderly patients may be a matter of life and death in many cases.  Finally, many healthcare providers conclude that serious medical problems in elderly patients are simply a matter of getting old. That attitude may result in healthcare providers missing out on opportunities to prevent, treat and enhance the lives of many elderly patients. This problem costs society greatly
By ignoring the medical needs of the elderly, society is impacted greatly. For example, experts say that poor medical attention received by many older Americans leads to premature dependency on government subsidies or on family members who are not prepared for these additional responsibilities. Certainly such discrimination leads to increased levels of mortality and disability, but equally important is the depression and isolation that many older Americans feel when they are deprived of their ability to work, act independently, and to simply enjoy their later years.  Future generations, however, will feel the impact of improper medical care for elderly patients today. For instance, when it is believed that nothing can be done for elderly patients, research is neglected; yet when one recognizes a medical problem, research is enhanced, which obviously has a positive effect in the future.  But an even more startling statistic should alert everyone to the problem: in 2011, the Baby Boom generation will begin to turn 65. While people over 65 made up only 13 percent of the population in 2000, it is projected that by 2030, 20 percent of the population will be age 65 or older. Moreover, the total population over 65 is expected to double in the next 30 years, growing to 70 million people. Obviously, unless attitudes change a large number of people will begin to be directly affected by ageism. Discrimination starts on the preventative level
Discrimination starts on the preventative level. Often older people are denied the kind of preventative care routinely provided to others. Although lack of awareness on the part of both physicians and patients plays a significant role in the disparity of preventative screening measures administered to older patients, findings show that doctors are less aggressive when recommending preventative measures to the elderly. For example, despite the fact that 60 percent of all cancer deaths and 80 percent of all fatal heart attacks afflict men and women age 65 and older, nine out of every ten adults over the age of 65 go without the appropriate screenings according to a 2003 Centers for Disease Control report entitled “Healthy Aging for Older Adults.” Other signs of discrimination
It appears that older people are less likely to be screened for life-threatening diseases than younger people. Studies show that a wide range of diseases and conditions often go unscreened and undetected, including glaucoma, basic cancer tests like pap smears or mammograms, osteoporosis, and even hearing loss. In addition, the mental health of the elderly is often overlooked. Primary care doctors often miss signs of clinical depression and suicidal thoughts in older people (despite the fact that people over 65 had the highest suicide rate of any age group).  Older people are improperly treated routinely by healthcare professionals who have little or no geriatric training. Without casting blame on the system, doctors, often out of ignorance or unconscious bias, may discount or misattribute certain problems to natural aging rather than disease.  In addition, proven medical interventions for older people are often ignored, leading to inappropriate or incomplete treatment. This problem is particularly true as it relates to chemotherapy to be given to elderly cancer patients. It is commonly believed that elderly patients cannot tolerate chemotherapy, yet recent studies show that they can. Finally, older people are consistently underrepresented in clinical trials, a particularly troubling situation because many of the drugs or procedures that are being tested will be used by elderly patients, who comprise the largest segment of the population getting the diseases. Preventing discrimination: Ask questions.
Come to the doctor with a list of questions and concerns on paper. Try to visit the doctor with another person so that two sets of ears will hear the responses to the questions. If you cannot attend with another person, tape record the conversation with your doctor so that you can listen to his or her answers later. Give Complete Information.
Be sure to give your doctor or other healthcare professional complete information when you visit. Don’t hold back because you believe information is unimportant or trivial — let the doctor decide what’s important. Only with complete information can the doctor give a proper diagnosis and prescribe treatment or drugs to treat your problem. Gather Information.
Get as much information as you can from your doctor. Try to understand what he or she believes your problem to be and how it will be treated. Also, don’t neglect the Internet, which can be a fertile source of medical information. Understand as much as you can about your problem so that you can assist in your treatment. Contact Others.
Don’t neglect to contact nurses, pharmacists, social workers and dieticians. They are important to your understanding of the treatment or the drugs you are taking, what social systems are available to help you in your time of need, and how to plan meals that will best serve you while you are undergoing treatment. Advocate with respect.
Healthcare professionals have the medical expertise, but the service, attention and quality of care required doesn’t always come automatically. You or your loved one must often take an active role in getting the best service possible — but you must advocate with respect.  Remember that the doctor or nurse is often under a great deal of pressure and while your concerns are the most important to you, the doctor or nurse has the broader responsibility of attending to the care of many other patients.  Help is available: AARP has a wealth of information on this subject. Contact the AARP at http://www.aarp.org/, or call 800-424-3410.

"Experts: HealthCare.gov fix needs more time, money",4691,"Technology experts say healing what ails the Healthcare.gov website will be a tougher task than the Obama administration acknowledges.
 ""It's going to cost a lot of tax dollars to get this done,"" says Bill Curtis, senior vice president and chief scientist at CAST, a French software analysis company with offices in the U.S. Curtis says programmers and systems analysts start fixing troubled websites by addressing the glitches they can see. But based on his analysis, he believes the ongoing repairs are likely to reveal even deeper problems, making it tough to predict when all the site's issues will be resolved. ""Will it eventually work? Yes, because they have to make it work,"" he says. “But it'll be very expensive."" Curtis and other technology executives say the site's problems are the result of poor management of its many working parts. They also believe, as congressional testimony has revealed, the site suffered from a lack of testing once all its systems were in place. The federal health insurance exchange website —which cost taxpayers more than $600 million to build, according to the Government Accountability Office— has been crippled by technical problems since its Oct. 1 launch. Since then, everyone from top White House officials to the contractors who worked on the site have been called before congressional committees to determine what went wrong and who is to blame. The White House originally promised to have the site running smoothly by the end of November. But at a news conference last week, President Obama said he couldn't guarantee that the site will be completely bug free by then. The HealthCare.gov site is supposed to serve as a marketplace where people can enter their personal information, search and sign up for required health care coverage. But the site is a patchwork quilt of sorts. It pulls together a slew of contributions from various government contractors and attempts to join the structure with the systems of participating insurance companies. Experts say the amount of information coursing through HealthCare.gov dwarfs that of any other government website, making it more similar to a high-traffic e-commerce operation such as Amazon.com or eBay. They contend the government didn't design the site with the kind of retail-like infrastructure it needs to keep up with demand and failed to knit its pieces together in an efficient way. Curtis says visible parts of the website's programming code reveal a host of analytic and data coordination failures — a red flag that the site wasn't designed by people with a lot of experience building high-traffic websites. He notes that government projects are typically awarded to the lowest bid, a factor that limits the amount of money a contractor can make. As a result, bid-winners don't always assign their top people to those jobs. Himanshu Sareen, CEO of Icreon Tech, a New York-based web and mobile design and development firm, says the government has made some progress fixing the site in recent weeks, but there are still big problems. He worries that it is operating at half the capacity it needs to. Indeed, fewer than 27,000 people signed up for insurance through the federal website during the first month of open enrollment in the 36 states, according to federal health officials. Nearly 1 million more applied for coverage and were waiting to finalize decisions. Sareen says he's shocked that so few people have been able to sign up. He says the government should focus on fixing the website's telephone support centers, the place where many frustrated insurance seekers are looking for help. Michael Smith, a vice president of product development and operations for Compuware Corp., says the site's operations have improved significantly. Recent testing of HealthCare.gov's visible parts done by Compuware APM show seven states with unacceptable response times, down from 26 states on Oct. 25. Even so, Smith says the government needs to inform the public that it takes time and patience to fix problem websites. ""They're building something that's never been built before, so there's no prescription for how to do it,"" Smith says. And there's no better way to improve public opinion than to fix the site as quickly as possible, says Wally Krantz, creative director for The Brand Union, a global brand strategy consultancy that works with clients ranging from Time Warner Cable to The Coca-Cola Co. Krantz says people will forget about its technical problems once they get their insurance coverage. ""If they ultimately get the website working, it'll just be another thing that people who want it to fail will bring up,"" Krantz says. ""I don't think this story has legs beyond that.""","Nov. 21, 2013"
Trump's backing a healthcare plan that breaks his promises,6685,"President Donald Trump rode to the White House making big promises on health care — pledges that he is now in serious danger of breaking. Let's look at how the president's words on the campaign trail stack up against what we know today. In addition to Trump's comments on the stump, his administration has spent weeks raising expectations on its Obamacare replacement. Among the claims: The Republican plan would cover more people, reduce their premiums and costs, avoid cutting Medicaid, and leave no one worse off than under the former president's signature achievement. So now that the House GOP's American Health Care Act (AHCA) is here, how do these pledges look? Not good, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released on Monday. The report found the House plan — which the Trump administration has thrown its support behind — would cause millions to lose insurance and raise costs for vulnerable populations. The White House pushed back against the report, claiming the findings were not accurate, but some independent analysts have made similar predictions. Here's a look at where we are: “We’re going to have insurance for everybody”— Donald Trump, Washington Post interview, 01/15/2017 Trump was clear both as a candidate and as president: No one would be left behind under his health care plan. ""We're gonna come up with a new plan that's going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost,” Trump told ABC’s David Muir in January. “Everybody’s got to be covered,” he said on CBS' “60 Minutes” in 2015. In addition to Trump’s comments, the House GOP website denies that people will lose coverage under the Republican bill and Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney told CBS News last week he believed the legislation “will cover more” people. ""We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” in January. The House bill would fall far short of these promises, according to the CBO. By the agency's estimate, 14 million fewer people would be insured in 2018 versus current law and a whopping 24 million fewer people would have insurance in 2026. Some people would voluntarily drop their coverage because the bill repeals the individual mandate that requires people to buy insurance, but others “would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.” The coverage losses would be “disproportionately larger among older people with lower income,” according to the CBO, who would face higher premiums under the House GOP bill and less federal aid to pay for them. ""I firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we're going through” — Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" 03/12/2017 Trump and his allies emphasized affordability, saying their Obamacare replacement would lower premiums and provide more help for out-of-pocket costs. Trump, for example, told the Washington Post that Americans would see “much lower deductibles” in January and complained on Monday that under the current system “deductibles are so high you don’t even get to use [insurance].” He promised “great health care for a fraction of the price” in a speech in Las Vegas last year. The CBO news is mixed, but overall its estimates show these goals won't be met. The analysis is especially harsh when it comes to Price’s claim “nobody will be worse off financially.” Instead, it finds some of the patients who need coverage the most would see their costs soar. Related: White House says CBO has it wrong on health care Health insurance premiums would initially rise 15% to 20% than they would under current law, but would eventually decrease, ending up 10% lower than Obamacare’s projected prices by 2026. But costs wouldn’t go down for everyone and the worst hit by the GOP plan would be one of the most vulnerable groups: Older patients. While CBO projects the average 21 year old could expect a 20-25% decrease in their premiums, a 64-year-old would see their premiums go up 20-25%. This is because of a change in the law that would allow insurers to charge older customers more than they can under Obamacare. But it gets much worse for these patients: Most people who get individual insurance through Obamacare receive subsidies and older customers would get less help under the House GOP plan. The bill would give people a fixed amount of help while Obamacare’s subsidies rise according to their income and the price of insurance. For a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year, the effects would be devastating: They would pay, on average, $1,700 total for health insurance under Obamacare in 2026, but $14,600 under the House bill. On the other end, some higher-income seniors and younger customers would pay less for insurance than they do now. As for lowering costs and deductibles, the CBO projects that “individuals’ cost-sharing payments, including deductibles, in the nongroup market would tend to be higher” under the House bill. The bill reduces premiums by allowing insurers to offer plans that cover fewer expenses. But it runs directly afoul of Trump’s personal pledge just two months ago to lower deductibles. The White House argues it can bring premiums down further by loosening regulations on what insurers have to provide, but that could face legal challenges and it’s not clear how far the administration can go without further legislation. ""I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid” — Donald Trump, Daily Signal interview, 05/21/2015 Trump said in his speech announcing his run for president that he would “save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts” and bragged on Twitter that he was the first Republican contender to make that pledge. But the CBO found Trump would break his promise — by a mile. Related: Trump voters would be hit hardest by healthcare changes Obamacare expanded Medicaid to cover about 11 million more people, but the House bill would reduce Medicaid spending by $880 billion by 2026, at which point it would spend a full 25% less than under current law. This would leave many people without coverage: 14 million Medicaid patients would fall off the rolls, according to the CBO projection. This could have repercussions for another Trump promise to “give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need” which he made in a speech on the topic last October. A number of lawmakers, including key Republicans, have expressed concern that cuts and changes to Medicaid could affect patients who receive substance abuse treatment through the program.","March 14, 2017"

Obama Vetoes Health Care Repeal Bill,1699,"President Obama vetoed a bill Friday aimed at repealing his signature health care law. ""This legislation would not only repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, but would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in America,"" the president wrote members of the House in a letter. ""Republicans in the Congress have attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act over 50 times. Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs,"" the letter continued. ""Because of the harm this bill would cause to the health and financial security of millions of Americans, it has earned my veto."" The president's veto comes after the House's recent passage this week almost entirely along party-lines, 240 to 181, to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood. Just one Democrat voted for the bill and three Republicans voted against it. The Senate passed the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act in December. It was successful because Republicans used the process of budget reconciliation that prevented a filibuster by Senate Democrats. Related: Congress Sends Obamacare Repeal to President for First Time Since the law's passage, Republicans in Congress over the past few years have authored dozens of unsuccessful attempts to repeal all or part of the health care law.

'Stress tests' show Healthcare.gov was overloaded,3758,"Internal documents obtained exclusively by NBC News reveal that ""stress tests"" done to a key component of Healthcare.gov the day before the website went live showed it could only handle 1100 users at once before it became overloaded. ""Currently we are able to reach 1100 users before response time gets too high,"" the report says of a test done on Sept. 30. It added that website developer CGI Federal was ""making changes to configuration."" The internal documents, released by Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, are titled the “ACA Daily Testing Bulletin,” and show a list of tests done by the contractor QSSI in the days surrounding the site’s roll-out. Read the report here (.pdf) QSSI has since been tasked by the Obama administration to lead the repairs needed on the website. Also revealed in the documents is a “target” by contractors for the website to be able to handle “up to 10,000 concurrent users” in the first days after the launch.  That goal  was much lower than benchmarks expressed by the Obama administration, who said in a report in USA Today that they expected to have 50,000 to 60,000 concurrent users in the site’s first days. The documents reiterate well-documented problems with the website that occurred after its initial rollout on Oct. 1. Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for HHS, responded by saying “As we have said many times, there’s no question we wish we had done more testing,” and said that HHS is “now working around the clock to improve the consumer experience on HealthCare.gov.” “One of the items we have ticked off our punch list is response times for page loads, which we have reduced dramatically from eight seconds to less than one second,” Peters said, “Moving forward, the team is focused on diagnosing and fixing every tech issue as it is identified.” The White House has blamed the initial issues with Healthcare.gov on higher than expected traffic, and contractors have pointed towards late changes to the website’s workflow for the high number of users on Day One. ""It appears that one of the reasons for the high concurrent volume at the registration system was a late decision requiring consumers to register for an account before they could browse for insurance products,"" QSSI’s Andrew Slavitt told a House Committee on Oct. 24. Issues with the website continue to result in questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was asked Wednesday at a Senate hearing if a temporary shutdown of the site would be beneficial. Sebelius, who said they had identified “a couple of hundred functional fixes” that needed to be addressed, said a temporary shutdown wasn't the answer. “Given the fact that the various fixes, particularly the functionality fixes, the codes, have to be written in batches, it's been advised that you don't gain much from just taking the whole system down for a week, a couple of weeks,” Sebelius told the Senate Finance Committee, “It's better to do this on an ongoing basis.” Sebelius told the Committee that the Obama Administration would be releasing preliminary enrollment numbers next week, but warned that the numbers are  “going to be very low.” Also Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is managing the rollout of Healthcare.gov, announced that a top official in charge of overseeing the website’s launch is stepping down.  Tony Trenkle, the Director of the Office of Information Services, will leave CMS for the private sector, an official for CMS confirmed to reporters today.  The official would not say whether Trenkle’s departure is related to the rollout of Healthcare.gov, but did say the decision to leave was his own.

5 key questions await developers of healthcare.gov,8651,"Executives of companies that built key parts of the federal government’s troubled health-insurance website will have some explaining to do when they appear before a congressional committee Thursday, just weeks after the companies assured the lawmakers that the healthcare.gov website was on course for a smooth launch. Since executives from the companies last appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Sept. 10, the website that is a critical to implementing President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act has gotten off to a rocky start, with technical glitches preventing many consumers from even creating accounts, much less signing up for health insurance. The problems with the online exchange -- intended to allow Americans to comparison shop for coverage and then sign up for their preferred policy -- have fired up critics of the “Obamacare” law, giving them new hope that they can delay it or even repeal it. The early snafu also has prompted a full-court press by the administration to get it up and running, thereby containing the political damage and keeping implementation of the law on schedule. It’s against this tumultuous backdrop that officials of two of the main contractors hired to build the website – CGI Federal, the lead firm on healthcare.gov with $300 million in contracts, and software maker QSSI – will testify on Thursday. The executives can expect a rough reception, both from opponents of the law, who may try to get them to blame the website's woes on the complex law, and its defenders, who will likely try to deflect the blame onto the private firms. Here are five key questions the execs are likely to be grilled on, and some of the key issues they will have to explain: What is causing the website’s problems? Fingers are pointing in different directions. Obama administration officials have blamed an unexpected surge of interest after the Oct. 1 launch for the problems. As recently as Tuesday night, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said of the number of visitors: “I think volume was extremely high.” That line is expected to be echoed Thursday by the executives. ""After the launch, healthcare.gov was inundated by many more consumers than anticipated,"" Vice President Andrew Slavitt of QSSI, which developed software for user-account creation and the critical data hub that the site uses to communicate with federal databases, wrote in testimony prepared for the hearing. ""Many of the critical components developed by these multiple vendors were overwhelmed."" Slavitt also said a requirement that users register before browsing was added far along in the development process, and that feature contributed to the website’s responsiveness. But many outside software and website developers say that problems in coding and the way the website communicates with federal and state databases are bigger issues. That’s partly due to the speed at which healthcare.gov was built and launched, they say, noting that federal contracts for the site were awarded in 2011, but the specifications weren’t completed until March. “It’s a difficult thing to launch something on scale of an Amazon, from zero to something like 30 million users,” Chet Wisniewski, senior security adviser for IT security firm Sophos, told NBC News. “Amazon spent years building the infrastructure and the knowledge and a team that understands how to knit it all together on this huge database.” Zach Sims, co-founder of Codeacademy, which offers free online coding classes in programming languages, said that too many hands also may have been involved. He noted that big e-commerce sites “have in-house technology teams that are able to work together seamlessly, whereas healthcare.gov was contracted out to several separate firms, each responsible for a different component of the architecture. This lack of collaboration likely made it difficult for each piece to function correctly as a whole.” Still some of the problems seem rudimentary. Sam Reed, a javascript developer, pointed to one section of code that set the maximum number of state codes at 50 – failing to recognize that the list includes the District of Columbia, meaning Wyoming gets left out. Can the site be fixed? Obama administration officials have expressed confidence that the existing site can be fixed, and both CGI Federal Vice President Cheryl Campbell and Slavitt state that their companies are committed to making it work. “Our top priority is to improve the consumer experience,” Campbell said in her written testimony. Some experts agree the site is fixable. “Can we ever have a website that delivers on what it was expected to do?” said John Engates, chief technology officer at Rackspace Hosting. “Yes. You’re not breaking the laws of physics.” But others have their doubts. John McAfee, controversial founder of the Internet security company McAfee Inc. and a staunch critic of the site, said the whole thing should be scrapped. “If indeed you are going to do the right thing and start over, how are you going to convince us that it will be done right?” asked McAfee, who has said he was approached by House Republicans for guidance on the site’s troubled launch.   Can it be fixed in time for key deadlines? That is a key question, Engates said, especially considering the complex technical issues, such as the requirement for the site to communicate seamlessly with multiple databases. The White House reaffirmed a key deadline Wednesday, saying people have until March 31 to sign up even if the coverage doesn’t kick in till later. The clarification is unrelated to the troubled rollout of the online exchanges, according to administration officials. But lawmakers – including some Democrats – have called for delays in the mandate because of the website’s woes. Delays of any sort might disrupt health insurance markets by making the participant pool smaller and disproportionately sicker, as Business Insider reported. That could cause insurers to raise rates for 2015. But insurers say that there’s still time to fix the site. ""This is a marathon and not a sprint,"" Karen Ignagni, head of the trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement a few days after the rollout. Engates said members of the House committee should ask how long it would take to get the system working correctly and the reasons for confidence in that estimate.  Who’s going to fix it? Obama has called for a “tech surge” of repairs to the site and Tuesday said he had tapped a former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeff Zients, to oversee the cleanup. But the administration has not named who might be on that surge team – another question that Engates said should be answered immediately. Private efforts to help are also under way. One early element of the site that excited outside developers was that the source code for the site was opened for anyone to look at, through the code repository site GitHub. Dave Cole, a developer for Development Seed, the small District of Columbia company that built the front end of healthcare.gov, wrote in a blog post last March that opening up the code for the website could help the individual online health exchanges being built by states. “They can easily check out and build upon the work being done at the federal level,” he said. But after the problems began with the Oct. 1 rollout, the government shut down the repository without explanation. Reed, the javascript developer, then launched his own repository of the site’s code on GitHub to solicit fixes. While critical of some of the coding problems he found, Reed does offer some sympathy to developers on government projects like those at CGI Federal. “The environment doesn’t reward performance, the bureaucracy is maddening and all of us could get better-paying jobs elsewhere,” he said. Others are also jumping in to diagnose and try to fix problems. And finally, who is to blame? In the end, said software and Web-development experts, alarms should have been raised if testing showed that there were problems. And that rests on the companies, not the administration, Engates said. “That’s their job to tell the guy paying the bill what’s likely to happen,” he said. “They’re the closest to the code to see what’s happening.” Still, the buck may roll up to the Obamacare law anyway, said Wisniewski, the Sophos expert. “My mom and dad are quite elderly, and if something goes wrong, they’re going to blame Obamacare, because they don’t know the difference,” he said. “And they shouldn’t have to know the difference.” NBC News’ Helen Popkin and Frank Thorp contributed to this report.

Average Family Healthcare Costs Have Tripled Since 2001,4549,"The costs of providing health care to an average American family surpassed $25,000 for the first time in 2016 — even as the rate of health cost increases slowed to a record low, a new analysis revealed Tuesday. The $25,826 in health-care costs for a typical family of four covered by a employer-sponsored ""preferred provider plan"" is $1,155 higher than last year, and triple what it cost to provide health care for the same family in 2001, the first year that Milliman Medical Index analysis was done. And it's the 11th consecutive year that the total dollar increase in the average family's health-care costs exceeded $1,110, actuarial services firm Milliman noted as it released the index. A significant cost driver identified by the index was the rapid growth in what health plans and insured people are paying for prescription drugs, which now comprise almost 17 percent of the total spending on health care, or an average of $4,270 annually. That's four times the prescription drug costs borne by an average family in 2001, although the index did not factor in the effect of pharmaceutical company rebates, which can reduce the total drug costs and which are becoming more common. Read More from CNBC: Study Claims Fitbit Trackers Are 'Highly Inaccurate' The costs detailed by the index include the health insurance premiums paid by both the employer and the employee, as well as the actual expenditures for health care paid by the insurance plan and out of pocket by the insured family. While employers pay 57 percent of the total health costs, that percentage has shrunk from 61 percent in 2001. But the Milliman Medical Index report said that 2016's 4.7 percent increase in health-care costs for an average family of four seen in 2016 marks the lowest rate of increase since the index began in 2001, and only about half the percentage the index has reported in past years. ""We seem to be wrestling the curve down to sustainable levels,"" the index's report said. Still, Chris Girod, co-author of the Milliman Medical Index, said that topping the $25,000 mark in health-care costs was ""a significant and somewhat unsettling milestone."" And, as in past years, the index revealed that health-care costs for families insured by employer-based insurance plans were increasing faster than either the rate for overall national medical price increases or the overall consumer price index. The index notes that ""many people wonder how costs can be so high, especially if they only visit the doctor for preventative visits and occasional routine care."" But the index added that ""the disconnect"" may be partly due to the fact that about 80 percent of health-care costs come from just 20 percent of the population, whose use of medical services drives up insurance plan premiums for the others. The $25,000 milestone comes amid the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but it is not primarily a consequence of that health-care reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, according to Scott Weitz, another co-author of the index. Read More from CNBC: Clinton Medicare Plan Could Cover 13 Million, But Boost Some Obamacare Costs ""We really haven't seen much of an impact here,"" said Weitz, when asked if Obamacare had any effect on the cost increases identified by the index. Conversely, Weitz said, it's also not clear whether Obamacare played a role in the slowing of the rate of cost increases in the past five years or so. The Obama administration has pointed to the overall slowdown in health-cost growth in recent years as a sign of the success of such initiatives. The ACA includes a number of provisions designed to bend the health inflation cost curve, including changing the way Medicare pays for health services, and encouraging doctors and hospitals to form organizations that are paid more based on medical outcomes than on a fee-per-service basis. Employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, the type tracked by the Milliman Medical Index is by far the biggest source of health coverage in the United States. About 155 million employees and their family members are covered through such job-based plans. In comparison, about 77 million people are covered by Medicaid, the government program for primarily poor people. Another 57 million or so are covered by Medicare, the government program for mainly senior citizens. Another 12 million or so people are covered by private, individual health plans sold on government-run Obamacare exchanges. Several million others are covered by individual plans sold outside of the exchanges.","May 25, 2016"

Open-source advocates to government: Let us help you fix healthcare.gov,6989,"As computer experts hired by the U.S. government scramble to fix the much-maligned healthcare.gov website, a corps of independent kibitzers is chiming in from around the world, publicizing coding flaws that they’ve discovered and offering suggestions for fixing them. Much of the constructive criticism is coming from members of the “open source” community, a passionate but loose-knit group that advocates openness and collaboration as a means of writing better computer software. Their desire to help solve the federal government’s website woes in part stems from an early decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to make the healthcare.gov code available for examination – a promise that was never fully fulfilled. Sam Reed, a JavaScript developer from Washington, D.C., currently working in Hong Kong, is one of the driving forces in the effort. When healthcare.gov ran into trouble immediately after its Oct. 1 launch, he downloaded key parts of the code, shared it into an online repository at GitHub and set about analyzing and improving it. He also invited others to do the same in the hopes that federal contractors on the project would see their work. “If we can get the open-source community involved in the issue, people in the trenches (working for the government) can see the fixes,” said Reed, who has previously worked on government projects. It’s not clear whether HHS or the federal contractors that created various components of healthcare.gov -- most notably Quality Sofware Systems Inc., or QSSI, and CGI Federal, which was in charge of making all the parts of the system work together -- are taking notice of the independent efforts. CGI Federal declined to comment to NBC News, and a request to QSSI for comment went unanswered. HHS also didn't respond to requests for comment.  It is well established that the government’s website, which is critical to getting consumers to sign up for Obamacare, has been plagued with usability problems since it went live. It also has suffered outages that continued this week, including a failure Tuesday night at a Verizon Terramark data center that persisted into Wednesday and provided an embarrassing moment for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius when she testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Last Friday, White House economic adviser Jeff Zients, who has been tasked with fixing the site, said that QSSI would oversee the job. “We are confident that by the end of the November, healthcare.gov will be smooth for the vast majority of users,” he said. Since then, HHS has held daily briefings for reporters and listed improvements on a blog. Reed, however, said he has already produced a simpler, cleaner version of the software that could run on the desktop of consumers’ personal computers, allowing them to create accounts, browse insurance plans and sign up for coverage – all without many of the headaches that have been plaguing the government’s site. Among the changes Reed said he has made to his version of the site: Reed noted that programmers working to fix healthcare.gov have addressed some of the same issues he has found. Peter Durham, a software architect at NBC News, reviewed Reed’s work on GitHub and agreed that the changes would make the site run faster on computers with slower connections, although the difference would not be as apparent with faster connections. He also pointed out that Reed’s version must still communicate with the same servers at various government agencies and contractors that the real healthcare.gov accesses, so it would still be susceptible to outages like the one at Terramark. Other independent efforts have focused on security issues. Ben Simo, a software tester based in Phoenix and a past president of the Association of Software Testers, said his involvement stemmed from trying to retrieve his own password on healthcare.gov. When he did so, he said, he found that his username and password reset code were being returned to his browser without authentication, a potential security hole. Simo said that he reported the flaw on the site’s help line and by Monday, it was fixed. But he said the same information was still being passed to third-party analytics companies, a practice that he called inappropriate. He said Thursday that that flaw, too, had been fixed. (A summary of the issues found before the latest fix are available on his blog.) Reed argues that making this an open-source project would have contributed to the site’s security. “Hiding the code and assuming that nobody will be able to get into it because they cannot find it is not real security,” he said. “If anything, I think it makes (a site) susceptible because it creates a false sense of security.” Open-source advocates were excited when Health and Human Services CTO Bryan Sivak said this spring that the code for the site would be open for examination. But only the part of the front-end code produced by Development Seed was made available through GitHub, and that effort has been criticized by open-source advocates as incomplete. Then, after the Oct. 1 launch of healthcare.gov, people started using the comments section to vent anger about the site’s usability rather than talking about the code itself. The repository was removed at the government’s request. That prompted Reed to go into healthcare.gov and grab the files that run the marketplace enrollment application, code that was built by CGI Federal. He put those files on GitHub and asked other coders and programmers to look for problems and suggest fixes that would make the site run more smoothly.    Matthew McCall, an open-source advocate who has been a Presidential Innovation Fellow, has posted a petition on the White House website asking the government to release all the source code written by CGI Federal. “It is believed that the enrollment issues with healthcare.gov are likely due to poor coding practices in components that are unavailable to the world's development community to evaluate,” the petition says. “Please release the code so we may help fix any found issues.” By Thursday, however, the petition had fewer than 3,000 of the 100,000 signatures needed by Nov. 19 to gain a response from the Obama administration. In the meantime, the public appears divided on whether the website is repairable. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken over the weekend, 37 percent said these are short-term technical woes that can be fixed, while 31 percent believe they point to a longer-term issue with the law’s design that can’t be corrected, and 30 percent think it’s too soon to say. “The only option is to fix it,” said Reed, who believes that starting over from the ground up, as some have suggested the government do, isn’t practical because of the amount of time that would take. “And the code is fixable. It’s not the worst code that I’ve ever seen.” Related: More from NBC News Investigations: Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook","Nov. 1, 2013"

BIO-key and Lumidigm Bring Reliable E-Prescribing to Genesis HealthCare,8430,"WALL, N.J., and ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Feb. 16, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BIO-key International, Inc. (OTCBB:BKYI), a leader in finger-based biometric identification solutions, and Lumidigm, Inc., the multispectral imaging biometrics company, have partnered to provide a strong authentication solution for e-prescriptions at Genesis HealthCare System. Today, Genesis HealthCare is utilizing BIO-key's biometric identification software with Lumidigm fingerprint sensors so staff may quickly, conveniently and securely establish identity when ordering, verifying or administering medications as required by Ohio law. Genesis HealthCare System, based in Zanesville Ohio, has 200 centers throughout the eastern United States. For years, doctors and pharmacists in Ohio have been required to use two-factor authentication when electronically prescribing controlled substances, and as of June 2010, the DEA has also mandated two-factor authentication for electronically prescribing controlled substances nationwide. Genesis HealthCare is able to meet these requirements using BIO-key's biometric fingerprint identification software and Lumidigm biometric sensors. Currently, 2,000 clinicians and staff are using BIO-key fingerprint biometrics leveraging Lumidigm multispectral imaging sensors to establish their identity in Genesis's Epic software to order, verify or administer medications. In the next phase of this project, Genesis will be implementing fingerprint biometric user logon with Vergence, a single sign-on solution from Sentillion, a Microsoft company. With these solutions in place, Genesis staff members will instantly establish their identity with the simple touch of a finger, even when wearing latex gloves. This BIO-key identification solution, in conjunction with Lumidigm readers, is integrated with all major electronic medical records (EMR) software suites, including Epic and Allscript's Enterprise HER, as well as major single sign-on (SSO) providers, including Microsoft's Sentillion, Evidian, IBM, Oracle, CA and more. ""With BIO-key as our partner, we were able to be up and running from the initial inception in less than five months. A lot of vendors talk about being our partner; BIO-key didn't talk, they delivered,"" said Ed Romito, vice president and CIO of Genesis HealthCare. ""Additionally, BIO-key's ability to operate with every major fingerprint reader manufacturer allowed us to evaluate a variety of readers to determine which would work best in our environment. As a result of our testing, we determined that Lumidigm's Mercury sensor provided us with the best performance, including the ability for our staff working in isolation rooms to establish their identity when wearing latex gloves!"" ""Individual physicians frequently sign tens, if not hundreds, of prescriptions daily. With BIO-key fingerprint identification and Lumidigm sensors, this process is more secure, faster and extremely convenient, compared to the other two-factor alternatives,"" added Mike DePasquale, CEO of BIO-key International. ""With BIO-key's ability to operate on mobile platforms including tablets and smart phones, combined with the capabilities and value that Lumidigm's multispectral imaging technology brings to our customers, other markets will also be able to benefit from our partnership."" ""Because skin dryness is so prevalent in the healthcare industry, due in part to constant hand washing, traditional fingerprint sensors can produce up to a twenty percent failure rate,"" explains Bill Spence, Lumidigm vice president of transaction systems. ""In other situations, when the policy allows it, healthcare workers wearing latex gloves do not want to remove them to use the biometric reader. Lumidigm's Mercury Series multispectral fingerprint sensors capture fingerprint data beneath the surface of the skin so that dryness or gloves create no problems for reliable reads."" The Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances rule was issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as an amendment to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, commonly known as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). According to the rule, the doctor or pharmacist creating the prescription must authenticate with two of the following: ""something you know (a knowledge factor), something you have (a hard token stored separately from the computer being accessed), and something you are (biometric information). The hard token, if used, must be a cryptographic device or a one-time-password device that meets Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 Security Level 1."" For increased security, less complicated management and ease of doctor/pharmacist use, most healthcare organizations prefer that one of the authentication factors be biometric. A demonstration of the BIO-key / Lumidigm e-prescribing solution will be featured in Booth #5242 at the HIMSS11 Exhibition on February 21-23 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Fla. The research firm of Frost & Sullivan recently awarded the New Product Innovation of the Year Award, Fingerprint Biometrics, North America, 2010, to Lumidigm. According to Frost & Sullivan, Lumidigm's ""innovative technology allows Lumidigm fingerprint sensors to provide highly accurate biometric data even in adverse conditions where traditional fingerprint sensors fail.""

Finding A Doctor Trained in Transgender Health a Hurdle,3587,"After James Parker Sheffield medically transitioned six years ago — requiring hormone replacement therapy and chest reconstructive surgery — he faced major challenges in getting adequate healthcare. The Georgia native not only had to travel more than 40 miles to see a doctor trained in transgender health, he had to seek that care at a clinic for women. Sheffield, who was born a female, says it’s not unusual for transgender patients to encounter a series of such hurdles in the search for medical care. “If we're fortunate enough to afford care, we then have to find a physician that is welcoming and understanding of our status as trans,” said Sheffield, 36. “In rural areas, or even some suburban areas, those physicians don't exist. This often means traveling extreme distances to see a doctor, which then creates the obstacle of transportation and time resources.” Despite the recent attention paid to transgender rights across the globe, Sheffield’s story is an all too common reminder that there still remains a dearth of proper information by and for healthcare professionals. That is the focus of a series of special articles on transgender health published this week by medical journal The Lancet. The collection of studies and editorials highlights the significant health inequities — both social and legal — that the transgender community of an estimated 25 million people across the world faces. Related: Study: Transgender People Face Health Challenges Worldwide “Many of the health challenges faced by transgender people are exacerbated by laws and policies that deny them gender recognition. In no other community is the link between rights and health so clearly visible as in the transgender community,” said one of the lead authors for the series, Associate Professor Sam Winter of Curtin University in Australia. “Faced with stigma, discrimination and abuse, transgender people are pushed to the margins of society, excluded from the workplace, their families and health care.” As a result of this social and legal discrimination, transgender people have high rates of depression — reportedly up to 60 percent, are at greater risk of drug use and are at almost 50 times greater risk of HIV than the general population. The study authors note that although some clinical services for transgender people, including gender-affirming surgery, are best delivered by a medical specialist, most healthcare needs can be delivered by a primary care physician. Some schools are trying to introduce the concept of transgender health to medical students early on. At Georgetown University's School of Medicine, the issue has become a standard part of the curriculum. Related: New Federal Health Regs Would Protect All Genders “The only way to combat stigma in healthcare is to train young physicians properly,” said Dr. Dana Beyer, who teaches at Georgetown and is the executive director for Gender Rights Maryland. “Now that there is growing insurance coverage, there is a developing phenomenon of gender clinics across the United States. Young physicians notice that, read about trans people in the news, recognize there is a need, and are willing to train.” Sheffield finally found a doctor able to treat his health needs and now works with a nonprofit LGBT health organization helping others find the care that he had struggled with procuring early on. “There are simple ways to allow more room for someone to be who they are and to treat them with respect,” Sheffield said. “Education is an important step and doctors should be able to treat all of their patients equally.”","June 18, 2016"
Intubated Covid-19 patient plays violin to thank health care workers,1697,"A retired orchestra teacher who was hospitalized with Covid-19 played his violin as a tribute to nurses and doctors who had been caring for him. Grover Wilhelmsen, who was hospitalized at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, Utah, for over a month, couldn’t speak while intubated and instead communicated with the health care staff through writing. After writing to Ciara Sase, a nurse and one of his caregivers, that he wanted to play his violin to thank the staff, Sase coordinated with Wilhelmsen’s wife of 47 years to bring the instrument into the hospital. As long as Sase stayed in his room to monitor his vitals, doctors agreed that Wilhelmsen could play. In a video posted on YouTube by the hospital’s parent company Intermountain Healthcare, Wilhelmsen can be heard playing the ""Tennessee Waltz"" while Sase looks on. Although ICU rooms are kept shut, Sase said she turned on her Vocera, a communication device used in hospital settings, so her colleagues could hear Wilhelmsen play. “It brought tears to my eyes. For all the staff to see a patient doing this while intubated was unbelievable,” Sase said, according to a press release from Intermountain Healthcare. “Even though he was so sick, he was still able to push through. You could see how much it meant to him. Playing kind of helped to soothe his nerves and brought him back to the moment.” Sase said Wilhelmsen played his violin for staff multiple times for a couple days. He was recently discharged from the ICU to a long-term care facility where he’s expected to make a full recovery, the hospital said. Covid-19 cases are rising rapidly throughout the country, including in Utah, which has reported over 160,000 cases and 740 deaths.","Nov. 20, 2020"
Fact Check: Trump says he has the votes on health care. But he doesn't.,2713,"President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that Republicans have the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare — and that the party would be well on its way to doing so if it weren't for a sick senator and Senate rules. ""We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy,"" Trump said, adding that he needs to wait ""a few months"" before seeking a vote. But there's no evidence Trump has these votes, with or without Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who is home recovering from an illness in Mississippi. Here's how the numbers break down: The GOP has 52 senators, and 50 ""yes"" votes could pass the bill this month under Senate rules. Thanks to Vice President Mike Pence's ability to cast the tie-breaking vote, should all 48 Democratic senators vote ""no,"" the bill could lose two Republican votes and still pass with the vice president casting the decisive vote in favor. But the Graham-Cassidy legislation had lost at least three Republican votes. By Wednesday, there was no indication that those three senators who were in opposition — Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Arizona Sen. John McCain and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — had been swayed. Collins' announcement on Monday afternoon was seen as the final nail in the coffin for the bill — at least for now. Senate leaders abandoned plans to bring the measure to a vote after Collins went public. Paul, who called Graham-Cassidy ""Obamacare Lite"" in a tweet Friday, said Wednesday he has been working with the White House in an effort to let consumers to buy health care across state lines but gave no indication he had changed his mind on the bill in its current form. ""I think Rand will be there for us,"" Trump said later on Wednesday. ""He's a good guy, and he wants what's good also for the party, so I think Rand will be there."" Paul was clear on Wednesday morning that he's open to negotiating, but that the current Graham-Cassidy proposal wasn't enough to win his vote. ""Nobody really could get their you-know-what together to actually figure out how you get people to come together to get the votes,"" Paul said on Wednesday on MSNBC'S ""Morning Joe"" of Graham-Cassidy. ""It needs more of that."" On Friday, McCain said he could not ""in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal."" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska decline to throw her support to the GOP bill. She released a statement noting that she appreciated her colleagues’ efforts but still did not have a clear picture of how the plan would have affected Alaskans. Trump tweeted Wednesday there were ""good signs"" out of Alaska on health care but those signs weren't immediately clear. When asked Wednesday if Republicans could advance a health care bill next year, she said, ""You know what, I think it needs to be bipartisan.""","Sept. 28, 2017"
Trump says he's open to temporary health care deal with Democrats,3093,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nation's health care system, a key campaign pledge made by Trump and the Republican Party. Republicans fell short several times this year in their drive to repeal former President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a promise the party has campaigned on for seven years. Trump has been frustrated by the failure, openly taunting Republicans as ""total quitters"" and ""fools"" this summer over their inability in the Senate to replace Obamacare. ""If we made a temporary deal, I think it would be a great thing for people, but it's really up to them (Democrats),"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""So if we could do a one-year deal or two-year deal as a temporary measure, you’ll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what Republicans want,"" Trump said. Earlier on Saturday Trump said he had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what he called a ""great"" health care bill to replace Obamacare. ""I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill,"" Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Saturday. ""ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!"" Axios first reported Trump's call to Schumer on Friday. Schumer said Trump had told him during the phone call on Friday that he wanted to try again to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""I told the president that's off the table,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""If he wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions."" Schumer pointed to bipartisan efforts by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray to repair Obamacare as ""a good place to start."" Alexander pulled out of the talks last month as a new Republican bill to repeal Obamacare gained momentum. After that bill collapsed, Alexander said he would again consult with Murray. Although Democrats have been mostly united against Trump's agenda, there is a precedent for a bipartisan deal. Last month, Trump sided with Democrats in a surprising debt limit deal that blindsided Republicans and left conservative groups aghast. But there are still wide policy differences between Democrats and Trump. His administration on Friday undermined requirements under Obamacare that employers provide insurance to cover women's birth control. A new rule will allow businesses or non-profit organizations to lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law's mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. A Democratic aide said the Trump administration would have to abandon such efforts before it could reach a health care deal with Republicans. ""Particularly after the birth control decision yesterday, the administration has to stop sabotaging the law before anything real can happen,"" the aide said on condition of anonymity.","Oct. 8, 2017"

White House 'planning' on health care vote this week,4305,"WASHINGTON — Despite a rushed timetable and the daunting task of pulling together enough votes, the White House is “planning” on the Senate voting on the “Graham-Cassidy” health care bill this week, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said on Sunday’s “Meet The Press.” He claims they are aiming for Wednesday. “There are millions of Americans who will benefit from this bill,” Short said. “In fact, we think every state will benefit.” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who decides when the Senate could address the bill, has said that this week they “intend” to consider the legislation that’s aimed at restructuring the U.S. health care system and repealing some of the signature elements of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But doubts remain over whether he would bring up the bill if it did not have enough support to pass, especially after Republicans’ last attempt at repealing Obamacare suffered a theatrical failure on the floor in July. The White House and Senate Republican leaders believe that Graham-Cassidy is their last shot at dismantling Obamacare this year, since their deadline to pass something without a 60-vote majority is at the end of the month. The bill’s prospects, however, were dealt a major blow on Friday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced that he could not “in good conscience” vote for it. If the legislation loses support from three Republicans, it will not pass, since it does not have the support of any Democrat. Short dodged the question on Sunday when specifically asked which votes were in play. Sen. Lisa Murkowsi, R-Alaska, has not firmly said whether she would support the bill – claiming she wants to see more information about how the legislation could impact the health care markets in her state. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told CNN on Sunday that it is “very difficult” to imagine a scenario where she backs the bill. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has been one of the bill’s fiercest Republican critics, set a bar for his support so high that it’s likely impossible the legislation could meet it. ""This is a bad idea, it’s not repeal,"" Paul said in an exclusive interview on Sunday’s ""Meet The Press."" ""The Graham-Cassidy bill basically keeps most of the Obamacare spending, almost all of the spending, and just reshuffles and block grants it to the states,"" he added. ""So, block granting Obamacare doesn't make it go away. It just means you're keeping all the money we've spending through Obamacare, most of it, reshuffling it, taking the money from Democrat states and giving it to Republican states. I think what it sets up is a perpetual food fight over the formula."" Paul called the suggestion that he opposes the bill because he actually doesn’t want to see major changes to Obamacare — since a number of people from his home state of Kentucky are satisfied with it — a “personal insult” to his character. ""I think most people who follow my position would find that as a physician, there's not been a more consistent voice for repealing Obamacare,"" he said. The senator added that if they could ""remove the block grants"" from the bill, or ""block grant at pre-Obama levels,"" he could vote for it. But those block grants are essential to what’s inside Graham-Cassidy. Graham-Cassidy removes both Obamacare’s mandate that individuals must purchase insurance, as well as the mandate for some employers to offer insurance plans to their employees. It takes funds that would have gone to the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and instead introduces block grants for states to decide how they want their own health insurance systems to work. Short meanwhile on Sunday continued to claim that under Graham-Cassidy, people with pre-existing conditions would be ""protected,"" although in the current version of the bill, that is not as straightforward. The requirements would be loosened compared to what is currently law under the Affordable Care Act. Under Graham-Cassidy’s language, a state must show how it ""intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions"" if it requests a waiver. However, it offers no additional guidance or details on how that would be binding, leaving major questions for coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.","Sept. 24, 2017"
The main objection doctors have to the GOP health plan: Medicaid cuts,6887,"Groups representing pediatricians, cancer specialists, heart doctors and family physicians all agree: Both the House and the Senate offerings for fixing health care in the U.S. would make things worse, not better. Within hours of its release, groups representing medical professionals were denouncing the Senate version, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act or BCRA. ""The Senate draft health care bill is literally heartless,"" American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said. ""Medicine has long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or 'first, do no harm',"" The American Medical Association said in a letter to Senate leaders released Monday. ""The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels."" Here are five reasons so many medical professionals oppose the Republican-proposed changes made so far to the 2010 Affordable Care Act: Women Medicaid covers half the births in the U.S. right now and the House and Senate bills would both not only pull back the expansion of Medicaid that underlay Obamacare, but reduce federal funding for the original program, too. “Medicaid coverage for up to 6.5 million women of childbearing age will be rescinded, making it harder for them to get healthy before they get pregnant,” March of Dimes president Stacey Stewart said. “BCRA discriminates against providers of women’s health services,"" said Dr. Jack Ende, president of the American College of Physicians. The bill cuts funding to women’s health clinics that provide ""contraception, preventive health screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and referrals,"" Ende said. Children Medicaid covers 75 million people, including nearly 36 million children, according to data released Friday by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.. “Senate leaders present their bill as providing states with flexibility. The reality is that it will put considerable pressure on states to limit their spending on health care, including for children,"" said Dr. Matthew Davis, a professor of pediatrics and of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “The bill includes misleading ‘protections’ for children by proposing to exempt them from certain Medicaid cuts,” added Dr. Fernando Stein, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""A ‘carve-out’ for children with ‘medically complex’ health issues does little to protect their coverage when the base program providing the coverage is stripped of its funding. Doing so forces states to chip away coverage in other ways, by not covering children living in poverty who do not have complex health conditions, or by scaling back the benefits that children and their families depend on,” Stein added. “Medicaid allows a college student with cerebral palsy to live independently. Medicaid pays for a toddler’s wheelchair, and as she grows over time, it covers the next one and the one after that.” The poor Medicaid is traditionally the state-federal health plan for the low-income, disabled, and children and cutting it will have repercussions across the health care system as people either wait until they’re at death’s door to get treatment, or head to emergency rooms that by law must save their lives, health policy experts stress. The costs get passed on to taxpayers and people with health insurance. “Medicaid is there for families struggling from the opioid epidemic, covering treatment for parents and services for their children. Medicaid covers a grandmother’s chemotherapy and a newborn baby’s emergency heart surgery and a six-year-old’s hearing screening and a teenager’s asthma inhaler,” Stein said. ""The Senate proposal would likely trigger deep cuts to the Medicaid program that covers millions of Americans with chronic conditions such as cancer, along with the elderly and individuals with disabilities who need long-term services and support. Medicaid cuts of this magnitude are unsustainable and will increase costs to individuals with private insurance,"" added Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association. But Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana says the bills may end up helping people get medical care more easily. ""When folks who are on Medicaid – typically there’s only some doctors that see Medicaid patients,"" Cassidy said on MSNBC's Morning Joe program. ""When they're on private insurance, there’s far – there’s a far broader panel of folks to see. And so if, as we move people to private insurance, they have greater access to doctors, to specialists. That could be a positive thing."" The sick and disabled “Americans with pre-existing conditions will likewise suffer under this proposal because it would give states the ability to discriminate against the sick by obtaining waivers for essential benefits,"" said the Heart Association’s Brown. “States can then create their own essential benefits packages which could exclude prevention benefits, rehabilitation and rehabilitation services — all critical for people with cardiovascular disease.” States may feel pressured to let health insurers cut back on what conditions they will cover. That could mean cheaper premiums, and create the illusion of more choice, but health policy experts say it will mean bare-bones policies in many states that cover very little. “This bill creates a false narrative that says it will help people with pre-existing conditions, but instead it allows states to waive essential health benefits such as vital prescription drugs, mental and behavioral health services, and preventive services,” said Paul Kawata, executive director of the HIV advocacy group NMAC. The elderly Medicaid also covers two-thirds of people in nursing homes. The health care bills in the House and Senate would also let companies charge older people more for insurance than they would younger customers. “We are disappointed that the legislation fails to meet our guiding principles for healthcare reform by halting Medicaid expansion, reinstating annual and lifetime coverage caps, and cutting coverage for essential health benefits including cancer screening,” said Dr. Bruce Johnson, president of the American Society for Clinical Oncology. “We are concerned that no public hearings were held and no physician or patient expertise was sought during the bill's development,” the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Osteopathic Association and American Psychiatric Association said in a joint statement. “The American Health Care Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May, is an inherently flawed bill that would do great harm to our patients. The Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act would also leave patients drastically worse off than current law,"" the statement said.","June 23, 2017"
"US health care: It's officially a mess, institute says",5488,"If banking were like health care, it would take days to get money out of an ATM because the records would be lost. If airlines were like health care, pilots would decide on their own which safety checks to make, if any. If shopping were like health care -- well, you get the picture. It’s a mess, the Institute of Medicine says in a report released on Thursday. The U.S. health care system wasted $750 billion in 2009, about 30 percent of all health spending, on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems. As many as 75,000 people who died in 2005 would have lived if they got the kind of care provided in the states with the best medical systems, the Institute found. The report, issued just as candidates for Congress and for president make health care reform a central part of the national debate, doesn’t pull any punches. The panel of experts assembled by the Institute, an independent body that is supposed to provide a non-partisan last word on important issues, leaves no doubt that U.S. health care now is anything but the best in the world. ""The threats to Americans' health and economic security are clear and compelling, and it's time to get all hands on deck,"" says Mark Smith, president and CEO of the California HealthCare Foundation in Oakland and chairman of the panel. ""Our health care system lags in its ability to adapt, affordably meet patients' needs, and consistently achieve better outcomes."" But there's hope. ""We have the know-how and technology to make substantial improvement on costs and quality. Our report offers the vision and road map to create a learning health care system that will provide higher quality and greater value,"" Smith says. “What I am seeing around the country is that people are absolutely committed to reform,” says James Conway of the Harvard School of Public Health and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Massachusetts, who served on the panel. “Whether you look at the Republican platform or the Democratic platform, you find in pretty strong language the importance of developing a high quality health care system.” One of the biggest problems is that health insurers, hospitals and health systems don’t learn from their mistakes, the report says. Half of all health care professionals still neglect to wash their hands properly before seeing patients, even though it’s one of the main causes of infections that kill tens of thousands of patients every year. An organized system that finds out what went wrong and where, and then provides for the health system to correct those mistakes right away would save money and lives. It’s possible in a computerized world, but it’s not happening on a systematic basis. Hospitals that report every single infection and ruthlessly track down where it came from have found they can cut infection rates to zero, for instance. Yet just this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a third of Americans have high blood pressure and only half of them have it under control. There are dozens of drugs to treat it, not to mention diet and exercise methods. It took 13 years for one of those drug types, the beta-blockers, to become the standard of care even after they had been clearly demonstrated to work, the report says. What’s missing, the report says, is coordination. “What I see is people doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Everyone has their little initiative. And back at the ranch, the doctor, the individual provider, is drowning in the sea of initiatives,” Conway says. “What is missing is a much more systemic and collective response.” The report points to two main problems. “One is the increasingly unmanageable complexity of the science of health care. During the past half-century, there has been an explosion of biomedical and clinical knowledge, with even more dazzling clinical capabilities just over the horizon,” the report says. But the current system doesn’t help providers learn this material and it doesn’t give them any incentive to apply it. “Second is the ever-escalating cost of care, which is widely acknowledged to be wasteful and unsustainable. Unless ways are found to provide more efficient, lower-cost health care, more and more Americans will lose coverage of and access to care.” Conway praises the Massachusetts health care system, which he says is organized with the patient in mind. The report also says government initiatives, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation Center are good ways to test and apply proven treatments and methods for paying for health care. “Until we organize the health care system around the people we are privileged to serve, we aren’t going to figure it out,” Conway said.  “I don’t think we have done that before -- we haven’t organized it around the person with cancer. That would be a remarkable change.” Some ways to get there? Let people see what various treatments cost up front. Employers, who cover the health care costs of 55 percent of Americans, can help, too, the report says. They can use their buying power to demand high-quality, high-value health care, and get their employees involved in wellness programs. So what would happen if shopping were like U.S. health care? ""Product prices would not be posted, and the price charged would vary widely within the same store, depending on the source of payment,” the report says. Related stories:","Sept. 6, 2012"
How to transfer health care responsibility to young adults,10466,"If you’ve been scheduling your child’s annual check-ups or calling the doctor when they’re sick, you’re not alone. As your young adult prepares to leave the house, this is one aspect of post-high school life many families overlook, but with a little planning ahead, you can make the transition go more smoothly. Dr. Bobbi Wegner, a clinical psychologist, says she sees parents who are surprised to notice anxiety as their child takes over their own healthcare. While it can mark a point of separation that can be difficult for some parents, it is an important psychological step in independence and self-care. Here are six items to keep in mind as you hand the reins of physical health over to your teen, and as your role changes from advocate to sounding board. Missouri-based pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert says all teens preparing to take over their own medical care should know the “basics” of their health. They should have a copy of their vaccines, know over-the-counter medications and their uses, know any prescription medications they are on, their past medical history – including any surgeries they may have had. Before they take over their own care, Dr. Burgert also recommends having a conversation about family history. Some conditions can be hereditary or genetic, meaning if someone in the family has a condition it is more likely for other family members to have the same condition. Your teen should also know if they are allergic to any medications. Dr. Burgert recommends having a conversation covering all of these topics that leads to a note or memo your teen can keep in a phone or wallet for reference in the future. Also add to that memo insurance coverage and emergency contact information. This may seem like a basic suggestion, but many young adults haven’t had to access healthcare on their own while living at home. Even if they have, it’s likely they’ve been seeing a pediatrician – a doctor who specializes in care of children. Pediatricians usually end patient care after the age of 18. Missouri-based pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert says she’s no longer surprised when a 20-something calls her office asking where they should go to handle a sore throat. Her experience echoes what researchers found in 2015 that “many young adults face serious challenges in accessing and navigating the healthcare system, with potentially serious repercussions.” While young adults are generally considered a healthy group, there may be emergencies, or non-emergencies, that require medical attention. If your teen is heading off to a four-year university, many campuses have student health centers. Some of these centers even offer low or no-cost care for enrolled students. Before you leave them on campus, you may want to make sure they know where the health center is, and ensure the phone number is programmed in a phone or otherwise accessible place. If your teen is attending a community college or other training program, either you or your teen may want to check with the institution directly. Depending on the college or program they may offer student health centers similar to those found at four-year universities. If your teen doesn’t have a student health center, or if they are staying at home, taking a gap year, or heading into the workforce, you may still want to raise a few questions. Is there a general practitioner that the adults in your family regularly see? That can be one option for your teen if they’re staying nearby. If they’re not staying, is there a friend or family member who could recommend a clinic or doctor in the area your teen is headed? Your teen should also know where the closest emergency room and urgent care centers are. Emergency rooms are usually open all the time, and are only for emergencies, like a car accident or a serious head injury. Urgent care centers are a great option for seeing a doctor in off-hours or when a primary care physician isn’t available. Examples of what constitutes an ER visit versus urgent care visit can be found on New York’s Mount Sinai website here. Regardless of where they’re going, if your teen knows where to find care on their own, it can help ease the stress of trying to track down that information when they are in need of medical attention. In addition to issues in transitioning from pediatricians, young adults’ biggest barriers to receiving medical care are changes in insurance coverage and cost. This means that if you haven’t talked with your teen about insurance, you may want to do so soon. It may also require a bit of research on your end if you are looking to keep your teen on your insurance plan, or if you would be looking for a new plan for them. As of this writing, the Affordable Care Act is still in effect. The law allows children to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26. If your teen won’t be staying on your insurance plan or if you don’t have insurance coverage, there are other options available. For college-bound students, some universities and community colleges offer student health plans directly through the school. Depending on whether your state offers coverage, you can purchase insurance on an exchange, or marketplace, run by your state or plans run by the federal government. For a full list of state marketplaces, use this link. There are also plans available directly from a variety of insurance companies. While it may seem daunting, finding the right option that works for your family could help you save costs, time, and most importantly – stress – in the future. One large change in your teen’s healthcare after high school is your ability to access their records and information. Because an 18-year-old is legally an adult, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 – also known as HIPAA – applies to them. HIPAA aims to protect the personal medical information of patients. What that means for you is that you no longer have access to their medical information. Before your teen moves out, you may want to discuss whether or not they would like to sign a HIPAA waiver and keep it on file at their school health center or with their new primary care physician. The waiver will allow medical professionals to disclose information regarding your teen’s health to you. This can be particularly helpful in emergency situations. Another option would be to have your teen sign a health care power of attorney, also called a healthcare proxy. This allows the person authorized on the document to make medical decisions on your teen’s behalf. While some states have laws that give family members the ability to make decisions for others, you may want to consider this form as well so your family is covered regardless of where your teen resides. This can be especially helpful in emergency situations. You can find free downloadable forms like this one from New York State by searching the internet with “free healthcare proxy form” and your state. If your young adult is still on your insurance plan, it may be important to point out to them that the charges of medical services can show up on the insurance account. So even if they do not choose to share their medical records, the billing process may give you access to sensitive information, such as if they are seeing a therapist or accessing birth control. Dr. Wegner recommends you make sure your teen is aware of this fact. For many families, handling immunizations and medications can often fall to the parents or caregivers. But just like knowing where to go or who to call if they get sick, your teen should also be able to take over their own medical regiment. These two items can be easily overlooked in the transition out of the house, but are still important. Before your teen leaves their pediatrician, discuss immunizations they may still need. The pediatrician should be able to give you insights into what shots your teen has already had, and what will be coming up. The MenACWY vaccine can help prevent bacterial meningitis, which your college-bound student may consider getting. Additionally, many college campus housing rules require students to have certain vaccines before moving in. Your teen should check the rules of their housing and make sure they have all the required vaccines. The HPV and seasonal flu vaccine are also shots your teen may want to discuss with their doctor. If your teen is on any over-the-counter or prescription medications, make sure they know the doses and frequency they should take the medication. Some teens may forget to take medications once you’re no longer there to remind them. Depending on the medication, this can have adverse reactions. Having a conversation or reminder email about the doses and medications can serve as a gentle reminder to your teen that their health is in their hands now. As the parent, it can be difficult to tackle this subject, but if you haven’t talked with your teen about this before, it doesn’t have to be as awkward as you might think. Having a sexual partner is likely for many young adults. From a straight physical health perspective, there are certain considerations to make. Will they need birth control? Do they know to use protection? Do they know to get annual STD screenings? If you’re uncomfortable having those discussions, or your family believes in practicing abstinence, simply ensuring your teen knows where to access healthcare can point them in the right direction. Many student health centers have sexual health clinics and many large communities have free or low-cost screening centers. Both of those options can offer inexpensive or even free contraception. Then there are similarly important conversations to have around consent. While this may be a discussion you’ve had previously with your teen, it is worth bringing up again as they leave the house. Keep in mind that talking about consent is not just a conversation for males or females. Does your teen know how to ask for, and give, consent? Do they know to confirm consent verbally? Do they know how to speak up if they feel uncomfortable at any point in the encounter? There are a lot of factors to consider, and though it may be difficult to talk about, your guidance is extremely valuable.
