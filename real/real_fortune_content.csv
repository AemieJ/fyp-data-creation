"Walgreens’ COVID-19 testing website left data unprotected, according to report",3074,"The personal information of potentially millions of Walgreens customers could be vulnerable, say security experts. According to reporting from Recode, the nation’s largest pharmacy failed to protect the personal data of customers who got a COVID-19 test at one of its locations nationwide—and that could make information including names, dates of birth, gender identities, phone numbers, addresses, and emails available to everyone from hackers to ad trackers. A spokesperson for Walgreens disputed the report, providing the following statement: “Protecting personal information of our customers and patients is always one of our highest priorities, which we take very seriously.  We have implemented a strong security program to protect our patient data. This article is not an accurate assessment of our security protections in place on our Covid-19 testing website."" The issues center around Walgreens’ COVID test registration system, which customers must use if they wish to be tested. Once patient information is entered, the system generates a 32-digit ID number associated with the patient. That ID number is included in the appointment request page—and anyone with the URL can access the page. Those pages remain active for at least six months, Recode reports. While the appointment pages themselves don’t list all of the personal information patients enter, that information is accessible via a browser’s developer tools panel. Also accessible is the name of the lab that performed the test, which could help others discover the results of your test. The pages are also loaded with ad tracking software, which could allow companies ranging from Akamai to Facebook to Google access to the information. A determined hacker could write a bot that could guess many of those ID numbers, scraping the information and using it to potentially hack other accounts or steal the patient’s identity. Experts note that randomly guessing a number, though, would be extremely challenging.

""Statistically, the probability of being able to access a patient record by randomly guessing equates to one in multiple trillions, since the system randomly generates a unique, 32-digit hexadecimal URL link,"" said a Walgreens spokesperson in a statement. ""We have multiple layers of security to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to Covid testing data. We are not aware of any credible evidence of unauthorized access to patient data. We work with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to ensure that appropriate security is in place which regularly evolves to respond to changing threats. During the Covid-19 pandemic, our stores and pharmacies have provided safe, reliable testing to our communities across America.“ Walgreens has been a hub for COVID testing and vaccine dispersal. Barclays predicts the chain will administer about 12.5% of all U.S. vaccines. And that has presented the company with an opportunity to win over customers to its retail business, as well as future ventures.

Update, September 14, 2021: This article has been updated with a comment from Walgreens. "

School vaccination drives face backlash from some parents and local officials,6366,"Fearing his parents wouldn’t approve of his decision to get a COVID-19 vaccine but needing their signature, Andrew signed up for the appointment in secret, and then sprang it on them at the last minute. They said no. Andrew cursed at his mother and father and called them idiots. Andrew’s dad grabbed him by the shirt collar. “He said, ‘You’re not getting this damn vaccine; you need to lower your voice. Watch your tone when you talk to me.’ It was, it was the first time my dad had ever done something like that—he grabbed my shirt and yelled in my face,” said Andrew, a 17-year-old student in Hoover, Alabama. In most states, minors need the consent of their parents in order to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Navigating family politics in cases of differing views has been a challenge for students and organizers of outreach campaigns, who have faced blowback for directly targeting young people. President Joe Biden has encouraged every school district to promote vaccines, including with on-site clinics, to protect students as they return to school amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. But several governments and school districts have taken more neutral stances in areas where skepticism of the vaccine remains prevalent. In Tennessee, the health department ended vaccination events and outreach aimed at minors following criticism of advertisements that featured children and included slogans like “Give COVID-19 vaccines a shot.” Republican lawmakers accused the health department of “peer pressuring” children to get the vaccine and criticized a top official who sent a memo to vaccine providers explaining that they could legally waive parental consent under Tennessee law. Nationwide, half of people ages 12-17 have been vaccinated. That age group has been eligible for the Pfizer vaccine since May on an emergency use authorization. Trials are underway for younger children. Full approval for the drug was granted by federal safety regulators recently for people 16 and older. Last week, the Los Angeles Unified School District school board voted to mandate vaccines for students 12 and older. In Molalla, Oregon, the mayor pressured a high school to cancel a vaccine drive on campus this semester, citing a $50 gift card incentive he equated with bribery. Many who called for an end to the vaccine drive expressed opposition to the vaccines, although Mayor Scott Keyser said he’s not against them. Misinformation surrounding in-school vaccination efforts has also eroded trust between parents and school districts across the country. School officials in Kettering, Ohio, received death threats in August after TikTok videos baselessly claimed the suburban Dayton district was vaccinating children without parental consent. There was no truth to the claims—they came out before the school year began, and spring vaccine clinics required parents to be present—but they caused “huge hysteria” in the community nonetheless, according to Kettering City Schools superintendent Scott Inskeep. “Our families really are struggling with both information and disinformation,” Inskeep said. “It’s like a match being put to a gasoline fire. When it starts it’s hard to put out.” In a total of eight states, all in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, providers can waive parental consent requirements—Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama, according to a May review by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In some areas, there have been efforts to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated. State legislators in New York and New Jersey introduced laws that would allow teens to consent to vaccines without parental consent, but they were never passed. D.C. passed its law and is being sued by an anti-vaccine group. In New Mexico, health officials remade consent forms so that parents could sign them and send them with their kids, instead of having to show up in person. Elsewhere, some officials have tried to give parents more say over vaccinations for teenagers. In May, officials in two Oregon counties barred health officials from giving vaccines to kids without parental consent. Yamhill County Commissioner Lindsay Berschauer and the mother of three teenagers defended the move saying, “Our children are not the property of the State of Oregon.” But the counties backed down after state health officials issued a legal opinion affirming consent rights for children 15 and older. Berschauer continues to advocate against vaccine incentives for teens, calling the programs “peer pressure.” On paper, Alabama’s law is one of the more liberal, allowing minors like Andrew to get the vaccine on their own. In practice, that’s nearly impossible. The Alabama Department of Public Health requires parental consent as a matter of policy, and so do major pharmacies. The day after the argument with his parents, Andrew’s father took him to the pharmacy and signed, without saying a word. Andrew’s father confirmed his son's account but declined to be interviewed. Andrew asked that his last name not be used out of fear of further upsetting his parents. Pediatricians in some cases try to facilitate conversations between children and parents and promote the COVID-19 vaccine. But it doesn't always work, even with parents who have accepted their pediatrician's recommendation on other vaccines, including for HPV and the flu. “They look at me like I’m suggesting that they feed their childhood poison when I’m recommending a COVID vaccine,” said doctor Katrina Skinner, President of the Alabama Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Andrew's Hoover High School does not promote COVID-19 vaccinations on its website or social media channels, and there’s no indication the school will host a vaccine clinic. School officials did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. Alabama state health officials have been encouraging the vaccines among young people with a contest on the social media app TikTok that awarded $250 for the best video promoting COVID-19 vaccinations. One of Andrew's schoolmates, Rotimi Kukoyi, 17, was one of four contest winners. He shared the video with his 18,000 followers, built over two years by making jokes. “I showed the CDC explaining how the vaccine is safe, and how it’s effective, and then I linked resources for people to sign up to get the vaccine,” Rotimi said."
"As workers stay at home due to COVID, downtown businesses adjust to a new reality",7261,"Downtown businesses in the U.S. and abroad once took for granted that nearby offices would provide a steady clientele looking for breakfast, lunch, everyday goods and services and last-minute gifts. As the resilient coronavirus keeps offices closed and workers at home, some are adapting while others are trying to hang on. Some businesses are already gone. The survivors have taken steps such as boosting online sales or changing their hours, staffing levels and what they offer customers. Others are relying more on residential traffic. Many business owners had looked forward to a return toward normalcy this month as offices reopened. But now that many companies have postponed plans to bring workers back, due to surging COVID-19 cases, downtown businesses are reckoning with the fact that adjustments made on the fly may become permanent. In downtown Detroit, Mike Frank’s cleaning business was running out of money and, it seemed, out of time. Frank started Clifford Street Cleaners eight years ago. Pre-pandemic, monthly revenue was about $11,000, but by last December, when many downtown offices had to close, revenue had dropped to $1,800, Frank said. Frank had to borrow money from his wife to pay the bills. “It got down to, I was almost ready to go out of business.” Instead of shutting down, Frank adapted. He converted part of his store into a small market with toothpaste, laundry detergent, shampoo, bottled water, soft drinks and other essentials. He also delivered clean laundry and goods from the store. Eventually, some foot traffic returned. With the combination of retail sales and dry cleaning, revenue is back up to about $4,100 per month, he said. That’s enough to keep him afloat, and the figure is improving each month. In Lower Manhattan, 224 businesses closed their doors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York. About 100 have opened. “There’s no question, it’s hard for business districts like ours, we miss our workers,” said Jessica Lappin, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. “Nobody misses them more than local businesses.” Lappin predicts office workers will come back, but it might be two or three days a week, on different days or in shifts. “Just in the way we had to adjust so dramatically to being at home all the time, there is an adjustment to coming back,” she said. A block from Wall Street, Blue Park Kitchen used to have lines out the door each weekday as office workers waited to buy one of the grain bowls Kelly Fitzpatrick served as a healthy lunch option. “Things are completely different,” she said. Online orders now account for 65% of the business—although they are less profitable because the online apps take a cut. Higher-margin catering orders remain non-existent and Blue Park has reduced its staff by nine workers. “At our peak in July 2021 (before the Delta variant surge), we had about 65% of peak pre-COVID business,” Fitzpatrick said. Fitzpatrick has seen more offices reopen and hopes more companies return in October, before the slower holiday months of November and December. Nearby, Aankit Malhotra took over Indian restaurant Benares with his brother in 2019. When the pandemic hit, overnight, their core banking clientele vanished. No one came in for the $13 three-course lunch special the restaurant was known for. Previously, lunch accounted for 95% of Benares’ business. Now, Benares has about 10 lunch orders a day, down from 100. But locals, grateful that the restaurant kept its pre-pandemic hours of 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day, are keeping the brothers afloat. Business is back to around 70% of pre-pandemic levels, helped by delivery and dinner meals. The clientele has changed from workers to younger people and families from nearby Battery Park City. “It’s nice to see not just corporate people downtown. It’s becoming more of a family-oriented place.” Jorge Guzman, assistant professor of business management at Columbia University, said the shift of economic activity away from downtowns is likely to last. There has been a boom in entrepreneurship in non-downtown New York areas like Jamaica, Queens, and the South Bronx. “Downtowns are not going to die, exactly. It’s not like Midtown’s going anywhere. But it’s going to be a little bit more of a mix, more residential and mixed-use concepts.” Across the Atlantic in London, office workers have been slowly trickling back to their desks since the government lifted COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on July 19. The U.K. saw a peak of Delta cases in July, but the numbers fell sharply in about two weeks. Recently, however, cases have been climbing again. The number of commuters is nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, making it tough for small businesses in Central London’s financial district to survive. “It was amazing, it was good, it was busy before the pandemic,” said Rado Asatrian, who has worked as a barber at the Man-oj hair salon in the financial district for six years. Before COVID-19 , he usually had 10 to 15 customers a day, but now it’s down to three or four. “Now, it’s just so empty,” said Asatrian. He said he is considering moving to a busier location, switching careers, or moving abroad. In some downtowns, while the workers are still remote, the tourists are back and providing a boost to businesses. In Atlanta, Kwan’s Deli and Korean Food is doing just about as much summertime business as it did before the pandemic, said Andrew Song, whose family owns the restaurant. At the height of the pandemic, Kwan’s had lost about 80% of its business, reduced its hours and cut staff. But the deli has bounced back thanks to tourists from the Georgia Aquarium and events at a nearby convention hall. Still, the Delta variant surge is creating uncertainty about the fall. Song said he has heard that some businesses have relocated permanently or downsized. “It’s sort of hard to imagine what it will look like with office regulars not returning or being more remote,” he said. In Nashville, Lyle Richardson, chief operating officer for restaurant operator A. Marshall Hospitality, said he has seen the city’s restaurant industry ravaged by the coronavirus epidemic. He sits on the board of the Tennessee Hospitality Association trade group and estimates that hundreds of restaurants have had to close. Those who stayed open made adjustments. Richardson stopped serving lunch at one restaurant, Deacon’s New South, to focus on dinner after office workers went remote. But he kept his other restaurant, Puckett’s Grocery & Restaurant, open from 7 a.m to 11 p.m. to attract the tourists flocking back to the city. “The normalcy we called pre-COVID, that no longer exists,” he said. “We have to be prepared, on our toes, to adapt.” Back in Detroit, business at Cannelle by Matt Knio, a downtown bakery and sandwich shop, has rebounded above 2019 levels after a precipitous drop-off early in the pandemic. Baseball and football crowds are back, and outdoor dining and takeout remain popular. If businesses are subject to more restrictions when the weather gets colder, Knio believes he can rely on the lessons learned so far in the pandemic to get by. “I think we know our way around now, and how to deal with it,” he said. “We’ll be able to do takeout and curbside pickup.”"
"Most people don’t need COVID vaccine boosters yet, scientists say",2789,"COVID-19 vaccines work so well that most people don’t yet need a booster, an all-star panel of scientists from around the world said in a review that’s likely to fuel the debate over whether to use them.  Governments would be better served to focus on immunizing the unvaccinated and to wait for more data on which boosters, and at what doses, would be most effective, the authors, who included two prominent U.S. Food and Drug Administration experts, argued in the medical journal The Lancet. They based their assessment on a wide range of real-world observational studies as well as data from clinical trials before the vaccines were approved. “None of the studies has provided credible evidence of substantially declining protection against severe disease,” the authors wrote. There could also be additional side-effect risks if boosters are introduced too soon or too broadly, they said.  The review comes as most countries with ample vaccine supplies debate whether to allocate doses for booster shots to prop up immunity and potentially help stop the spread of the more infectious Delta variant. The U.S. plans to roll out booster shots starting Sept. 20, though the plan still needs sign-off from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among the scientists behind the conclusions were Marion Gruber, who leads the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, and her deputy Philip Krause. Both have said they would step down later this year. Gruber and Krause were two of a group of FDA staff who last year pushed back against pressure by the Trump administration to speed up the authorization of the COVID vaccines, according to a person familiar with the matter. The World Health Organization’s Soumya Swaminathan, Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo and Mike Ryan also worked on the review. The WHO has pushed against broad use of boosters, saying it would make better public-health sense to focus on immunizing those who haven’t gotten any shots yet—whether because of anti-vaccine sentiment in countries with ample reserves, or because they live in places with little access to shots.  “Even if boosting were eventually shown to decrease the medium-term risk of serious disease, current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations,” the authors wrote.  Across the observational studies done so far, vaccination has been an average of 95% effective against severe disease, including against more infectious variants such as Delta, and more than 80% effective at preventing any infection, the review found. Even in countries with high vaccination rates, it’s unvaccinated people that are driving transmission of the virus—and who are at highest risk of becoming very ill, the study found. —With assistance from Drew Armstrong."

The U.K. terminates its COVID vaccine contract with Valneva—wiping out almost half its market cap,2431,"The U.K. government has canceled its order of 100 million doses of the late-stage COVID-19 vaccine from France-based biotech firm Valneva—leading company shares to plummet by 45%. The U.K. government said it had terminated the contract because Valneva was in breach of its obligations under the deal—a claim Valneva “strenuously” denies. The deal was worth up to €1.4 billion ($1.65 billion) with the vaccine set to be manufactured in Scotland. Deliveries were expected to start in 2022. Shares in Valneva fell more than 40% in early Paris trading, hitting a low of €11 before recouping some of the losses. The Valneva vaccine differentiates itself from the vaccines currently on the market by stimulating a reaction to the inactivated whole COVID-19 virus, rather than just targeting the spike protein, a process that some scientists say should offer protection against more variants.  This old-school vaccine design of taking a killed sample of the disease and using it to stimulate an immune response means the Valneva shot could complement existing vaccines and be used as a booster shot—an attractive feature that has helped Valvena quadruple its stock price over the past year. It is not clear what pushed the U.K. government to serve a notice of termination, but in previous warnings, Valneva warned of a “substantial risk” to exporting the vaccine between the EU and the U.K. owing to supply chain issues. The vaccine is currently still in late-stage trials with the results expected in the fourth quarter of this year. The laboratory noted at the end of August that based on Phase I and Phase II trials, it hoped to have a vaccine that is more than 80% effective. U.K. approval is slated for late next year. “Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG’s requests for variant-derived vaccines,” the company said in a statement. Back in April, talks between Valneva and the European Commission also broke down because, the EU executive said, the company failed to meet “a certain set of conditions.” Valneva’s prioritization of the U.K.’s order was reportedly a factor. There was a subsequent resurrection of the talks in late June, suggesting the EU no longer saw this as an obstacle, but Valneva never secured an EU purchase agreement. It has been negotiating vaccine contracts on a country-by-country basis."
Southeast Asian countries realize they can no longer afford their strict COVID control measures,5705,"Even as they struggle with one of the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreaks, nations across Southeast Asia are slowly realizing that they can no longer afford the economy-crippling restrictions needed to squash it. On the factory floors of Vietnam and Malaysia, in the barbershops of Manila or office towers of Singapore, regulators are pushing forward with plans to reopen, seeking to balance containing the virus with keeping people and money moving. That’s leading to a range of experiments including military-delivered food, sequestered workers, micro-lockdowns and vaccinated-only access to restaurants and offices. In contrast to Europe and the U.S., which have already moved down the reopening path, the region’s low vaccination rates leave it among the world’s most vulnerable to the delta variant. But with state finances stretched by previous rounds of stimulus and dwindling monetary policy firepower, lockdowns are becoming less tenable by the day.   “It’s a tricky balance between lives and livelihoods,” said Krystal Tan, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. economist, noting that even Singapore has struggled with infection spikes despite having a world-leading vaccination rate. The risks of stop-start re-openings are higher in the rest of the region, where coverage is considerably lower, Tan said. Southeast Asia’s factory shutdowns have rippled across the world to create supply chain hiccups, with automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. slashing production and clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. warning the situation is “out of control.” The daily death rate in many Southeast Asian countries has surpassed the global average, helping push them to bottom spots of the Bloomberg’s COVID Resilience Ranking.  Yet officials are increasingly worried about what it means economically if restrictions linger too long despite slow inoculations. Malaysia cut its 2021 growth forecast in half to 3%-4% as daily cases hit records. Thailand’s hoped-for rebound on a critical tourism revival is swiftly vanishing.  Even where the outlook appears impressive—Vietnam is set to grow 6% this year and Singapore officials see theirs as high as 7%—there’s increasing pressure to address global supply-chain blockages and to avoid dampening foreign investor appetite for the dynamic region. According to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. economist Wellian Wiranto, Southeast Asian nations are being worn down both by the economic costs from successive rounds of lockdowns and an increasing sense of exhaustion among their populations as the crisis drags on. “Any hope of a broad border reopening that can facilitate trade and tourism flow across various Asean countries is going to remain a distant pipe dream,” Wiranto said. When it comes to impacts on global supply chains, the stakes have been among the highest in Vietnam, where increasingly stringent lockdowns have exacted a high cost for manufacturers and exporters while failing to halt delta’s spread. The country’s trade ministry warned this month that it risks losing overseas customers because of tough restrictions that have shuttered factories. The European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam estimated that 18% of its members have relocated part of their production to other countries to ensure their supply chains are protected, with more expected to follow.  Patience among the public is wearing thin across the region, especially as they’ve battled the virus for longer than most of the world. In Malaysia, the social angst helped force regime change after extended lockdowns fueled job losses but failed to reduce cases. Street protests against the Thai government that predate COVID have evolved into pandemic-related rallies. The plight of the working poor in Vietnam—away from promising middle-class jobs for multinational companies—is increasing pressure on the government to re-open. In Singapore and the Philippines, businesses are becoming more vocal about difficulties in long-term planning due to the lack of certainty around government policies. As a result, there is now a growing shift in Southeast Asia to treat COVID-19 as endemic, with the likes of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand emulating Singapore’s strategy to learn to “live with the virus.” Indonesia, the region’s biggest economy, is focused on the long game. Ministers are attempting to cement rules like a years-long mask mandate rather than implementing on-and-off mobility curbs. They’re also rolling out “road maps” for specific areas like offices and schools in order to outline more permanent rules in the new normal. Reporting the number of daily cases is now becoming less important than their severity. This is especially true for the two most-vaccinated in Southeast Asia—Singapore, which ranks among the world’s best above 80%, and Malaysia, with about half the population fully inoculated. In place of national or regional lockdowns, the Philippines is looking to apply mobility curbs in more targeted zones—down to the street or even house. Vietnam, too, is testing this strategy, with Hanoi instituting travel checkpoints as officials vary restrictions based on virus risk in different areas of the city. Only those with vaccine cards can enter malls and places of worship in Jakarta, or head to the cinemas in Malaysia. Restaurants in Singapore are required to check the vacciation status of diners. In Manila, officials are considering “vaccine bubbles” for workplaces and public transport. While this strategy may reduce the damage to the broader economy, the risk is that an unequal distribution of vaccines—in Malaysia, for instance, to economically vital states rather than poorer areas—may unfairly disadvantage lower-income residents. "
"Prepare for a rough few months of COVID-19, according to these scientists",8691,"For anyone hoping to see light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel over the next three to six months, scientists have some bad news: Brace for more of what we’ve already been through.  Outbreaks will close schools and cancel classes. Vaccinated nursing home residents will face renewed fears of infection. Workers will weigh the danger of returning to the office as hospitals are overwhelmed, once again. Almost everyone will be either infected or vaccinated before the pandemic ends, experts agree. Maybe both. An unlucky few will contract the virus more than once. The race between the waves of transmission that lead to new variants and the battle to get the globe inoculated won’t be over until the coronavirus has touched all of us.  “I see these continued surges occurring throughout the world,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and an adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden. “Then it will drop, potentially somewhat precipitously,” he said. “And then I think we very easily could see another surge in the fall and winter” of this year, he added.  With billions of people around the world yet to be vaccinated and little chance now of eliminating the virus, we can expect more outbreaks in classrooms, on public transport and in workplaces over the coming months, as economies push ahead with reopening. Even as immunization rates rise, there will always be people who are vulnerable to the virus: Newborn babies, people who can’t or won’t get inoculated, and those who get vaccinated but suffer breakthrough infections as their protection levels ebb.  The next few months will be rough. One key danger is if a vaccine-resistant variant develops, although it is not the only risk ahead. In the coming months, Bloomberg will explore the pandemic’s long-term impact on economies and markets, the pharmaceutical industry, travel and more. “We’re going to see hills and valleys, at least for the next several years as we get more vaccine out. That’s going to help. But the challenge is going to be: How big will the hills and valleys be, in terms of their distance?” Osterholm said. “We don’t know. But I can just tell you, this is a coronavirus forest fire that will not stop until it finds all the human wood that it can burn.” The five well-documented influenza pandemics of the past 130 years offer some blueprint for how COVID might play out, according to Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist and professor of population health sciences at Roskilde University in Denmark. She is an expert on the ebb and flow of such events. While the longest global flu outbreak lasted five years, they mostly consisted of two to four waves of infection over an average of two or three years, she said. COVID is already shaping up to be among the more severe pandemics, as its second year concludes with the world in the middle of a third wave—and no end in sight.  It’s possible that the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 won’t follow the path set by the pandemics of the past. After all, it is a different, novel and potentially more transmissible pathogen. And with a death toll of more than 4.6 million people so far, it’s already more than twice as deadly as any outbreak since the 1918 Spanish flu. Despite brutal initial waves and relatively high vaccination rates, countries including the U.S., U.K., Russia and Israel are flirting with record numbers of cases. Immunization is helping to moderate incidences of severe cases and deaths, but surging infections mean the virus is reaching the young and others who remain unvaccinated, leading to rising rates of serious disease in those groups. Nations where vaccination has been sparse—including Malaysia, Mexico, Iran and Australia—are in the midst of their biggest outbreaks yet, fueled by the contagious delta strain. With the virus still spreading out of control in vast swathes of the planet, another novel variant could quite feasibly emerge. History shows the commonly held belief that viruses automatically get milder over time—to avoid completely wiping out their host population—is wrong, according to Simonsen. Although new mutations aren’t always more severe than their predecessors, “pandemics can in fact get more deadly during the pandemic period, as the virus is adapting to its new host,” she said. Early in the COVID outbreak, there was good reason to hope that vaccines would provide long-term protection, much like childhood shots that stop diseases such as polio.  Coronaviruses have a “proof-reading” mechanism that fixes the in-born errors caused when the virus replicates, reducing the likelihood of variants emerging when the virus is transmitted from one person to another.  The number of global cases has been so vast, however, that mutations are occurring anyway. “With the pandemic, we have this enormous force of infection,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. “That has counterbalanced the ability of the virus to proof-read.” As a result, COVID could be like the flu, requiring regular vaccine top-ups to remain effective as the virus evolves.  Some researchers say SARS-CoV-2 is poised to become completely resistant to the first generation of vaccines. A study from Japan, which has yet to be published or peer-reviewed, suggests that potentially dangerous mutations in the delta variant are already being picked up in a global database used to track such developments. Reports of current strains breaking through vaccinations or triggering higher fatality rates have not held up to rigorous scrutiny thus far. “This is a scenario we hope won’t happen,” Simonsen said. “My God, we would have to do it all again.” Other even grimmer possibilities for the coming months include the emergence of a novel influenza virus or another coronavirus making the leap from animals into humans. “As long as there are animal reservoirs of coronavirus there is still the possibility that another zoonotic coronavirus could emerge in the future,” Subbarao said. “There is that in the background, the risk of still dealing with this one when another one emerges.” What seems clear is that the pandemic will not be over in six months. Experts generally agree that the current outbreak will be tamed once most people—perhaps 90% to 95% of the global population—have a degree of immunity thanks to immunization or previous infection.  The key element should be vaccination, they say. “Without vaccination, one is like a sitting duck, because the virus will spread widely and find most everybody this autumn and winter,” said Simonsen.  More than 5.66 billion doses of vaccine have been administered around the world, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. But the success of rollouts in some regions, such as the European Union, North America and China, masks the failure in others. Most countries in Africa have only given enough vaccine to cover less than 5% of their populations with a two-dose shot. India has administered enough to cover only about 26%.  The pandemic will end at different times in different places, just as previous outbreaks have, said Erica Charters, associate professor of the history of medicine at Oxford University and the coordinator of a project on how epidemics end. Governments will have to decide how much of the disease they are comfortable living with, she said. Approaches vary. While some countries are still shooting for zero COVID cases, the world is unlikely to eradicate the virus completely. Nations like Denmark and Singapore, which have managed to keep cases relatively contained, are already moving toward a post-pandemic future with fewer safety restrictions. Others, such as the U.S. and U.K., are opening up even as infection numbers near records. Meanwhile, China, Hong Kong and New Zealand have vowed to keep vigilantly working to eliminate the virus locally. As a result, they are likely to be among the last places to leave behind the disruption wrought by walling out the pandemic. “The end process is not going to be uniform,” Charters said. The pandemic “is a biological phenomenon, but it’s also a political and social phenomenon.”  “Even now we have different approaches to it.”  It’s likely to be messy, leaving a lasting legacy for years to come. Until then, most of us will need to brace for many more months in the pandemic’s grip.  “We have to approach it with our eyes wide open and with a great deal of humility,” Osterholm said. “Anybody that thinks we're going to be over this in the next few days or a few months is sorely mistaken.”"
Delta used this ‘negative incentive’ strategy to get employees vaccinated,664,"Delta found a novel way to fight Delta. At a briefing Thursday sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, SVP and chief health officer at Delta Air Lines Dr. Henry Ting spoke about the company’s approach to encouraging employees to get vaccinated. He described Delta’s multipronged approach as “a marathon.” And while President Joe Biden’s rules for large employers are set to go into effect in the coming weeks, mandating either vaccinations or weekly testing for some 80 million private sector workers, employers may want to take a page from Delta’s book when it comes to nudging, educating, and ultimately persuading their workers to get on board."
The FDA is rapidly reviewing COVID vaccines for children under 12,1905,"COVID-19 vaccines for younger children will be vetted as quickly as possible once drugmakers seek authorization for them, U.S. regulators said, vowing a swift review amid concern about the infection risks faced by kids. Currently, Americans 12 and older are eligible to receive a vaccine. But the recent surge in infections fueled by the Delta variant and the start of a new school year have increased calls for younger children to be immunized. The Food and Drug Administration is “prepared to complete its review as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months,” Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Peter Marks, the director of the agency’s Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation, said in a statement on Friday. “We know there have been questions and public commentary on the process surrounding vaccines for young children, so we think it’s important to share information about the process and the necessary considerations involved to provide greater clarity to the public about this effort,” the officials said. To date, none of the three companies whose vaccines have been cleared in the U.S. have sought authorization for their use in younger kids. Regulators’ ability to rapidly assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for those under age 12 will depend on “the quality and timeliness of the submissions from manufacturers,” Woodcock and Marks said.   President Joe Biden said in a speech at the White House Thursday outlining new measures to curb the pandemic that the government would balance the need to carefully vet a vaccine against the urgent situation created by the recent outbreak. “We can’t take shortcuts with that scientific work, but I’ve made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible,” he said."
"Its COVID-19 vaccine bogged down in trials, Sanofi to manufacture BioNTech/Pfizer doses",3207,"The French biopharma giant Sanofi still doesn't have a COVID-19 vaccine to offer the world, so it's making other companies’ vaccines instead. Late Thursday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of Sanofi's manufacturing site in Frankfurt for the production of BioNTech/Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine. This, and another newly approved German site, operated by Siegfried Hameln, will together pump out an extra 50 million Comirnaty doses over the remainder of this year. Sanofi's deal with Germany's BioNTech was announced back in January, a month after Sanofi and its development partner GSK announced the failure of their vaccine candidate to generate a sufficient immune response in older people. At the time, Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson insisted his company's own development efforts would continue, but he said the pharma industry had a ""collective goal of putting all the effort in to curb this pandemic."" ""We are very conscious that the earlier vaccine doses are available, the more lives can potentially be saved,"" Hudson said in January. The following month, Sanofi revealed a similar production arrangement for J&J's vaccine in France, and in April Sanofi struck another deal to make Moderna's vaccine in the U.S. Sanofi's BioNTech deal should cover the production of over 125 million doses in total. The Moderna deal—production is scheduled to start this month—covers up to 200 million doses, and Sanofi should be making 12 million J&J doses a month once the EMA clears that arrangement (the agency said Friday that it had nothing to share on that front). Of course, Europe's vaccine landscape is very different now from how it was earlier this year, when the BioNTech and J&J deals were announced. Back then, supply was a problem. Now Europe has more doses than it needs, and debate is raging over rich countries' failure to share enough of their surplus with poorer countries that have managed to vaccinate far fewer of their citizens. Sanofi and GSK still hope to gain regulatory approval for their two-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate toward the end of this year. They kicked off a fresh Phase III trial in May, soon after Hudson suggested their potential jab could be used to address new coronavirus variants or deployed as booster shots. The Sanofi/GSK candidate is an adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine that is based on Sanofi's existing flu vaccine. Sanofi has also been working with Translate Bio on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate (and a separate jab for seasonal flu) that uses mRNA technology, of the sort that underpins BioNTech/Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines. Initial results are expected later this month for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Last month, Sanofi said it would buy Translate Bio for $3.2 billion. ""Our goal is to unlock the potential of mRNA in other strategic areas such as immunology, oncology, and rare diseases in addition to vaccines,"" said Hudson when the purchase was announced. Sanofi and BioNTech have quite a long-standing relationship that began with a cancer immunotherapy-focused research collaboration deal in 2015. At the start of 2019, Sanofi invested €80 million ($94.5 million) in BioNTech as their joint work moved into clinical testing."
India’s Kerala state was a COVID-19 success story. Now the ‘Kerala model’ appears to be faltering,7095,"When the first wave of COVID-19 struck India in 2020, the southern state of Kerala emerged as a unique success story in battling the virus. Local authorities promoted the “Kerala model” as a blueprint to contain COVID-19 outbreaks across the country. But now the palm-fringed state of 35 million people has become India’s epicenter for COVID-19 cases. On Thursday, Kerala accounted for 30,193 of the 46,263 infections recorded in India, making up 65% of India’s total caseload. The spike in Kerala comes as India’s total daily COVID cases have plunged from a peak of over 400,000 in the first week of May to around 40,000 cases per day this week. The Kerala model, which emphasized early mask-wearing and social distancing and was vaunted by local authorities and newspapers last year, isn’t preventing infections as it once did. Health experts say the state may be especially vulnerable to the virus since—unlike other regions—a high share of its population has not yet developed immunity from a COVID-19 infection. Still, the spiraling outbreak also suggests that Kerala’s COVID-19 response may not be as effective as once thought, especially as concerns grow that the state’s high caseload could spill over and trigger another deadly wave of infections across the country.  Since at least the 1970s, politicians and economists have admired the state of Kerala for its relatively high quality of life indicators despite its low income. Economists have long attributed the state’s success to early investments in health and education, its ability to redistribute income, and high voting rates among citizens. Today, Kerala continues to punch above its weight, with the highest literacy rate and life expectancy in the country despite having only the ninth-highest GDP among India’s 28 states. Early in the pandemic, the state pioneered its own response to battle COVID-19, which is now known as the Kerala model.  On Jan. 30, 2020, Kerala recorded India’s first case of COVID-19. Infections began to rise in Kerala and across the country through February and March, but Kerala’s government took a more proactive approach in combating the virus than other states. Kerala closed schools and banned mass gatherings weeks before the central government followed suit, and it deployed thousands of health workers to test, trace, and isolate people who might have been exposed to the virus. Kerala went into complete lockdown days before the central government announced a nationwide lockdown at the end of March. Kerala’s success carried over to the wave of devastating, Delta variant–driven infections that swept the rest of India this spring and summer.  In late April, as COVID-19 overwhelmed large parts of the country, Kerala staved off the worst of the crisis. At the height of India’s outbreak in April and May, Kerala’s case fatality ratio, which tracks how many people die after getting COVID-19, was 0.5%, lower than the national average of 1.3%. Kerala’s model of widespread mask-wearing, social-distancing, and testing and contact-tracing appeared to be working. “Unlike other states, the health care system in Kerala was never overwhelmed, and the state always had surplus hospital beds and [supplemental] oxygen,” says Jacob John, a virologist now retired from Christian Medical College. Health experts blame the ongoing resurgence of COVID in Kerala on several factors. First, Kerala may have simply let down its guard. Infections began to rise during the 10-day religious festival of Onam, held between Aug. 12 and 23. People mingled with one another, even though the state had banned large group gatherings ahead of the holiday.  Second, Kerala may be a victim of its own success. Kerala has a high COVID-19 testing rate, meaning that its elevated case numbers may be due to its catching infections that other states with lower testing rates are missing. Kerala’s containment of the first wave also means a higher share of its population is without antibodies and therefore vulnerable to the highly-infective Delta variant, says John.  “If there are two forest fires, which will last longer, the one with more dead trees or less?” asks John. Third, Kerala’s especially mobile population may be exacerbating the surge. The state has one of the largest migrant populations in India, with 2.5 million workers from other parts of the country traveling across its borders. An estimated 4 million Kerala residents live and work abroad, mostly in gulf countries like the United Arab Emirates. An estimated 1.2 million or so of the state’s residents have returned to Kerala from overseas since the beginning of the pandemic, raising the risk of imported cases. Dr. Sudhir Kalhan, chairman at the Institute of Minimal Access, Metabolic Bariatric Surgery at New Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, also notes that thousands of medical and paramedical staff recently returned home to Kerala after serving as frontline medical staff in other parts of the country. Kerala’s population is highly “migratory,” which has likely contributed to the state’s surge in infections, says Kalhan. “Probably, Kerala picked up the virus late during India’s second wave, but the good thing is the cases are plateauing around 30,000 daily,” he says. Political opponents have slammed Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for failing to protect his citizens in this stage of the pandemic and accused him of promoting the Kerala model as propaganda to gain political support. Vijayan has denied the charges.  The Kerala model for fighting COVID-19 may be on life support. But it isn’t dead. “Just because [the Kerala model] has not produced results now does not mean that it did not produce results earlier,” says Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst. In recent weeks, Kerala’s government has ramped up its vaccination campaign, setting up drive-thru vaccination centers and deploying health workers to places like construction sites to inoculate workers.  India’s government reported Thursday that 58% of the country’s adult population has received a single dose of COVID vaccine and 18% are fully vaccinated. Kerala reports that it has surged ahead of the nationwide drive, with 63% of adults receiving at least one dose of the vaccine and 38% of people fully vaccinated.  Kerala’s COVID-19 deaths, meanwhile, make up nearly half of India’s daily total. The high death rate may, in part, reflect the fact that Kerala has India’s oldest population. Kerala’s ability to limit deaths may improve as more people get vaccinated. Kerala’s health department said Thursday that 90% of people who died in Kerala from COVID-19 from June to September were unvaccinated. But the real danger of Kerala’s outbreak is that COVID-19 has run rampant despite the Kerala-model efforts to contain the virus. Now, the rest of India needs to remain on high alert so that Kerala’s surge does not spark deadly waves elsewhere, says Amir Ullah Khan, former policy adviser for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “If you ask me, there is no cogent explanation [for Kerala’s outbreak],” Khan says. “Is it a new variant we are looking at?”"
"As Cisco joins the net-zero party, how do we move from pledge to practice?",659,"Good morning. Barely a day goes by without another big company ratcheting up its commitments to fighting climate change. Today’s example is Cisco. It now plans to reach net zero for all “Scope 1” and “Scope 2” emissions—those directly within its control—by 2025. And it will hit net zero across its entire value chain by 2040. Are all these corporate commitments real? We still suffer from a mind-numbing proliferation of metrics, a lack of clear standards, and a tendency by some to make promises on behalf of future executives that they won’t be around to meet. Business is certainly stepping up its rhetoric. But that rhetoric needs to translate to action."

"20 years after 9/11, first responders are still sick, dying, and underpaid",919,"Good evening, readers. There's a simple fact that's been gnawing at me as the nation observes the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks this Saturday: Nearly eight times as many first responders have died since that seismic day as the 412 who were slain during the attacks themselves, according to an examination of the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) and health records. It's a figure that surpasses the nearly 3,000-person death toll on the day of the attacks. ""A total of 80,745 responders were enrolled in the WTCHP as of March 2021: 62,773 were classified as general responders; 17,023 were Fire Department of New York (FDNY) responders; and 989 were Pentagon and Shanksville responders,"" wrote researchers from Western Australia's Edith Cowan University School of Medical and Health Sciences in a new report published last week. ""Of the total responders in the program, 3,439 are now deceased."""
"Vaccine mandates pick up steam, but few employers say they’ll fire violators",4213,"Vaccine mandates are picking up momentum in the U.S. Nearly half of companies are requiring or considering mandating COVID-19 vaccination for employees, and President Biden is set to announce Thursday that federal employees and contractors will need to be vaccinated. The President was also expected to go further, reportedly planning an executive order that would instruct all businesses with 100 or more workers to require their employees to either get vaccinated or face mandatory testing. But new poll results suggest that employers so far have been cautious about enforcing such mandates. About 14% of employers are already requiring vaccines among all of their workers, while 29% are considering implementing a companywide mandate, according to a survey of nearly 600 employers that global professional services firm Aon fielded Aug. 17–24. About 22% of companies report requiring vaccines for on-site employees. That’s up significantly from the roughly 7% of companies that Aon found were planning vaccine mandates back in the spring.  “You're seeing a great deal of alignment across many sectors of the economy where employers have spoken up, basically in tandem with the U.S. government, saying they are much more comfortable mandating these vaccines,” Neal Mills, chief medical officer at Aon, tells Fortune.  Yet despite a rise in vaccine mandates, corporations lack universal enforcement of those requirements. Nearly half of employers, 48%, report that they allow for religious exemptions, and 47% allow exemptions for health reasons.  Even fewer companies are willing to terminate employees over these policies. Only about 7% of companies reported they would fire an employee who refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine. That percentage increased, however, among companies in industries that traditionally demand in-person work—although the majority still responded they would not terminate workers. In health care, for example, about 34% of employers say they would terminate an employee for refusing to get a vaccine, although the survey’s sample size in that industry was small.  Balancing the need to keep workers safe against providing flexibility and accommodations is “extraordinarily difficult” for companies right now, Mills says. Instead, many employers are relying on alternatives to a vaccine mandate. In fact, 43% of companies considered implementing vaccine mandates and opted against them, Aon’s survey found.  Overall, companies are employing diverse methods to handle unvaccinated workers. About 38% report they are extending available remote work options, while 20% are requiring periodic negative COVID-19 tests from unvaccinated employees. Nearly one in five companies are opting to limit the activities that unvaccinated employees can participate in on-site.  “Employers have had to revisit what they are going to do for those that are not willing to get the vaccine,” Mills says, but he adds that these alternatives are not always easy to execute. He points out that companies looking to implement testing regimes, for example, are running into issues sourcing supplies right now.  Companies can also employ safety protocols such as mask mandates and social distancing. Just over a third of employers reported requiring workers to wear masks and adhere to social distancing while on-site. “There are still more tools at employers’ disposal that they can use,” Mills says.  Beyond implementing safety protocols in the workplace, Mills says employers need to pay attention to COVID rates in their communities, especially local hospitalization rates. If a company brings everybody back to work in-person and a portion of its workforce is unvaccinated, company leaders need to assess whether there are enough beds at local hospitals if an outbreak takes place.  Over the next few weeks and months, Mills notes, companies will continue to evaluate and reevaluate their position on vaccine mandates. “There's a great deal of momentum toward more employers revisiting the decision and deciding that because [a mandate] could greatly minimize disruptions than that is a more appealing choice now,” he said. “There's still a lot on the table employers have to consider and work through here.”"
FDA delays decision on whether Juul can remain on the market,5105,"Federal health officials on Thursday delayed a high-stakes decision on whether to permit bestselling vaping brand Juul to stay on the market, while banning the sale of thousands of other electronic cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration said it rejected applications for nearly 950,000 e-cigarettes and related products, mainly due to their potential appeal to underage teens. Some of the products are currently being sold while many others were only proposed by manufacturers. But the agency didn't rule on Juul, the most popular brand with adult smokers and many teens. Parents, politicians and anti-tobacco advocates have pressured the FDA for years to ban Juul's high-nicotine devices, which many blame for the recent spike in underage vaping. But the agency said it would need more time to rule on that company's products. “There’s more work to be done to complete our remaining reviews and ensure that we continue taking appropriate action to protect our nation’s youth from the dangers of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes,” the agency said in a statement. The agency noted 80% of teens and children who vape use flavored products. Thursday’s action is part of a sweeping review by the FDA to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping industry after years of regulatory delays. The agency has yet to authorize any vaping product as a less harmful option for smokers. The FDA faced a court deadline Thursday to issue decisions on marketing applications from Juul and hundreds of other companies. The date was set by a federal judge after anti-tobacco groups successfully sued the FDA to speed up its review. To stay on the market, companies must show that their e-cigarettes benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use the products are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them. FDA regulators previously said they would prioritize Juul and a handful of other key players, but none were included in the agency's announcement. The delay was immediately panned by anti-vaping groups. “This is an outrageous move by FDA,” said Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. “Millions of families whose kids’ lives have been upended by the youth vaping epidemic created by Juul have waited long enough for action.” E-cigarettes first appeared in the U.S. more than a decade ago with the promise of providing smokers with a less harmful alternative to smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes. The devices heat a nicotine solution into a vapor that’s inhaled. But there has been little rigorous study of whether the e-cigarettes truly help smokers quit. And efforts by the FDA to begin vetting vaping products and their claims were repeatedly slowed by industry lobbying and competing political interests. Today, the vaping market includes hundreds of companies selling an array of devices and nicotine solutions in various flavors and strengths. But the vast majority of the market is controlled by a few companies including Juul Labs Inc.—which is partially owned by tobacco giant Altria—and Vuse, part of cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds. Juul accounts for nearly half of the $4 billion U.S. market but sales have fallen sharply from when the company controlled more than 75%. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and pulling all of its flavors except for menthol and tobacco. The FDA received applications for more than 6 million vaping products. The agency said Thursday it has taken action on 93% of those applications, including for 4.5 million products that were immediately rejected because they were missing key information. It is still reviewing a smaller number of applications for other non-traditional tobacco products like hookahs, pipes and mini cigars. Those products weren’t covered by the original 2009 law that first gave the FDA authority to oversee some parts of the industry, including the review of new products. Also awaiting review: larger vaping devices with refillable tanks that are mainly popular with adults and sell at specialty vape shops. The vaping issue took on new urgency in 2018 when Juul’s high-nicotine, fruity-flavored cartridges became a nationwide craze among middle and high school students, leading the FDA to declare an “epidemic” of underage vaping. Last year, the FDA limited flavors in those small vaping devices to just tobacco and menthol, and teen vaping dropped. But the question of whether e-cigarettes should be sold at all remained. Most experts agree the chemicals contained in e-cigarette vapor are less harmful than tobacco smoke, which contains thousands of cancer-causing chemicals. But there’s been little hard data that smokers who start vaping actually stay off of cigarettes. Surveys show that many people wind up using both. FDA regulators warned companies for years they would have to submit rigorous, long-term data showing a clear benefit for smokers who switch to vaping. But virtually all e-cigarette makers have resisted that kind of expensive, time-consuming research."
Microsoft postpones return-to-office plans indefinitely as Delta variant surges,2368,"Microsoft Corp. is scrapping plans to fully reopen offices by Oct. 4, saying it can no longer give a date for returning to work because the pandemic is too unpredictable.  “Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, we’ve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our U.S. work sites in favor of opening U.S. work sites as soon as we’re able to do so safely based on public health guidance,” the Redmond, Washington-based software maker said in a blog post Thursday. “From there, we’ll communicate a 30-day transition period that provides time for employees to prepare.” The strategy is similar to one adopted by fellow tech giant Apple Inc., which has delayed its own return-to-office plans multiple times. It has told employees it will give them a one-month warning on a return deadline as it copes with COVID-19’s Delta variant, which has led to a resurgence in cases. In another nod to pandemic realities, Microsoft’s LinkedIn professional-networking site will make it easier for job seekers to find remote and hybrid roles. New options will let users filter out roles in traditional offices or find workplaces that offer a mix, according to the blog post. And LinkedIn plans to make it easier to find out about companies’ vaccination requirements.  The COVID-19 pandemic has led employees to rethink how, where and why they want to work—a shift LinkedIn is calling “the great reshuffle.” Jobs listed on LinkedIn’s site as “remote” continue to increase, with such postings jumping more than 8.5 times since the start of the pandemic to 16% of the total in August. But in-person work isn’t going away, the company said. Microsoft’s rank-and-file employees plan to eventually work from offices more frequently than managers expected, according to an internal survey. Eight percent of non-managerial employees said they’re looking to be in the office every day, compared with manager expectations for only 1%. Nearly half of Microsoft employees plan to come in to the office three to four times a week, the survey found. That’s well above the 28% that managers expected. Still, the results showed that bosses generally plan to log more time in-person than their employees do. In a twist, employees who would prefer staying home and staffers who want to go back to the office both gave the same reason: They felt it was easier to focus on work."
White House unveils plan to lower prescription drug prices,1994,"The Biden administration has unveiled its road map to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra introduced the 29-page plan Thursday morning—which centers on legislation that would allow the government to negotiate prices of the most expensive drugs, then pass along those savings to private insurance companies. Currently, there are legal blockades to federal officials doing so. The plan also calls for a reduction in the number of regulatory barriers required to get a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It would boost competition among drugmakers by shortening exclusivity periods and speeding the entry of generic competitors. “Lifesaving prescription medication should not cost anyone their life savings,” said Becerra in a statement. “Yet too often, many low-income families cannot take their prescription medications because of cost concerns…By promoting negotiation, competition, and innovation in the health care industry, we will ensure cost fairness and protect access to care.” Americans, according to the plan, spend an average of over $1,500 per person on prescription drugs, paying much more than comparable nations. Because the cost of those medications is rising so fast, many people do not take them as prescribed. The plan also calls for a cap on catastrophic spending to protect beneficiaries from unaffordable out-of-pocket costs. And it would prohibit “pay-for-delay” agreements between drugmakers, which result in delays to generic versions for brand-name drugs. Lowering prescription drug costs has been a priority for both political parties. Former President Donald Trump stated that he hoped to make it a priority of his administration before the COVID-19 crisis hit. Given the longevity and severity of the pandemic, Biden’s proposal is likely to receive a bigger push. (Many states are attempting to pass their own regulations separately.) Big Pharma, however, has been resistant to previous proposals."
Biden toughens up on vaccine mandate for federal workers,2853,"President Joe Biden on Thursday is toughening COVID-19 vaccine requirements for federal workers and contractors as he aims to boost vaccinations and curb the surging Delta variant that is killing thousands each week and jeopardizing the nation’s economic recovery. Just weeks after he mandated federal workers get a shot or face rigorous testing and masking protocols, Biden has signed an new executive order to require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors that do business with the federal government, according to a person familiar with the matter. The step comes ahead of the president's speech Thursday afternoon outlining a six-pronged plan to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots. It wasn't immediately clear if Biden's order includes exceptions for workers or contractors seeking religious or medical exemptions from vaccination. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden's plans before they were publicly released. Biden is also expected to outline plans to increase virus testing in schools, in an effort to keep them open safely, amid other measures to show that his administration working to tackle the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases, which Biden has blamed for last month's weaker-than-expected jobs report. He's warned could further imperil the nation's economy as some pandemic safety net protections are expiring. Biden has encouraged COVID-19 vaccine requirements in settings likes schools, workplaces and university campuses, and the White House hopes the strengthened federal mandate will inspire more businesses to follow suit. More than 208 million Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 177 million are fully vaccinated, but confirmed cases of the virus have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day with on average about 1,000 Americans dying from the virus daily, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the spread—and the vast majority of severe illness and death—is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated against the virus. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous. Federal officials are moving ahead with plans to begin administering booster shots of the mRNA vaccines to bolster protection against the more transmissible Delta variant of the virus. Last month Biden announced plans to make them available beginning on Sept. 20, but only the Pfizer vaccine will likely have received regulatory approval for a third dose by that time. Federal regulators are seeking additional data from Moderna that will likely delay its booster approval until October. Officials are aiming to administer the booster shots about eight months after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines."
The rationales for and against a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,6228,"To booster or not to booster, that is the question facing U.S. public health experts. Last month, the Biden administration announced that all Americans would have access to an additional vaccine dose for COVID-19 by the end of the month. But the declaration was premature, and the CDC and FDA have since split with the White House, saying they need more data before making the decision. (Both agencies still recommend that people who are immunocompromised get a booster shot.) The question comes as evidence mounts that vaccine effectiveness does wane over time. Studies have shown that antibody levels gradually decline after vaccination, and lower antibody levels are associated with a higher risk of breakthrough infection. Research from the U.S., the U.K., and Israel all show an increase in breakthroughs the more time has passed since vaccination—although the Delta variant, which is more likely to evade antibodies, also played a role in the rise in cases among vaccinated people this summer. In Israel, the only country to roll out a mass booster initiative for everyone over the age of 12, two recent preprint papers—which have not yet been peer reviewed—show that a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine raises antibody levels and improves protection against infection. Backing up the research, the country appears to have turned the corner on its third wave, and case rates have dropped for the past two weeks. As Delta continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., boosting people’s immunity with a third shot seems like an easy solution. But the reality is more complicated. For one thing, while vaccine protection against infection declines over time, by some estimates bottoming out around 50%, protection against hospitalization and death remains high, dipping only slightly from an average of 95% to 85%. Hospital data from the U.S. and Israel bear this out, where the vast majority of beds are taken up by people who are still unvaccinated. “I think some people, when they hear waning immunity, they think, ‘Oh no, after five or six months, I no longer have any immune protection. The vaccine doesn't work at all.’ But the data doesn’t say that,” says Jeffrey Morris, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania. “The waning immune protection doesn’t mean it’s gone, it just means that it’s decreased, especially against infection. And when we look against severe disease and hospitalization, we don’t really see much waning there at all.” As a result, one ongoing debate is whether everyone should get a third dose or only the groups that have the highest risk. An argument in favor of booster shots for all is that, in many ways, immunity is a numbers game. Even if the statistical likelihood of developing severe disease is small, the more people who are infected overall, the more hospitalizations and deaths there will be. By increasing protection against infection during a surge, you will stop the spread of the virus, and in turn limit the number of people with serious illness. That was the rationale in Israel, where a surge in cases this summer overwhelmed hospitals despite a high vaccination rate. In response, the Israeli Ministry of Health all but mandated a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for everyone who was eligible—if you didn’t get your booster shot, your vaccine passport expired. “Israel has been kind of in a crisis with a runaway case burden, which is only now starting to get under control, so they pulled out all the stops,” says Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. “We know that if you’re at any age, if you’re vaccinated and you get a breakthrough, you still can transmit to others. The chances are much less than if you were unvaccinated, but to break the chain, they pulled out all the stops. The question is, would we benefit in the U.S. by doing that? And that’s an unknown.” Instead of offering booster shots to all Americans, Topol suggests limiting eligibility to those who would benefit the most: people who are immunocompromised, over the age of 60, or frontline health care workers. “I think the booster case is very solid now for people over age 60…and you can also make a pretty strong case for health care workers because they need to be taking care of the sick,” he says. “After that, we don’t really have data yet…but there’s going to be a lesser net benefit of the boosters, most likely, as we go down in age.” Yair Lewis, an Israeli physician and former member of the country’s COVID-19 advisory team, agrees. Instead of boosting everybody’s antibody levels, he says a third dose should only be offered to the most vulnerable. The rest of the population should be protected through nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as masking, frequent testing, and quarantining after exposure to the virus. “I think there was close to a consensus that from the way the surge was going on in Israel, it was really important to vaccinate the high-risk populations,” Lewis says. “I definitely supported that. Then there came the issue. ‘Okay, so are we going to boost the entire population?’ And I can speak for myself—I can also tell you that a lot of the colleagues I’ve spoken with think something similar—is that it probably would have been wiser to enforce some sort of light NPI, some nonpharmaceutical interventions.” One reason for restricting booster shots is the ethical argument that the doses should be saved for countries where vaccination rates are much lower. Another is that resources should still be focused on improving uptake among those who remain unvaccinated. Morris, the UPenn biostatistician, worries that requiring a third dose will dissuade people who are on the fence from getting a vaccine because they’ll interpret it as meaning the vaccines aren’t very effective. “To get some benefit from just supercharging a little bit of the immune protection that the previously vaccinated already has is nice, but if it comes at the cost of not being able to get more of the unvaccinated to be protected, it could be a net negative,” he says. “Getting even one dose in an unvaccinated person will reduce transmission and risk of serious disease way more than getting a third dose in a previously [vaccinated] person.”"
United reports big success getting unvaccinated workers to take COVID jab,2837,"United Airlines says that more than half its employees who weren't vaccinated last month have gotten their shots since the company announced that vaccines would be required. The airline's 67,000 U.S.-based employees face a Sept. 27 deadline for getting vaccinated. United said Wednesday, however, that employees whose bids for exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs are denied will get five more weeks to get vaccinated. After that, the airline said, they will face termination or unpaid leave. Kirk Limacher, United's vice president of human resources, made the statement about vaccinations Wednesday in memos to employees that spell out how United will handle requests for exemptions. United declined to say exactly how many employees have recently been vaccinated, what percentage of the workforce is now vaccinated, or how many workers requested an exemption. The airline said it will have enough workers to operate its schedule this fall and into the holidays. The airline said that in most cases, employees who refuse to get vaccinated won't be allowed into the workplace starting Oct. 2. United says requests for medical exemptions will be judged by medical staffers including nurses, while requests for waivers based on religious beliefs will be handled by personnel-office employees. The process for handling workers whose exemptions are approved will vary slightly depending on the employee's job. Workers who routinely come in contact with passengers, such as flight attendants, gate agents and pilots, and whose exemptions are approved will face indefinite unpaid leave starting Oct. 2. They won't be allowed back on the job until the pandemic “meaningfully recedes,” according to one of the memos. Employees who rarely deal with passengers — examples include baggage handlers and mechanics — and whose exemptions are approved will also be put on leave, but only until the airline comes up with a plan for weekly testing and mandatory mask-wearing for them. Headquarters employees whose exemptions are approved will be placed on leave until United decides on safety measures, including whether the person needs to come into the office. In explaining the rules to employees, United cites statistics on the state of the pandemic in the U.S., where new infections are at their highest level since March and “likely to rise into the fall as more people are hospitalized.” Most of the cases, hospitalizations and deaths are occurring among unvaccinated people, the memos said. Chicago-based United has taken the strongest pro-vaccination stance among U.S. airlines. Delta Air Lines says it will levy a $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated employees who are covered by the company’s health plan. Others including American Airlines say they will cut off paid leave for unvaccinated workers who contract COVID-19."

Singapore’s COVID reports will now focus on hospitalizations as community cases hit record levels,2368,"Singapore is shifting the focus of its daily reports to hospitalizations to turn attention to its medical capacity alongside plans to manage the virus as endemic, as the country’s daily count of COVID cases in the local community rose to the highest it’s ever been. At 81%, Singapore has the best vaccination rate in the world among countries of more than 1 million people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet daily cases—the vast majority of which are mild or asymptomatic—are on the rise.  There are signs that Singapore’s mass vaccination is holding down serious cases. While the overall number of daily local cases has doubled in the past week to 347, the number of serious cases requiring supplemental oxygen or intensive care is about the same as last week.  Singapore is changing the way it reports the COVID-19 situation. The Ministry of Health is now leading its daily report with data on serious cases in a shift that focuses attention on its hospital capacity instead of the rising number of cases.  The city-state will no longer report the number of linked and unlinked cases “as this is no longer as relevant as before, given our current strategy of living with COVID-19,” the ministry said in a statement accompanying its daily update, which will also be cut to once instead of twice a day from Thursday.  “We are now in a very different stage of our battle against COVID-19,” the health ministry said. The revamped reports will “reflect the salient issues” such as whether hospital capacity is getting overwhelmed, it said. While the daily report doesn’t list Singapore’s system-wide capacity, previous statements suggest the city-state isn’t anywhere close to its limits. For example, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in July said as many as 1,000 ICU beds could be made available to COVID-19 patients if needed. Just six are in ICU now. At its peak, in April of 2020, there were as many as 32 people in ICU.  Singapore is also looking to expand its health care capacity beyond critical care. The government has space for more than 5,500 COVID-positive people with mild or no visible symptoms in community care facilities, which is about 2,000 more beds than the total number of people in Singapore who got COVID over the last month. Additionally, the government is piloting a program that would allow some mildly ill patients to recover at home.  "
Parkinson’s disease has no approved treatment. Scientists want to use lab grown mini-brains to change that,2870,"Upwards of 10 million people globally and nearly 1 million in the United States live with Parkinson's disease, which has no approved treatments. The only option for patients is drugs that can keep the degenerative condition in check, rather than tackle its root causes. A group of scientists now wants to upend that dynamic by leveraging lab-grown, human mini-brains to spur Parkinson's research and drug development. In a study first published in the July edition of the journal Annals of Neurology, scientists used these synthetic mini-brains to mimic the activity of a regular human midbrain, which is critical to muscle movement and visual and auditory processing affected by Parkinson's disease. In essence the researchers replicated what an actual human brain would go through if it carried all the risk factors for a certain brain disease, in this case Parkinson's. That's particularly important since drug development for the disease must currently be done using mouse brains, which may produce different results than when using those of humans. For instance, certain biological wear and tear doesn't manifest in a mouse, and a mouse model in Parkinson's R&D may not produce the kinds of biological by-products linked with the disease. ""Re-creating models of Parkinson’s disease in animal models is hard, as these do not show the progressive and selective loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, a major feature of Parkinson’s disease,"" said Ng Huck Hui of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Biomedical Research Council and the study's senior coauthor. The inability to directly access the brain and the complexity of the nervous system are key reasons brain drugs are so hard to create. To wit: The last Parkinson's treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was Kyowa Kirin's Nourianz in 2019, and that was as a therapy added on to another one that controls symptoms rather than the disease. The hope is that a better understanding of what a Parkinson's disease patient's brain goes through will make it easier to deconstruct the illness and spur drug development. The researchers created the pea-size mini-brains by growing stem cells that create neurons. They were able to modify this human-based mini-brain with genetic tweaks to the stem cells that, in turn, mimicked the genomic qualities associated with a higher risk for Parkinson's. For this study, the researchers focused only on Parkinson's, the second-most common neurodegenerative condition in the U.S. and second only to Alzheimer's. But they hope that their synthetic, genetic template can be used in all manner of future brain disease research. The study was conducted by researchers from the Agency of Science, Technology and Research's Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute, and Duke-NUS Medical School."
COVID deaths are up 34%. See the states where ICU beds are in short supply,275,"Will the world ever rid itself of COVID? Unlikely, said the World Health Organization’s Mike Ryan yesterday at a press conference in Geneva.

"This city has over 24,000 COVID cases in its schools—and others are catching up",2521,"As schools settle in for a rocky start to the academic year, COVID cases are exploding in many cities. There isn't a national database of COVID outbreaks in schools, but school districts’ reporting shows concerning numbers of positive COVID tests from both students and school staff.

Atlanta’s school district has found 24,270 confirmed cases since the start of the school year—and that’s without data from Clayton County, one of the area’s largest districts, being updated. Last week alone, nearly 6,000 students tested positive. That’s an increase of over 20,000 cases in under a month. Other large school districts around the U.S. don't match Atlanta's high numbers, but they are catching up quickly. For instance, Tampa has nearly 9,000 students in quarantine after just the first week of school. Los Angeles reported 5,307 cases as of Sept. 1, despite some of the strictest safety protocols in the country. Another 729 school staff in L.A. schools have also been infected. Texas schools' case numbers are notably higher than Atlanta. Statewide, nearly 52,000 students (and almost 14,000 staffers) have tested positive this school year. And more students tested positive last week than during the peak period of the 2020–2021 school year. In Houston alone, there are over 11,500 cases among students and staff. New York City public schools are set to reopen on Sept. 13, and parents and onlookers will be watching the numbers from the city carefully. What’s concerning in these cities isn’t just the numbers, it’s how fast the virus is spreading. Atlanta schools have been in session since early August. Texas began going back around Aug. 9, but it was a rolling return. Neither Georgia nor Texas is requiring students to wear masks. Not every large school district is in crisis mode, though. Chicago schools have only officially reported 11 student and 28 employee cases so far this year, though the city doesn’t update its data in real time (and teachers’ union officials say they’ve been told over 900 students are in quarantine). San Jose’s three largest districts, meanwhile, have reported just 120 COVID cases year to date, giving credit to mandatory mask orders. And Miami has reported 147 students and 186 employees testing positive since school tracking began on Aug. 13. Since that time, though, 13 school employees have died from the virus. Several school districts do not make public announcements on COVID case numbers, but they will occasionally post a notice on social media or their district website."
Florida judge says schools can continue to impose mask mandates,2056,"Florida schools can start legally requiring masks, a state court judge ruled, even as Governor Ron DeSantis appeals an earlier decision invalidating his ban on mask mandates. Leon County Circuit Court Judge John C. Cooper ruled last month in favor of parents who challenged the governor’s ban, and Florida appealed his decision, triggering an automatic hold on it. On Wednesday Cooper vacated that stay, allowing schools to issue and enforce mask mandates without fear of penalties such as withholding funds.  It’s highly unusual to vacate an automatic stay, the judge said at a hearing held over Zoom. But “we’re not in normal times—we’re in a pandemic,” he said. “We have children who can’t be protected by a vaccination.” Whether to require masks at school amid a surge of coronavirus cases has become an explosive political issue across the U.S. Republicans opposed to mask rules say it should be a matter of personal choice rather than a government requirement. Similar court fights are underway in several other states, including Texas and Oklahoma. In Florida itself a hearing is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in a federal case involving schoolchildren with disabilities. An executive order by DeSantis, a Republican and possible presidential contender in 2024, set in motion a process under which the Florida Department of Health effectively barred blanket mask mandates in schools. The state argued that the ban was in keeping with its new Parents’ Bill of Rights, which DeSantis signed this year. The law gives mothers and fathers the last word on health care for their children. The parents suing DeSantis argued he banned mask rules even as the Delta variant of the virus was spreading in Florida far faster than a year ago, when students were required to wear masks. Many districts, including the state’s largest, in Miami-Dade County, have already instituted such mandates in defiance of the state. The case is McCarthy v. DeSantis, 2021-CA-001382, Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit Court (Tallahassee). —With assistance from Erik Larson."
"For Silicon Valley, returning to the office is easier said than done",7384,"Technology companies that led the charge into remote work as the pandemic unfurled are confronting a new challenge: how, when and even whether they should bring long-isolated employees back to offices that have been designed for teamwork. “I thought this period of remote work would be the most challenging year-and-half of my career, but it’s not,” said Brent Hyder, the chief people officer for business software maker Salesforce and its roughly 65,000 employees worldwide. “Getting everything started back up the way it needs to be is proving to be even more difficult.” That transition has been complicated by the rapid spread of the Delta variant, which has scrambled the plans many tech companies had for bringing back most of their workers near or after Labor Day weekend. Microsoft has pushed those dates back to October while Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and a growing list of others have already decided wait until next year. Given how they set the tone for remote work, tech companies’ return-to-office policies will likely have ripple effects across other industries. Employers’ next steps could redefine how and where people work, predicts Laura Boudreau, a Columbia University assistant economics professor who studies workplace issues. “We have moved beyond the theme of remote work being a temporary thing,” Boudreau says. The longer the pandemic has stretched on, she says, the harder it’s become to tell employees to come back to the office, particularly full time. Because they typically revolve around digital and online products, most tech jobs are tailor made for remote work. Yet most major tech companies insist that their employees should be ready to work in the office two or three days each week after the pandemic is over. The main reason: Tech companies have long believed that employees clustered together in a physical space will swap ideas and spawn innovations that probably wouldn’t have happened in isolation. That’s one reason tech titans have poured billions of dollars into corporate campuses interspersed with alluring common areas meant to lure employees out of their cubicles and into “casual collisions” that turn into brainstorming sessions. But the concept of “water cooler innovation” may be overblown, says Christy Lake, chief people officer for business software maker Twilio. “There is no data that supports that really happens in real life, and yet we all subscribe to it,” Lake says. “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle and tell people, ‘Oh you have to be back in the office or innovation won’t happen.’ “ Twilio isn’t bringing back most of its roughly 6,300 employees back to its offices until early next year at the earliest, and plans to allow most of them to figure how frequently they should come in. This hybrid approach permitting employees to toggle between remote and in-office work has been widely embraced in the technology industry, particularly among the largest companies with the biggest payrolls. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 200 companies responding to a mid-July survey in the tech-centric Bay area said they are expecting their workers to come into the office two or three days each week. Before the pandemic, 70% of these employers required their workers to be in the office, according to the Bay Area Council, a business policy group that commissioned the poll. Even Zoom, the Silicon Valley videoconferencing service that saw its revenue and stock price soar during the pandemic, says most of its employees still prefer to come into the office part of the time. “There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to returning to the office,” Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom’s chief financial officer, recently wrote in a blog post. But the biggest tech companies, which have profited even more than Zoom as the pandemic that made their products indispensable for many workers, aren’t giving employees much choice in the matter. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have made it clear that they want most of their workers together at least a few days each week to maintain their culture and pace of innovation. That well-worn creed sounds like backward thinking to Ed Zitron, who runs a public relations firm representing technology companies—and which has been fully remote since it launched in 2012. The only reason to have an office, he says, is to satisfy managers with vested interests in grouping people together “so that they can look at them and feel good about the people that they own...so that they can enjoy that power.” Switching to hybrid work is ideal for people like Kelly Soderlund, a mother of two young children who works in offices in San Francisco and Palo Alto, California, for travel management company TripActions, which has about 1,200 employees worldwide. She couldn’t wait to return when the company partially reopened its offices in June, partly because she missed the built-in buffer that her roughly one-hour commute provided between her personal and professional life. “When I don’t have that, I wake up in the morning, I start doing work and I take my kids to their camp or their daycare,” Soderlund says. “And then I come back and I work and then we pick them up, make dinner and then I go back to work. So, it feels like it’s just work all the time.” Soderlund believes being together in an office leads to more collaboration, although she also learned from the pandemic that workers don’t need to be there every day for teamwork to happen. Camaraderie and the need to separate work from home are among the top reasons employees at business software maker Adobe Software cite for coming back to the office, said Gloria Chen, chief people officer for one of Silicon Valley’s older companies. Working from home “is here to stay, but we also continue to value people coming together,” she said. The transition from the pandemic should enable smaller tech companies to adopt more flexible work-from-home policies that may help them lure away top-notch engineers from other firms more insistent on having people in the office, says Boudreau, the Columbia University scholar. “Labor markets are relatively tight now, so employees have more bargaining chips than they have had in a while,” Boudreau says. Ankur Dahiya, who launched his software startup RunX last year during the pandemic lockdowns, believes that remote work has helped him hire employees that otherwise may not have been candidates. The eight-worker startup rents a San Francisco office one day a week so Dahiya can meet with employees who live nearby, but other employees are in Canada, Nevada, and Oregon. The workers living outside of California have been flying in once every three months for “super productive” meetings and brainstorming, says Dahiya, who has previously worked at Facebook and Twitter. “I’ve worked in offices for the last 10 years and I know there’s just so much time lost,” Dahiya says, recalling all the random conversations, lengthy meetings, aimless wandering, and other disruptions that seem to occur in those settings. Twilio’s Lake is hoping the remote-work experience will transform employee behavior in the office, too, once they come back. She hopes that the remote experience will have given employees a chance to better understand how their teams work. “I think more than anything it is going to cause us to become more intentional about when, why and how we come together,” she says."
Global COVID vaccine program Covax falls short of its distribution target,2095,"The global program set up to immunize the world against COVID-19 cut its 2021 supply forecast by more than a quarter, hampered by delays in acquiring life-saving vaccines. Covax expects to have about 1.4 billion doses by the end of the year, the organizations coordinating the initiative said Wednesday. In June, Covax had forecast that about 1.9 billion doses would be available by the end of 2021. Some manufacturers and countries have prioritized bilateral deals, while export bans and challenges in scaling up production are among other factors hindering the rollout, they said.  “This is of course bad for the whole world as we’ve seen the dreadful consequences that take hold when the virus is left to roam unchecked,” Seth Berkley, chief executive officer of the vaccine alliance Gavi, told reporters in a briefing. “We cannot afford further delays.” The effort to deliver vaccines equitably to the whole world has run into hurdles after wealthy countries raced ahead in protecting their own populations. Only a fifth of people in lower-income countries have received a first dose, compared with 80% in higher-income nations, according to Gavi and its partners. Covax now expects to hit a milestone of 2 billion doses for delivery in the first quarter of 2022. Covax so far has fallen short of its targets, delivering about 243 million doses to 139 countries. Berkley and others have called for transparency from manufacturers to ensure that developing countries aren’t getting bumped to the back of the queue. They’re also pushing for countries to give up their place in line if they have enough doses. “Are we content?” Berkley said. “Absolutely not. But we are in the process of accelerating.” On Tuesday, drugmakers reiterated calls for governments to share vaccine doses, saying Group of Seven countries have enough supplies to both satisfy their own needs and increase stocks available for low-and middle-income countries. Wealthy countries will probably have about 1.2 billion extra doses available to redistribute by the end of the year, according to estimates from Airfinity Ltd."

"Stretched to the limits, Idaho health experts enact ‘crisis care standards’ amid COVID surge",5145,"Idaho public health leaders activated “crisis standards of care” for the state's northern hospitals because there are more coronavirus patients than the institutions can handle. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare quietly enacted the move Monday and publicly announced it in a statement Tuesday morning—warning residents that they may not get the care they would normally expect if they need to be hospitalized. It came as the state's confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocketed in recent weeks. Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. The agency cited “a severe shortage of staffing and available beds in the northern area of the state caused by a massive increase in patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization.” The designation includes 10 hospitals and healthcare systems in the Idaho panhandle and in north-central Idaho. The agency said its goal is to extend care to as many patients as possible and to save as many lives as possible. The move allows hospitals to allot scarce resources like intensive care unit rooms to patients most likely to survive. Other patients will still receive care, but they may be placed in hospital classrooms or conference rooms rather than traditional hospital rooms or go without some life-saving medical equipment. Other states are preparing to take similar measures if needed. Hawaii Gov. David Ige quietly signed an order last week releasing hospitals and health care workers from liability if they have to ration health care. It's a scene that Idaho's health care providers have anticipated with dread. Medical experts have said that Idaho could have as many as 30,000 new coronavirus cases a week by mid-September if the current rate of infections lasts. “Crisis standards of care is a last resort. It means we have exhausted our resources to the point that our healthcare systems are unable to provide the treatment and care we expect,” Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in a statement. He added: “This is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid. The best tools we have to turn this around is for more people to get vaccinated and to wear masks indoors and in outdoor crowded public places. Please choose to get vaccinated as soon as possible—it is your very best protection against being hospitalized from COVID-19.” The designation will remain in effect until there are enough resources—including staffing, hospital beds and equipment or a drop in the number of patients—to provide normal levels of treatment to all. More than 500 people were hospitalized statewide with COVID-19 on Sept. 1—the most recent data available on the Department of Health and Welfare's website—and more than a third of them were in intensive care unit beds. Idaho's hospitals have struggled to fill empty nursing, housekeeping and other health care positions, in part because some staffers have left because they are burned out by the strain of the pandemic and because others have been quarantined because they were exposed to COVID-19. Idaho Gov. Brad Little called the move to limit care “an unprecedented and unwanted point in the history of our state” and urged residents to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that full vaccination with any of the currently available coronavirus vaccines dramatically reduces the risk of requiring hospitalization for a coronavirus infection. “More Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines,” said Little, who is a Republican. When the pandemic first came to Idaho at the start of 2020, Little ordered a partial shutdown of the state—ordering some businesses to temporarily close or shift to take-out style services, banning some large gatherings and asking residents to stay home as much as possible. The move was aimed at ensuring that hospitals wouldn't become overwhelmed by patients. Idaho was on the verge of enacting crisis standards of care during a major coronavirus surge last winter, but narrowly avoided doing so—making this the first time the state has taken the drastic measure. Little reopened the state in stages over a period of several months and has not reimposed restrictions limiting gatherings. Businesses are mostly operating as normal. The state's crisis guidelines are complex, and give hospitals a legal and ethical template to use while rationing care. Under the guidelines, patients are given priority scores based on a number of factors that impact their likelihood of surviving a health crisis. Those deemed in most in of care and most likely to benefit from it are put on priority lists for scarce resources like ICU beds. Others in dire need but with lower chances of surviving will be given “comfort care” to help keep them pain-free whether they succumb to their illnesses or recover. Other patients with serious but not life-threatening medical problems will face delays in receiving care until resources are available."

"Johnson & Johnson vaccine reduces COVID infections by half among health workers, according to a new study",3822,"Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine cuts the risk of getting infected with the disease by about half, according to the latest results of a trial involving almost half a million health workers in South Africa.   The vast majority of the breakthrough infections were mild, Glenda Gray, co-leader of the study known as Sisonke, said in an interview, citing unpublished data from the trial, which had earlier shown the shot’s effectiveness against severe illness. Like all COVID vaccines, J&J’s was intended and tested for its ability to prevent COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Even so, the frequency of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people highlights the challenge governments face in halting the virus’s spread, which threatens to lead to the proliferation of new variants that may be even more contagious. Coupled with vaccine hesitancy, the limited efficacy of shots in stopping mild infections will mean “we will continue to see a flow of infections,” said Bruce Mellado, a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg who uses modeling to predict the trajectory of infections. Still, he said, the effectiveness against death and severe disease could prevent a “human catastrophe.” J&J didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The study included several weeks during which South Africa was going through a third wave of coronavirus infections, spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant. The emergence of new, fast-spreading strains has made earlier goals of herd immunity—when the proportion of the population that’s vulnerable to the virus sinks so low that it stifles spread—harder to reach.  By cutting the number and the intensity of infections, the vaccines limit the chance of further mutated strains emerging. Yet for many countries, the focus has shifted to reducing the seriousness of illness and subsequent demand for more intensive treatments.  The Sisonke trial measured breakthrough infections both by asking participants to report a positive result as well as by getting daily alerts from testing laboratories. The researchers also tapped data systems to see who had been hospitalized or died.  Initial results from Sisonke, released Aug. 6, showed J&J’s single-dose vaccine was about 70% effective against hospitalization and as much as 96% effective against death. The trial didn’t include the use of a placebo. The final results which include three sets of data from private insurers and the government, will be submitted for publication in days, said Gray, who’s a research professor at the University of the Witwatersrand. The J&J vaccine, a key element in South Africa’s vaccination plan, has also been given to teachers, police, and other government employees. It’s expected to play an important role in reaching remote areas, as it can be stored at refrigerator temperature.  The Sisonke trial was put in place in February after the South African government’s plans to use AstraZeneca Plc’s shot showed limited efficacy against mild cases, disrupting government plans for a wide government rollout. Gray and other scientists concluded an agreement with J&J to run a mass trial. Other vaccines in wide use have indicated vulnerability to breakthrough infections. A study released Aug. 9 showed that Moderna Inc.’s was associated with a two-fold reduction of breakthrough risk compared with the shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. The results were reported ahead of peer review. The results against breakthrough infections are “not unique to Johnson & Johnson, but also for other vaccines,” said Shabir Madhi, a vaccinologist from the University of the Witwatersrand who led trials of both AstraZeneca’s and Novavax Inc.’s shots in South Africa. “It comes as little surprise with ongoing evolution of the virus.” —With assistance from Riley Griffin."
Israel was a vaccination poster child. Now its COVID surge shows the world what’s coming next,4797,"Israel, once a front-runner in the global race to move on from COVID-19, is now one of the world’s biggest pandemic hot spots. The country that was once predicted to be the first to vaccinate its entire population had the highest per-capita caseload of anywhere in the week through Sept. 4, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Its world-beating inoculation rate, meanwhile, has tumbled down the league table. The nation of 9 million became the test case for reopening society and the economy in April when much of Europe and the U.S. were still in some form of lockdown. Yet Israel now shows how the calculus is changing in places where progress was fastest. It’s no longer just about whether people get coronavirus, but also how badly they get it and ensuring that vaccines are still working as the highly infectious Delta variant threatens to undermine immunity. More recently, it has led the way when it comes to vaccinating children and rolling out a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after research suggested reduced efficacy over time. Around 100,000 Israelis are getting inoculated every day, the vast majority of them with a third shot. “If you are able to maintain life without lockdown, and to avoid very high numbers of hospitalizations and death, then this is what life with COVID looks like,” said Eyal Leshem, a professor specializing in infectious diseases at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Ha-Shomer. Since April, Israel has fallen from first to 33rd in Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker of populations considered fully vaccinated. The program plateaued amid hesitancy from some in the Orthodox Jewish and Arab communities. About 61% of Israelis have been given two doses, lower than in European laggards earlier in the year such as France and Spain. Following the spread of the Delta variant over the summer, Israel has seen cases climb, reaching an all-time high of 11,316 daily cases on Sept. 2. The number of people falling seriously sick and being hospitalized, though, has risen less than it did during the last coronavirus wave, peaking at 751 in late August, compared with 1,183 in mid-January. The trend is now downward. Infections jumped because of the prevalence of cases among the unvaccinated, especially children. There were also so-called breakthrough infections in those who have been vaccinated, and the drop in efficacy of vaccines. That said, unvaccinated people account for more than 10 times as many serious cases as those who have received two doses, showing that even with immunity waning, shots are providing protection. For public health officials and politicians, the latest chapter of the pandemic is to concentrate on ensuring older people more at risk continue to be protected while cases are rising among children. The importance of that drive is heightened by the return of millions of children to schools last week, and the Jewish New Year this week. Epidemiologists say cases among the over 30s are already declining thanks to the boosters and restrictions on bars and restaurants to the fully vaccinated. The highest rate of new cases in recent weeks is among children under the age of 12, according to Ran Balicer, chair of the expert advisory panel to the government. There’s also a record level of testing. “Waning immunity is a real challenge that every country needs to prepare a contingency plan to tackle,” said Balicer, who is also chief innovation officer for Israeli health maintenance organization Clalit. The data coming from Israel in the coming weeks will allow the world to assess the efficacy of the booster shot program, he said. As of Sept. 6, at least 2.6 million people in Israel—around 28% of the population—have now had the booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to the Israeli Health Ministry. That rises to at least 64% for people in age brackets over 60. Significantly, the booster shot is also available for anyone over 12 who was vaccinated at least five months ago. The wildcard is the return of schools. That could change the transmission dynamics and expose all age groups to infection because of kids coming home with COVID-19, Balicer said. The World Health Organization’s heat map puts Israel in the top five in the wider European region. The rolling data show areas with the highest seven-day infection rates are in Scotland, where 68% of the population are fully vaccinated. Cases surged after restrictions were lifted and then schools returned from their summer break in mid-August. “If we look back a year ago, we virtually had no protection other than a complete lockdown,” said Leshem. “Now, we have an open education system, fully open commerce, and despite over 50,000 cases a week, we are not seeing increases in the number of severe cases and hospitalization.”"
Clorox reveals new emissions targets that increase supply-chain pressure,637,"This is the web version of CEO Daily, a daily newsletter of must-read insights from Fortune CEO Alan Murray. Sign up to get it delivered free to your inbox. Good morning. The pandemic sent Clorox Company’s stock on a roller coaster ride, soaring 60% in the first half of last year as cleaning-obsessed customers cleared its products off store shelves. It has since lost most of that increase, as performance has lagged and supply chain problems have pinched. But when I talked last week with CEO Linda Rendle, who took over the top job one year ago, she still had no doubt that the pandemic‘s effect on her company had been net positive."
Why more companies like Nike are closing their offices for a mental health break,785,"A week-long mental health break is quickly becoming a popular perk as companies attempt to address worker burnout.  Last week, Nike became the latest company to close its offices for a week to give employees a mental health break. That’s after LinkedIn, Bumble, and Hootsuite have all shut down their offices for a week this year to address mental health.

“This past year has been rough—we're all human! and living through a traumatic event!—but I'm hopeful that the empathy and grace we continue to show our teammates will have a positive impact on the culture of work moving forward,” wrote Matt Marrazzo, a senior manager at Nike on his LinkedIn page. “It's not just a ‘week off’ for the team... It's an acknowledgment that we can prioritize mental health and still get work done.”"
Rich countries will soon have over 1 billion COVID vaccine doses they don’t need,3965,"Wealthy countries face mounting pressure to divert COVID vaccine supplies to lower-income regions, with a new analysis showing they’ll likely have about 1.2 billion extra doses available by the end of the year. The U.S., Britain, European nations and others could satisfy their own needs—vaccinating about 80% of their populations over the age of 12 and moving ahead with booster programs—and still have large quantities to redistribute globally, according to London-based analytics firm Airfinity Ltd.  Those governments have so far delivered a meager amount of the supplies they’ve pledged to poorer countries as some move forward with plans for booster shots in a race to combat the Delta variant. Health advocates worry that the slow pace will prolong the pandemic and increase the risk more worrisome variants will emerge. Some are also calling for more transparency on the agreements between governments and manufacturers. “There needs to be an urgent global reckoning,” said Fatima Hassan, founder and director of the Health Justice Initiative, a non-profit in Cape Town. “We need to divert doses to those in need and open all the contracts.” An independent review of the international COVID response earlier this year urged high-income nations to provide more than 2 billion doses to poorer regions by mid-2022. Of the more than 1 billion doses Group of Seven countries and the EU have pledged, less than 15% has been delivered, Airfinity found.  The issue is often seen as a choice between going ahead with booster campaigns at home or reallocating doses abroad, Rasmus Bech Hansen, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “Our data is showing it’s a false dichotomy,” he said. “You can do both.” Global output is rising steadily, and disruption seems unlikely, he said. Production could cross 12 billion doses by the end of the year, including shots in China, Airfinity estimates. That’s more than the roughly 11 billion required to vaccinate the world. Western countries have about 500 million doses available to be redistributed today, some of that already donated, with that number rising to about 2.2 billion by the middle of 2022, the analysis shows. The Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE vaccine accounts for about 45% of the available shots that could be redistributed, while Moderna Inc.’s makes up roughly a quarter of the total, according to Airfinity. Many lower-income nations are relying on Covax, an initiative led by groups including the World Health Organization that’s designed to provide fair access to the shots for every country, but the program has fallen short of its targets. COVID booster plans should be postponed until more shots are distributed to countries where they’re scarce, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said.  Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s booster program is mired in controversy of its own, having encountered pushback from health authorities in the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who say scientific support is lacking. Health leaders in the European Union have also said that boosters aren’t yet needed as the current regimens of COVID shots remain effective.  “High-income countries have ordered over twice as many doses as are needed for their populations,” the former co-chairs of the panel that reviewed the COVID response wrote last week. “Now is the time to show solidarity with those who have not yet been able to vaccinate their frontline health workers and most vulnerable populations.” It’s not just a question of having the means to acquire COVID vaccines, Bech Hansen said. There needs to be a more coordinated effort globally to allow countries with ample supplies to resell and donate doses, he said. “It’s not a purely high-income-world, low-income-world discussion—it’s a little more complicated than that,” he said. “One could imagine the U.S., the U.K. and the EU getting together and agreeing on a way forward.”"
Drugmakers position their latecomer COVID vaccines as booster shots for the local market,3757,"Daiichi Sankyo Co.’s home-grown COVID vaccine, a cutting-edge mRNA shot that’s on the cusp of its final clinical trials, could be used mainly as a booster starting next year for people who have already been immunized, the Japanese drugmaker said.  While inoculations from companies including Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc. are being rolled out across the globe, many others are still in development. Manufacturers including Daiichi are targeting local markets that don’t have an ample vaccine supply or are anticipating future needs, including booster shots.   “The most likely scenario is that most people in Japan would’ve gotten one of the already-approved vaccines by next year,”  said Shizuko Ueno, the project leader for COVID vaccine development at Daiichi Sankyo. “We expect that it could be used as a third booster shot and are looking into running a trial for that as well.” Japan, which has vaccinated nearly half of its population, has deals with Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca for enough shots to cover all its residents. The country has also made additional purchases for shots in anticipation of needing a third dose, which may start next year.   The timeline could be a hurdle for Daiichi, which is developing the shot with the University of Tokyo. It’s aiming for full regulatory approval by the second half of next year. Japan’s regulators would have to clear it as a primary shot before considering it as a booster dose, Ueno said in an interview with Bloomberg. The company is working closely with the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, which advises the health ministry on approvals, she said.  The island nation currently doesn’t allow mix-and-match vaccinations, though the government has indicated it wants to consider it. Research has shown that giving people follow up vaccines that work differently than their original dose may yield a stronger and more protective immune response.  Daiichi, one of Japan’s largest drugmakers, is best known for its cancer treatments and has made several high-profile development agreements in recent years with AstraZeneca. Daiichi is also helping manufacture AstraZeneca’s vaccines in Japan.  The final trial for Daiichi’s vaccine will involve thousands of people across multiple countries, though it hasn’t yet started enrolling, Ueno said. It will directly compare the novel shot to another vaccine already on the market, reflecting a shift in trial design since it’s no longer considered ethical to test an active COVID shot against a placebo.  Two other head-to-head studies currently underway use AstraZeneca’s shot as a basis for comparison, including one from GlaxoSmithKline Plc and South Korea’s SK Bioscience Co.  “We haven’t decided which to use yet for comparison,” Ueno said. “There’s different schools of thought about whether we should use the Pfizer or Moderna, which are similar mRNA vaccines, or use the AstraZeneca.” Japan’s pharmaceutical industry has been slow in developing a home-grown vaccine, but companies like Daiichi, Shionogi & Co. and AnGes Inc. are still investing in the effort, anticipating domestic demand and eyeing future markets overseas.   Daiichi’s mRNA vaccine works in a similar way to Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots, two of the most effective immunizations now on the market. But Daiichi’s shot will have a more specific mechanism of action. It will prompt the body’s healthy cells to to make a specific part of the coronavirus’ spike protein, called the receptor binding domain, said Masayuki Yabuta, an executive officer for the company’s biologics division. Since the receptor binding domain doesn’t change as the virus mutates, the idea is that it may retain its effectiveness against future variants, Yabuta said."
‘Munchausen by Internet’ and the dangers of self-diagnosing mental health issues on TikTok,6382,"Down the rabbit hole that is mental health TikTok—a place where people with disabilities and mental illnesses can come to vent, joke, and relate to others about the troubles of what it means to exist with a disorder or disease—you will be asked a series of questions to see where you might fit in. Do you feel restless? Do you find it hard to pay attention and often interrupt others while they’re talking? Do you have trouble maintaining relationships? Then you might have ADHD, these videos say. Do you think everyone is judging you? Are you a perfectionist and a people pleaser? Do you avoid eye contact? Then you might have anxiety, they say. Do you feel disconnected from the world around you? Or are there multiple living beings inside your one body that you can’t control? Then it could be dissociation, dissociative identity disorder, or maybe bipolar disorder, according to the videos. As mental health awareness improves, there comes a troubling trend of young people diagnosing themselves with a mental illness, which can be a mood, personality, or anxiety disorder, but can also range to disabilities like autism or Tourette’s. And while some may relish finally being able to relate to feelings that they’re having, others might be creating new problems in their own minds. This is mental illness and disability appropriation: the perfect marriage between the rise in mental health awareness in the midst of an 18-month–long pandemic and the unabating teenage desire to be different and unique. Mental health has never been so openly discussed. And a lot of this is driven by a generational shift. Generation Z faced school closures, fragmented social structures, and increased levels of depression and anxiety, which all came along with a period of isolation that kept them glued to their phones. A recent survey by Mental Health America found that 54% of kids between the ages of 11 and 17 reported frequent suicidal thoughts or self-harm in the previous two weeks—the highest rate since it began screening in 2014.   Mental illness had the perfect breeding ground in which to propagate. As a result, people went online to vent, and mental health–related content on places like TikTok took off—providing a sense of community and belonging to people suffering from these afflictions. People who have ADHD flocked under #ADHD to vent about the troubles of zoning out, their need to release sudden bursts of energy, or even how their lack of object permanence contributed to the challenges of managing clutter. Under #depressedtok, people posted videos of finally cleaning up their rooms after being too lethargic to deal with it for months. Using YouTube, Tiktok, and other social media as a tool for those with mental health issues is “brilliant” says Jessica Jayne, a YouTuber and spokesperson for Mind, a mental health charity based in the U.K. “It’s basically a peer support group online,” she says. And it is a good thing. Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, says people sharing their own experiences of mental health problems is “hugely important,” as it can prompt others “to share their own experiences, or seek help, especially if it’s someone high-profile.” However, she does warn that sharing mental health online is great—“as long as it’s made clear that it’s an individual’s personal experience, and doesn’t constitute medical advice or expertise.” The viral potential of mental health posts and the extolling of mental illness and disability has spurred on some fakery, which Marc Feldman in 2000 coined as “Munchausen by Internet.” It ranges from misinformation like TikTok’s “People who you didn’t know had autism,” making loose claims that Anthony Hopkins and Lionel Messi both suffer from the disability, to videos of people actively “having panic attacks” behind specially curated ring lights. One common culprit is Tourette’s, which has been in the limelight owing to the rising number of reports of people, especially female teenagers, “catching” the disorder after watching videos online. In March 2021, a letter to the British Medical Journal found the number of expected referrals for Tourette’s had doubled in the past few months and warned of a spike in tic disorders among teenage girls. The teenage girls reported they had increased their consumption of such videos prior to symptom onset as well as posted videos and information about their Tourette’s movements on social media sites. “They report that they gain peer support, recognition, and a sense of belonging from this exposure. This attention and support may be inadvertently reinforcing and maintaining symptoms,” the researchers wrote. Similar reports of rising cases were found in Texas and Alberta, Canada, which led an academic article to dub the phenomenon “a pandemic within a pandemic.” Self-diagnosing as a concept is dubious. People note that diagnosis of mental health disorders has historically been the privilege of white, upper-class people, so excluding someone from diagnosis is not only ableist but also classist, sexist and racist. Experts tend to agree. Weatherley of Mind says, “It’s really important if we’re using language like ‘self-diagnosis’ that we don’t downplay the valid and real experiences of people who aren’t able to access appropriate health care,” whether that’s because of cost, waiting lists, prejudice, or not being taken seriously. Feldman calls individuals with “Munchausen by Internet” both “troubling” and “troubled,” in Vice. People who claim to have a mental illness or disability are still suffering, although from a condition different from the one they adopt. He also said false claims subject actual sufferers to skepticism and condemnation. Some groups are out for blood. Subreddits like r/fakedisordercringe, which has long been dedicated to outing posers online, polices illnesses in a way that often verges on bullying and has led to doxxing—posting someone’s, often young kids’, private information online. The market is also trying to self-correct, with a number of mental health professionals going viral online to combat misinformation and educate young people about mental health. In the end, experts say, this phenomenon may be a positive sign of a culture more open to mental illness and disability. A problem like this can only occur at a time in which people are ready to talk openly about mental health."
Florida’s battle over mask mandates in school heads to appeals court,4614,"The battle over mask requirements to guard against coronavirus in Florida schools headed for a new legal phase Friday following an appeal by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of a judge's ruling that a blanket ban on mask mandates exceeds the state government's authority. The case heads next to the 15 judges on the 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee and could ultimately wind up in the state Supreme Court. The issue is whether the freshly minted Parents Bill of Rights law means parents have sole authority to decide if their child wears a mask or permits a school board to impose a broad mask requirement. Because that will likely take time, lawyers for parents challenging the ban on mask requirements want Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper to immediately lift an automatic stay that effectively allows the ban to continue to be enforced during the appeal. Plaintiff attorney Charles Gallagher said in a court filing that the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus makes it all the more important that school districts be permitted to decide student mask mandates for themselves. “If the automatic stay remains in place, defendants would be permitted during the duration of the appeal to enforce the executive order and freely expose students and school staff to increased risk of Delta variant infection, which is a continuing constitutional violation,” Gallagher wrote. “Compelling circumstances are clearly present here.” Cooper set a hearing for Wednesday morning on the parents' request that the stay be lifted. Jacob Oliva, public schools chancellor at the state Department of Education, said in a notice Thursday to local superintendents that “enforcement must cease if the stay is lifted.” Under the DeSantis executive order, state education officials have been seeking to penalize defiant school boards by withholding salaries of board members. As of Friday, 13 districts representing more than half of Florida's 2.8 million public school students had imposed mask mandates despite the governor's order that a parental opt-out must be included. Most have only an opt-out for medical reasons. The rebel districts showed no signs of backing down, with some hiring lawyers to defend their decisions that often came after raucous public meetings pitting pro-and anti-mask parents against each other. Alachua County school Superintendent Carlee Simon, like others, insisted a mask mandate is permitted under the Parents Bill of Rights. The judge's ruling against the DeSantis order, she said in a statement, “confirms what we’ve said all along, which is that our mask mandate does not violate Florida law.” DeSantis, who is gearing up for a 2022 re-election campaign and a possible 2024 presidential run, has dismissed the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people generally wear masks to prevent coronavirus spread in certain situations. In particular, he contends that masks are less essential for young people and carry some risks of their own for children. At a news conference Friday in Pensacola, DeSantis said he opposes broad government or business mandates on masks or anything else related to the coronavirus pandemic. He did not directly address the school mask debate. “We've got to protect people's ability to live their lives,” DeSantis said. “My philosophy is, as a governor, my job is to protect your individual freedom.” The governor's appeal came Thursday night after Cooper issued a written version of his order delivered orally last week. The judge found that the Parents Bill of Rights law exempts government actions that are needed to protect public health and are reasonable and limited in scope—such as masking students to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. In fact, Cooper wrote that the DeSantis order on school masks itself violates the Parents Bill of Rights by illegally constraining the actions of school boards. “This statute does not support a statewide order or action interfering with the constitutionally provided authority of local school districts to provide for the safety and health of the children based on the unique facts on the ground in a particular county,” Cooper wrote. In addition, the judge said school boards must be afforded a chance to contest any penalties levied against them for adopting a student mask mandate. The appeals court did not immediately indicate when it would take up the governor's appeal, which first must be filed in a full written document. The action taken Thursday night was a notice to the court that a detailed appeal of Cooper's order is coming."
Google and Apple stand accused of interfering in Russian politics,666,"This is the web version of CEO Daily, a daily newsletter of must-read insights from Fortune CEO Alan Murray. Sign up to get it delivered free to your inbox. Good morning. David Meyer here in Berlin, filling in for Alan. Big Tech's Russian travails are sometimes quite nuanced. When the Russian information regulator Roskomnadzor threatened to fine Twitter earlier this year, for example, the illegal posts it was complaining about were partly of the sort that are illegal in most countries. Yes, the move came in a broader context of online repression within Russia, but the implications of this episode itself were at least somewhat debatable in the global context."
There have been 154 retracted COVID studies. The damage may already be done,617,"Happy Thursday, readers. If a COVID study is retracted from a medical journal, does it make a sound—or at the very least seep into the public consciousness the way the now-pulled research originally did? It's a rhetorical question (public awareness of study findings tend to stop at a retraction's edge, unfortunately). But I ask it because as of September 1, Retraction Watch has tagged 154 retracted COVID-19 papers. And if longstanding evidence is any indication, very few of them will receive the level of traditional and social media play after they've been discredited than they did prior to an academic rebuke."
Why South Africa’s COVID outbreak is raising alarms,170,"As COVID spreads rapidly in South Africa, researchers have identified a new COVID-19 variant, as the country struggles to get enough vaccines to inoculate its population."
"The psychology behind why people will take horse paste, but not COVID vaccines",390,"Say you're in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic. To protect yourself, you have a choice between vaccines that were tested on tens of thousands of people in rigorous clinical trials specifically for the purpose of combating COVID-19, or a decades-old drug like ivermectin that is most commonly known as a powerful parasite fighting treatment, often used for horses and livestock."
These states have the highest levels of COVID-19 vaccine refusal,1596,"Even as the Delta variant causes hospital intensive care units to fill to capacity, there’s strong resistance in some states to getting a COVID-19 vaccine. And a new poll from Morning Consult has ranked the ones where skepticism is the highest. Nationally, there’s still notable resistance among 30% of the population, according to the study. And while skepticism has shifted downward since March across all demographics, it’s still prevalent among the American population. Morning Consult spoke with an average of 3,334 adults per state between July 24 and Aug. 23. Resistance levels in states that are in the midst of major breakouts haven’t changed much. The rate of people unwilling to get vaccinated in Florida and Georgia, for example, did not change between June and August (19% and 24%, respectively). Florida, though, is not even one of the top 10 states with the highest rates of people unwilling to get the vaccine. South Dakota, where 33% of the respondents refuse to get jabbed, had the greatest proportion. Here’s how the ranking of vaccine unwillingness shook out: Chief reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are concerns about side effects and fears that the clinical trials moved too fast. Vaccine opposition is highest among Republicans and young adults, Morning Consult said. Some 26% of Republicans surveyed said they were unwilling to be vaccinated, while 24% of people between 18 and 34 said they would not. (Among GOP women, the unwilling rate jumped to 30%.) Vaccine opposition is lowest in the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, according to the poll."
Employers may reconsider moving to Texas due to new abortion law,6719,"In the past decade, Texas attracted almost 4 million people and a cavalcade of employers thanks to low taxes, lax regulation and thriving cities. But a defiant attitude toward COVID restrictions, new limits on voting access and now the nation’s strictest abortion law could undermine its appeal for future moves.  Companies including Apple Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. have moved operations and college-educated, creative-class workers to Texas in recent years; enclaves like Austin and Houston’s Montrose neighborhood felt a little like San Francisco with withering humidity. Now, those workers find themselves in a state taking far-right stances in a culture war with national ramifications for women’s autonomy and presidential politics. “Other states are competing for people,” said Tammi Wallace, chief executive officer of the Greater Houston LGBT Chamber of Commerce. “If you look at what our state is doing, and then you see another state where they’re not doing some of those things, you might say, ‘Well, the money’s good, but where do I want to raise my family?’” In a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to block a new Texas law outlawing most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The measure, which took effect Wednesday, is the tightest restriction in the nation.  No major companies spoke Wednesday about the law. But Bumble Inc., an online dating application based in the Texas capital of Austin, said on Instagram Wednesday night that it had created “a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in Texas.”  The state now outlaws most abortions during the sixth week, before many women know they are pregnant. Challengers told the court that the measure would prohibit abortions for at least 85% of the women seeking one in the country’s second-most populous state.  The law’s enforcement mechanism lets private parties sue a clinic or anyone who helps a woman get an abortion, but doesn’t authorize government officials to sue alleged violators. Supporters of abortion access say that’s a way to skirt the high court’s Roe v. Wade decision—which stemmed from a Texas case—guaranteeing a right to the procedure. They fear it could become a national template.  “The Supreme Court has ignored 50 years of precedent by allowing abortion to become nearly impossible for patients to access in Texas,” Planned Parenthood said in a tweet Thursday. “The impact of this heinous abortion ban cannot be understated. We’ll never stop fighting to get our patients the care they need.” Support for legal abortion is greater among those with more education, according to a Pew Research Center poll this spring. About 50% of those who completed high school or less support legal abortion, compared with about 71% of those with postgraduate degrees. Those are the workers Texas has been attracting.  Companies have played a major role in the politics of the Donald Trump era and its aftermath, as Republican governors have tried to court the ex-president’s loyalists, many of whom refuse to accept the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election and spurn public health measures. Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta after Georgia enacted restrictions on voting. In Florida, cruise lines have sparred with Governor Ron DeSantis over coronavirus vaccine mandates.   Several firms issued statements Wednesday condemning the Texas voting bill passed the evening before, which would prohibit many local policies established to aid voting during the pandemic. Critics say its aim is to depress the Democratic vote, particularly in heavily diverse cities such as Houston. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has promised to sign the measure in the name of ballot security, and backers have said it actually makes voting easier.  Many major employers took a different view.  “The new Texas voting law restricts rather than expands access to voting,” said Anna Walker, vice president of public affairs for Levi Strauss & Co. The San Francisco company has stores in the state, and Walker said it would “continue to make sure all our U.S. employees are aware of changing voting laws and how that impacts where and how they vote, supporting them and their communities in their efforts to fully participate in our democracy.” The bill puts an end to drive-thru voting, further curbs an already restricted mail-in voting program and empowers partisan poll watchers. The measure had already prompted a backlash earlier this year from major companies such as HP Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Fort Worth-based American Airlines Group Inc. We “oppose any changes that would restrict eligible voters’ access to the ballot,” the businesses said in a statement in May. “Freedom is preserved in our democracy when we hold free and fair elections that protect the fundamental rights of all Texans.” HP said Wednesday it would continue to support reforms that make it possible for more people to vote.  A spokesman for Apple said the company would have no comment. Toyota and Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Abbott’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday. In a prepared statement, he called the session that produced the voting bill “a monumental success.” In May, he said the abortion law “ensures the life of every unborn child with a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion.” The elections bill, the abortion law, friction over transgender issues and school curriculum all add up, said Ray Perryman, a former economist at Baylor University in Waco who has been tracking the Texas economy for 40 years. “Knowledge workers are overwhelmingly opposed to this sort of thing, and they are the single biggest resource for high growth companies,” Perryman said. Abbott and his predecessor as governor, Rick Perry, have for years been aggressively courting companies from other states, particularly California, initially with little to show for it. But Tesla now has a new factory under construction in Austin, among other successes. Texas’s ruling conservatives—no Democrat has been elected to statewide office since the early 1990s—have often been at odds with transplants from places like California, and with the state’s diverse cities. District lines have diluted votes from Houston, Austin and Dallas, which all have Democratic leaders, and empowered rural conservatives.   The Legislature has remained firmly in Republican control as have the two U.S. Senate seats. The state will gain two U.S. House seats after redistricting this year, and the process may solidify party control in Austin.  —With assistance from Jordyn Holman, Ian King, Dina Bass, Mark Gurman, Greg Stohr and Dana Hull."
Hospitals faced a surge in non-COVID infections in 2020,2966,"U.S. hospitals faced a surge in many other kinds of infections as COVID-19 taxed health care capacity across the country last year, according to a new report from federal researchers. Four types of health care infections commonly tracked as core measures of hospital quality increased significantly in 2020, compared with what would have been expected based on prior years’ rates, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in a journal article Thursday. The increases show how the pandemic’s strain on hospitals rippled into other aspects of caring for patients. During COVID surges, facilities often stretched the limits of their staff, equipment and bed space—conditions that returned in some states during this summer’s wave. At the time, experts cautioned that the crisis conditions—reusing some personal protective equipment, improvising new intensive-care beds, assigning more patients to each nurse—would have consequences on quality of care. “Hospitals saw a large influx of really critically ill patients, many of whom had what we already know of to be risk factors for these very infections,” said David Calfee, an infectious disease physician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. “We had severe reduction in resources in both supplies as well as staff.”  The pandemic conditions likely affected other measures of health care quality as well, said Calfee, who studies hospital infections. The health care industry has been trying to improve hospital safety for decades and reduce the rate at which patients contract infections in medical settings. Infection rates, sometimes linked to hospital reimbursements by the government, had been declining for years before the pandemic. Three types of infections linked to equipment attached to patients, like catheters and ventilators, rose sharply last year, according to the CDC report published in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology. The fourth was a measure of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as MRSA. Some of the increases were large: Infections associated with central lines used to deliver medication to patients jumped by about 47% in the second half of 2020 compared with the year before. Two other types of infections, associated with surgical sites and a illness known as C. diff, didn’t increase. The CDC researchers evaluated standardized infection rates that took into account changes in the number of patients in different periods. The data reinforce the need to adhere to infection-control practices even in times of crisis. “Basic infection control practices must be hardwired into practice so that they are less vulnerable when the health care system is stressed,” researchers from the National Institutes of Health wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. “It is upon us to learn from it and to get better because of it,” said Calfee, who edits the journal in which the findings were published but wasn’t involved in the research."
Paid family and medical leave is a civil right,5311,"My wife Danielle and I are expecting our first child this fall. We couldn’t be more excited or grateful to grow our family and welcome our son to the world. The way we’ve started stockpiling diapers, onesies, and gadgets I don’t even understand probably makes us look straight out of a sitcom. And as we prepare for a fundamental change to our world, we recognize with a great deal of humility our privilege to afford the basic necessities (and plenty of non-necessities) that seem to arrive at our apartment every day. We also recognize the privilege that both of us will be able to take ample time away when our son is born and maximize our bonding time with him. Danielle works in financial services and I’m the founder and CEO of a financial technology company. Both of our workplaces have generous family and medical leave policies, offering more than 3 months of paid parental leave. And while that may be increasingly the norm for corporate America, it’s the exception for many workers—and especially for the majority of Black Americans like us.  Days after my mother took me home from the hospital, she was back to working. In my hometown of Baton Rouge, paid leave wasn’t even a term people were familiar with for new mothers, let alone for new fathers. And when you’re living paycheck to paycheck, even a few extra days to care for a newborn or recover from childbirth can be financially impossible.  While paid family and medical leave policies have been steadily embraced by more white-collar employers, essential industries such as education, health, transportation, and hospitality are among the least likely to offer adequate paid leave. This is yet another example of the wealth and racial opportunity gap in America expanding, rather than contracting. Because blue collar employers are more likely to employ women, people of color, and low-wage earners, the very individuals who most need paid family and medical leave are the least likely to have access to it. In fact, 44% of workers don’t even have the option of taking unpaid leave, even if they can afford it, because the Family Medical Leave Act excludes many types of work. This particularly impacts Black Americans, who are 83% less likely than white Americans to be able to take leave when they need it.  It’s heartbreaking that the situation hasn’t meaningfully improved from my parent’s generation to mine. The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn’t offer a federal paid leave policy, which is lose-lose for employers and employees alike. Companies are forced to make decisions that have a massive impact on the health and well-being of all Americans, and individuals are forced to make impossible choices between family, health, and financial survival.  This is a clear opportunity for equitable public policy that can improve public health and help close the racial wealth gap. Right now, legislation to create a federal guarantee of 12 weeks paid family and medical leave is working its way through Congress with the support of the White House. I’m proud that my company, Cadre, which levels the playing field for investors, also helps level the playing field for our team by offering an equitable leave policy. Now we need to get this critical legislation to the finish line. My company and many others understand that paid leave is not only the morally right thing to do, it’s also good for business. The Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress reports that employees who are forced to take unpaid leave often don’t return to their jobs, and all of us who are engaged in hiring talent know that replacing talent is far more expensive than the cost of paid leave.  As we work toward a national paid leave program, companies should consider it a floor, not a ceiling. The private sector can add a layer of flexibility on top of what the government mandates, and that’s essential because every family’s circumstances are different. For example, I realize that my job running a tech company won’t allow me to fully disengage for an extended period of time, and that’s okay. Danielle and I are actively thinking through a plan that will allow each of us to find the time we need to care for our son and support each other, recognizing that the demands of our respective jobs won’t completely disappear. After we get through the first days after bringing our baby home, we’ll plan check-ins with our offices around his nap schedule (and I imagine I’ll probably be guilty of sometimes taking a call while feeding him). And the arrival of a baby is just the start. We also need to recognize how many family moments can come up unexpectedly, like a sick kid, a childcare challenge, or an elderly parent in need of care.  There’s no perfect or one-size-fits-all solution or blanket policy for every parent, caregiver or family. But what we know beyond any doubt (especially in light of the challenges we have faced over the past year) is that time to bond and acclimate—and recover in the case of new mothers—is essential to the physical and emotional health of our nation. This shouldn’t be a privilege for those who are fortunate enough to have a certain kind of job. It needs to be a right for all of us.  Ryan Williams is founder and CEO of the real estate investing technology platform Cadre."
Scientists to rich nations: COVID booster shots are ‘criminal’ and counterproductive,4909,"“Shocking” and “criminal” are not usually words medical specialists use when discussing a global pandemic. But in recent days, some of the world’s top experts on COVID-19 have erupted in anger as the U.S., some European Union countries, and Israel roll out plans for vaccine booster shots—programs that infectious-disease experts warn could leave poor countries with deep shortfalls of doses, prolong the pandemic, and potentially spawn more dangerous coronavirus variants. “We do not want to see widespread use of boosters for healthy people who are fully vaccinated,” the World Health Organization’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Berlin on Wednesday, repeating the WHO’s earlier call for countries to delay their third-jab plans until next month, so that poor countries could work to catch up in their inadequately supplied vaccination programs. “We still see shocking inequities in access to vaccines,” Dr. Tedros said. Plans for booster shots have roiled the scientific community and governments around the world, as questions mount over how rich countries have been able to hoard excess vaccine doses while dozens of poor countries struggle to immunize more than a tiny percentage of people. In just one example, the decision by U.S. authorities to start administering booster shots to millions of Americans beginning later this month reportedly prompted two top vaccine officials of the Food and Drug Administration to quit in protest on Tuesday. In this highly combustable situation, vaccine manufacturers have made moves to increase production of COVID-19 doses—but in many cases for booster shots. Pfizer has applied to the FDA for approval for its booster shot, marketed under the name Comirnaty, and in Europe, the European Medicines Agency last month approved two new Pfizer-BioNTech sites, in France and Germany, to manufacture booster shots. Moderna is scaling up production in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. If anything, the deep divide between rich and poor countries has grown when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. About 75% of the world’s 5 billion vaccine doses so far have been administered in just 10 rich countries—a schism that could cost the global economy up to $2.3 trillion by 2023, according to a report last week by the Economist Intelligence Unit. In France, for example, about 65.6% of the country’s 66 million are now fully vaccinated, after a major summer campaign to boost immunization rates. By comparison, a minuscule 2% of Africa’s 1.2 billion people are fully vaccinated. Even so, on Wednesday France became the first EU country to offer third-dose booster shots to anyone over 65—a program that even the EU’s own infectious-disease agency said on Wednesday was unnecessary. In July, Israel, where 60% of people are double-vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, became the first country to administer booster shots, which they offer to anyone over 60. Those programs have ignited fierce criticism from leading scientists, who say the booster shots directly impact the vaccines available for poorer countries. “You’re dealing with a finite, zero-sum resource,” renowned epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the WHO, told Science magazine last week. “You are reducing supply for those who need it more.” Tulio de Oliveira, a biologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, told the magazine that the booster shots were “unfair to say the least, potentially…even criminal.” Booster shots might also be medically unnecessary, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. In a report on Wednesday, the EU agency said “there is no urgent need” for booster shots, unless people are in frail health. It said that people have apparently forgotten the purpose of vaccines: to prevent hospitalization and death. In that, the report says, two COVID-19 vaccine doses are “currently highly protective.” Yet try telling that to regular citizens in rich countries like France, where COVID-19 vaccine doses are plentiful, given at local pharmacies or vaccination centers, and free of charge. French President Emmanuel Macron drove a massive push to vaccinate the country after a sluggish start to its vaccine program last December—even mandating proof of full vaccination to enter restaurants and bars, museums, movie theaters, and shopping centers. For many French, there seems no reason why not to receive a third jab. “When you’re in good health and people around you are in good health, that’s what matters,” Bernard Weill, 68, CEO of the French clothing company Weill, told the Associated Press on Wednesday, sitting in a pharmacy in Paris’s Right Bank district, where he rushed to get his booster shot on the first day it was available. The vaccine jabs, he said, were “nothing to worry about and nothing to care about.” Nothing to worry about, that is, for rich countries, and at least for now."

Joe Rogan’s highly questionable ivermectin COVID-19 ‘cure’ may be lethal. It’s also catching on around the world,2998,"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic pill mainly used to deworm horses and cows. It is also, according to podcast star Joe Rogan, a great way to treat COVID-19. Even before the endorsement from Rogan, who recently came down with COVID-19 and treated it with a cocktail of drugs unproven to be effective against the illness, ivermectin had been growing in popularity. In places like Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and South Africa—along with the U.S.—people were using it to self-medicate against COVID-19. Google searches for ivermectin are at an all-time high. Searches for ivermectin jumped alongside other at-home remedies like “hydroxychloroquine” at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, but while the Trump-backed hydroxychloroquine fell out of favor, ivermectin maintained its popularity. Prescriptions for ivermectin jumped to more than 88,000 in the week ended Aug. 13, and some pharmacists have even reported shortages of the drug. But as with many unproven medicines, it can have fatal consequences. Calls to poison control centers about ivermectin exposures have risen fivefold over the baseline in July, according to CDC researchers who used data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Mississippi’s health department even issued an alert in August saying 70% of recent calls to the state poison control center had come from people who over-ingested ivermectin from livestock supply stores. Such dangerous effects from self-prescription have prompted Merck, the manufacturer of the drug, to come out and say there was no scientific basis for ivermectin to be used as treatment against COVID-19 and the Food and Drug Administration to caution against ingestion of the medicine, warning that “using the drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19 can be dangerous and even lethal.” Beyond ivermectin’s potential dangers, the drug also appears to offer little benefit in the fight against COVID. Researchers looking into the efficacy of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment had to shut down a large 1,300 patient trial because the drug had been no better than a placebo at preventing hospitalizations. Dr. Edward Mills, a professor at McMaster University who led the study, noted the team would have discontinued it earlier were it not for the level of public interest in ivermectin. Researchers and physicians are particularly worried by people who are seeking out ivermectin to prevent COVID-19 in lieu of getting a vaccine. But this has not stopped Rogan, the popular podcast host who has already been in hot water for suggesting young, fit people don’t need to get the COVID-19 vaccine. After announcing a few canceled tour dates owing to his illness, Rogan gave a shout-out to the medicine, saying “a wonderful, heartfelt thank you to modern medicine for pulling me out of this so quickly and so easily.” Instagram captioned his post with a short warning: “Some unapproved COVID-19 treatments may cause serious harm.” Facebook, owner of Instagram, did not respond to requests for comment."
Most Americans are comfortable returning to the office regardless of coworkers’ vaccination status,297,"About 64% of U.S. adults are vaccinated, but when it comes to return-to-the-office plans, workers say vaccine status doesn’t matter that much.  About 72% of Americans are currently comfortable returning to work, according to a recent Harris poll of over 1,100 U.S. workers fielded in August 2021. "

China Curbing Healthcare Ads on Baidu After Student’s Death,642,"Chinese regulators imposed limits on the lucrative healthcare adverts carried by Baidu on Monday following the death of a student who underwent experimental cancer treatment he found via China’s biggest search engine. Baidu’s shares fell by 5% in pre-market trading in New York following the move, as healthcare provides 20 to 30% of the company’s search revenue, analysts at Nomura and Daiwa said. Search revenues represented some 84% of the firm’s total sales in 2015. Baidu shares have fallen since the controversy over the death of student Wei Zexi erupted at the start of the month and had lost 10.5% of their value by last week’s close."
HBO’s John Oliver Just Debunked Most of the Scientific Studies You’ve Heard About,868,"On Mother’s Day, John Oliver delivered the mother of all scientific mockeries. His aim: to debunk the type of “studies” typically cited on morning talk shows such as NBC’s Today that purport to challenge conventional medical wisdom with surprising new data. Illustrating how such information gets blown out of proportion by a revved-up news cycle that thrives on out-of-context and unconfirmed breakthroughs of limited scientific merit, the host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight delivered a trash-talking civics lesson as a comedy of errors. “There are so many studies being thrown around, they can seem to contradict one another,” Oliver said Sunday. “In just the last few months, we’ve seen studies about coffee that claim it may reverse the effects of liver damage, help prevent colon cancer, decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and increase the risk of miscarriage.”"
Decades of Studies Show What Happens to Marriages After Having Kids,886,"This article was originally published on The Conversation. Lots of women look forward to motherhood – getting to know a tiny baby, raising a growing child, developing a relationship with a maturing son or daughter. All over the world, people believe that parenting is the most rewarding part of life. And it’s good that so many mothers treasure that bond with their child, because the transition to parenthood causes profound changes in a woman’s marriage and her overall happiness… and not for the better. Families usually welcome a baby to the mix with great expectations. But as a mother’s bond with a child grows, it’s likely that her other relationships are deteriorating. I surveyed decades of studies on the psychological effects of having a child to write my book “Great Myths of Intimate Relationships: Dating, Sex, and Marriage,” and here’s what the research literature shows."

UPS Backing a Startup That Will Use Drones to Deliver Blood in Rwanda,715,"International delivery company UPS is backing a start-up using drones in Rwanda to transport life-saving blood supplies and vaccines, underlining the wide potential for the unmanned aircraft and helping bring package delivery by drone to U.S. consumers a step closer. U.S. companies are keen to use drones to cut delivery times and costs but hurdles range from smoothing communication between the autonomous robots and airplanes in America’s crowded airspace to ensuring battery safety and longevity. As far back as 2013, online retailer Amazon (AMZN) said it was testing delivery using drones and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL) has promised such a service by 2017. Leading retailer Walmart (WMT) is also testing drones."
Gates Foundation to Grant $38 Million for Low-Cost Polio Vaccine,703,"Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceuticals is to get $38 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a crucial, low-cost polio vaccine for use in developing countries. As part of a global plan to eradicate the crippling disease, of which experts say the world could see the last case this year, countries will need to switch from using oral polio vaccine (OPV) to using so-called inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to ensure the disease does not reappear. Experts fear a substantial worldwide shortage of IPV once every country in the world is ready to make the switch, and polio eradication strategists have been looking at how to avert that shortfall by encouraging new manufacturers into the sector."

OxyContin’s 12-Hour Dosing Claim Attacked In Massive Investigation,1022,"America is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. Since 1999, more than 165,000 people have died from overdosing on prescription painkillers; opioids have even been implicated in the death of superstar Prince. Now, an extensive new investigative report by the Los Angeles Times puts Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid OxyContin, under the microscope, questioning whether the drug’s branding helped fuel the scourge ravaging the country. Purdue has already faced plenty of scrutiny from the government and others over its promotional tactics for OxyContin, as Stat News notes. In fact, three Purdue executives plead guilty to charges of misleading marketing for the drug and were forced to pay more than $600 million in fines. And in December, Purdue settled a lawsuit from the state of Kentucky, which charged that the company misled the public about the addictiveness of the drug. But the new Los Angeles Times investigation raises alarming questions about the firm’s dosing claims and their connection to the epidemic."

Diabetes ‘Unicorn’ Intarcia Hits Major Milestone,949,"Intarcia Therapeutics today will announce that it has cleared the last major clinical hurdle for what could become a revolutionary new treatment for patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes, and that it will file for FDA approval by the end of next quarter. It also has raised $75 million in new debt financing to begin ramping up manufacturing, so that it will have adequate inventory if and when it is allowed by begin selling its product in late 2017. But what the Boston-based company, most recently valued at $5.5 billion by private investors, still refuses to do is become publicly traded. Most biotech startups attempt to IPO (or be acquired) early in the life of their clinical trials, primarily because such testing is capital-intensive. Intarcia, however, has managed to raise more than $1 billion from venture capitalists and other private-market investors, arguing that a pre-commercialization IPO would leave too much value on the table."
Merck CEO: We’re on the Hunt for Deals in 2016,734,"Merck (MRK) CEO Ken Frazier on Thursday emphasized his company’s desire to close significant acquisition and licensing deals this year during an earnings call with investors and reporters. “You haven’t seen the deals come through quite yet, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not very, very much engaged in active discussions with” a number of companies, he said. The U.S.-based drug giant’s quarterly financial report fell just short of analysts’ revenue expectations despite an impressive haul from new drugs like the cancer immunotherapy blockbuster Keytruda. The slight miss was largely attributed to a difficult sales landscape for some older medications. Merck had revenues of $9.31 billion in Q1 2016, a 1.2% year-over-year drop."

Here’s How to Turn Your Smartphone Into a Life-Saving Device,789,"These days, we increasingly turn to our smartphones whenever we need anything—including help in a crisis. But when it comes to responding to an emergency, technology still has a long way to go. Earlier this year, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study that found that voice-assistant systems like Siri and Cortana responded inconsistently and incompletely to traumatic situations. So, if you need help in a hurry, can your phone do anything but dial 911? Nancy Lublin, who founded Dress for Success and ran the volunteer organization DoSomething.org, says there is another option. Users who text 741-741 will reach her latest endeavor, the Crisis Text Line. The volunteer counseling service has processed over 14 million messages since Lublin founded it in 2013."
"Why Smart, Successful People Don’t Value Happiness Enough",585,"Suppose a magic genie appeared on your desk right now and offered to grant you three wishes. What would you ask for? With smarty-pants answers like “I wish for an infinite number of future wishes” ruled out, the thousands of research subjects who have taken this simple quiz have mostly come up with the answers you’d expect, like wealth, fame, health, true love, career success, and power. But here’s a surprise: Despite the fact that happiness ranks high on most people’s lists of what they want from life (often in the No. 1 spot), almost no one ever asks the genie for it. Why not?"
Non-Smokers Are Footing the Bill For Smokers’ Health Insurance,258,"When smokers don’t tell insurers about their bad habit, non-smokers pay.

Is Digital Health Finally About to Turn All That Hype Into Results?,1062,"Last week, tech behemoth Apple (AAPL) announced the launch of a spate of health apps linked to its new CareKit developer tool set, including programs for monitoring depression (Iodine’s Start app), pregnancy and maternity (Glow’s Nurture and Baby apps), and diabetes (One Drop’s eponymous application). It’s part of a concerted effort by a bevy of mainstay technology companies and startups to personalize healthcare by leveraging the power of self-tracked data and, in CareKit’s case, a centralized terminal which brings together individuals, patient communities, caretakers, and medical professionals to track symptoms, medication use, and other care information. For all the hoopla and hype, though, the promise of these ostensibly “disruptive” technologies has yet to translate into quantifiable results such as improved health, fewer hospital admissions, or reduced healthcare spending. There are some legitimate reasons for that, including the obvious caveat that many mobile health platforms are fledgling creations which need more time to make an impact."
FBI Arrest Man Suspected of Spraying Mice Poison on Whole Foods Products,782,"A man suspected of contaminating open food bars at three Ann Arbor, Mich. grocery stores including Whole Foods Market (WFM), was taken into custody Tuesday, after authorities received tips from the public. The suspect allegedly sprayed a combination of hand cleaner, water, and Tomcat mice poison on produce in Whole Foods, Meijer, and Plum Market in Ann Arbor over the past two weeks—though authorities are trying to determine if the suspect targeted any other grocery stores. “Investigators are currently coordinating with state of Michigan and Washtenaw County Health Officials to determine the extent of any contamination and the threat to the public,” the FBI’s Detroit team wrote in a statement. The FBI worked jointly with the Ann Arbor Police Department to find the suspect."
The Selfie Generation Has Makeup Companies Rethinking Their Strategies,771,"The selfie has been held up as the exemplar of vanity in the millennial generation, and now all that self-absorption is forcing cosmetic companies to think about a makeover. Instead of buying more expensive products such as anti-aging creams (which women are often encouraged to begin using in their 20s), young consumers are now buying masks, foundations, and other products that bring instant gratification to the Instagram generation. “The 30-year-old today gets more photographs of themselves in a day than their mother did in a year, so they care about what their skin looks like now, not when they are 40,” said Estée Lauder (EL) CEO Fabrizio Freda in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, after the cosmetics giant posted solid third-quarter earnings Tuesday."
Kids Love the American Girl Doll Diabetes Kit,783,"Having Type 1 diabetes means counting carbs, pricking fingers, and receiving routine insulin infusions. For kids with the disease, it’s not exactly fun. But American Girl is making it a bit more bearable with a diabetes care kit for dolls. The $24 accessory comes with 10 items that kids with Type 1 diabetes are all too familiar with including a blood sugar monitor, insulin pump and injection pen needle, glucose tablets, medical bracelet, and lancing device. According to the New York Times, this addition to the AG accessory arsenal can be attributed to 13-year-old Anja Busse. After she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes about two and a half years ago, she circulated a petition asking the doll makers to create diabetes-related accessories. It received about 7,000 signatures."
