"The Struggle to Vaccinate Springfield, Missouri",13858,"On February 18th, deep in a deadly covid-19 winter at Cox Medical Center South, in Springfield, Missouri, the last patient was moved from the treatment ward they called the Tower, a large shell space hurriedly outfitted with beds, I.V. poles, oxygen, and beeping monitors. Hospitalizations were declining rapidly, and much of the front-line medical corps had access to vaccines that would soon be available to millions of Americans. In the empty Tower, nurses giddily removed their protective masks and gowns, and laughed and danced, mimicking the moves from Pharrell Williams’s “Happy.” Soon, Kali Blair, a nurse at Cox South, was referring to covid in the past tense. “We were just really hopeful,” she said the other day, four floors down from the Tower, where dozens of new patients were severely ill. “I feel like some of us have lost that hope now.” Seventeen months ago, Blair raised her hand to volunteer when the CoxHealth hospital system admitted its first covid patients. When the initial covid crush arrived, it swept her into a realm that required extraordinary strength and resilience. As patients neared death and relatives were unable to be with them, Blair often shared the final moments with families via video call. “Can we sing something? Do you want me to stroke their hair? Do you want me to hold their hand?” she recalled asking them. “Of course, you’re wearing a mask yourself, and you can’t wipe your eyes, and there’s tears.” And now, to her frustration, those times are back. On a single day in July, she told six different families that there was nothing left to do to save their loved ones. When I met Blair last month, Springfield’s covid hospitalization numbers were rising; they soon topped their winter peaks. She had worked eight twelve-hour covid shifts in the previous two weeks, many of them in the Tower, which was open again and nearing capacity. I asked her to describe her days there. “It’s generally very loud in there,” she said. “Alarms are going off. A patient wailing or screaming or yelling. It’s just kind of complete chaos.” It’s crowded. It can take a half-dozen or more staff members to insert a breathing tube. Blue tarps fastened to frames of PVC pipe separate beds that stretch in long rows. For sick patients being wheeled onto the floor for the first time, the cacophony can induce panic. “We get asked by many patients, ‘Am I going to live? Am I going to make it out of here?’ ” Blair said. “You don’t know how to answer that question, because a lot of them don’t.” By a recent estimate, the Delta variant now accounts for eighty-three per cent of sequenced cases in the United States. It is not only more contagious than the original strain of covid-19, it is also more aggressive. “Sicker, younger, quicker,” Steve Edwards, the CoxHealth president, tweeted. Yet, Delta is eminently stoppable, and that’s the confounding thing for the health-care workers who must deal with the fallout. Though some uncertainty remains about the long-term prognosis of patients with breakthrough cases, the vaccines largely prevent serious illness. Since June 1st, CoxHealth has admitted nearly a thousand covid patients, roughly ninety-five per cent of them unvaccinated. In Greene County, where Springfield is located, fifty-six per cent of eligible residents have chosen not to get a shot. The numbers are even worse in surrounding counties. Blair said, “There’s people that will tell you on their deathbed, with their dying words, that covid’s not real, that this is all a conspiracy theory, this is a money-making scam. We really, truly do exhaust everything that we have in us to keep these patients alive. You already feel defeated, because most patients don’t make it. You feel a different kind of defeat, because you’re doing everything in your power to keep somebody alive, and they don’t believe in what you’re doing.” The results of newly urgent vaccination efforts have been mixed, as I learned when I visited the working-class neighborhood of Westside. On West Madison Street, I met Tommy Freshour, a long-retired travelling ironworker, whose well-tended gray beard reached halfway down his chest. Sixty-eight years old, a heavy smoker, his muscles weakened by multiple sclerosis, he had finally had his first shot, after local-television news captured his attention. His reasoning was simple: “I just got tired of being scared.” Freshour thinks that people have “started waking up,” but John Buck, who lives across the street, is not one of them. Buck, who is thirty-nine and works nights as a driver for an Amazon contractor, describes himself as “healthy as a horse.” He reasoned that he had grown up playing outside in the woods and that the immune system works like a muscle: “the more you exercise it, the better it works.” He doubts that six hundred thousand people have died of covid in the United States, and he considers mask rules “a government scare tactic to keep people under their thumb.” In case none of that made it clear, he said, “There is absolutely no need to expose myself to a vaccine I don’t need. You could offer me a million dollars, and I wouldn’t take it.” In conversations with patients and their families, nurses and doctors hear echoes of messages spread by mainstream conservative media outlets such as Fox News, talk radio, and Web sites that occupy the fringe. Two nurses told me that some patients were suspicious of retractable needles. After the nurses administered the shot, the syringe made a clicking sound, and the patients asked whether that was the sound of a microchip being implanted in their arms. In the hospitals, some patients still demand to know why doctors don’t treat them with hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial and immunosuppressant drug that was touted by Donald Trump and Fox News personalities but found to make no meaningful difference for covid patients. Blair recalled a patient who had been taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin—a typical treatment for parasitic worms. As his condition worsened, he belatedly went to the hospital, and was soon on a ventilator and a dialysis machine, with “very, very poor prognosis,” she said. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? In late July, the Biden Administration made ninety-eight million dollars available to rural health clinics—including a hundred and twenty-three clinics in Missouri—to build confidence in the vaccine. According to Xavier Becerra, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the money will support “trusted messengers,” whose mission will be “to counsel patients on how covid-19 vaccines can help protect them and their loved ones.” But, earlier in July, when President Biden suggested going “community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door” to spread information about vaccines, Republican politicians in Missouri erupted. The congressman Jason Smith, whose district is just east of Springfield, tweeted, “The Biden administration wants to knock down your door KGB-style to force people to get vaccinated. We must oppose forced vaccination!” In fact, the Springfield-Greene County Health Department has been knocking on residents’ doors for months to offer information about vaccines. On a Monday morning, two community-health advocates for the department, Annaliese Schroeder and Jordana Vera, allowed me to tag along as they visited residents on the city’s west side. If no one answered the door, and many didn’t, they left a door hanger with information about free vaccine clinics. “Walk-ins Welcome,” it read in bright yellow type. When someone did answer, Schroeder took a cheerful tone. She said to one resident, “We’re just spreading information that we’ve got two health clinics going on this week. Do you have any questions?” Most of the people who chatted with Schroeder and Vera had been vaccinated or had made appointments. One woman, seated in a cluttered garage, said that she could not get the vaccine for health reasons, but that she wanted her children, who were living at home and currently had covid, to be vaccinated as soon as they recovered. Rosalee Greninger said that she had scheduled a shot just the day before, at her daughter’s insistence. She had hesitated, she said, because “I’ve been feeling really good. Why go get a shot that makes you feel puny?” Larry Watson, wearing a Cheech and Chong T-shirt, had been vaccinated, even though an acquaintance at church had told him that the vaccine was “poison,” and one of his sons tried to talk him out of it. The Delta spike worries Watson, because few people in Springfield wear masks. “You just don’t know who’s gotten the shot,” he said. The health department has given shots at libraries, parks, churches, grocery stores, bars, the jail, and the zoo. At one brewpub, everyone who got vaccinated could claim a free beer. I met Jan Atwell, a registered nurse who came out of retirement to help, at a pop-up clinic held at a call center, where each person who was vaccinated received two tickets to see the Springfield Cardinals, the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. She told me that at a recent clinic at a fire station, she saw a pack of young men striding across the street to get their shots. They were Missouri State football players, who said that their coach had not required them to get the shot but had made clear what he wanted them to do. At the call-center clinic, the nurses administered only ten shots in two hours. One young worker strolled past and said to a friend, who was getting a shot, “You’re tripping, bro.” Lori Painter had been on the fence about getting the vaccine, but when she heard about the pop-up clinic, she signed up. She hoped that her decision would inspire her children to follow suit. Her teen-age daughter was reconsidering, she said, but one of her sons “listens too much to his dad,” who doesn’t believe that covid exists. Jennifer Ingram, who also works at the call center, was still nervous after receiving an injection. She scrolled through her phone, searching for reassuring Bible verses. Two of her seven siblings are apprehensive about the vaccine, saying that the rollout was too “rush-rush,” Ingram told me. She, too, was doubtful, but one day, she was listening to NPR and she heard Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, call the current surge a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” That, along with talking to a nurse she trusts, informed her decision. “It would be a help if I die tomorrow and not today, for my children,” she told me. Though many colleges across the country are mandating vaccination, Drury University, a liberal-arts college in Springfield, is relying on incentives. Students getting shots at Drury will be eligible for prizes such as a thousand-dollar tuition discount, iPads, campus parking permits, and a seat in the president’s suite for a home basketball game. If seventy per cent of students are vaccinated, Drury will add a day to fall vacation. Mike Brothers, the executive director of university relations, told me that the college had considered and rejected imposing a mandate. He noted that people who are from more rural communities, more politically conservative, and more evangelical are less likely to get the vaccine. “That is our area,” he said. In the end, covid surges always flow to hospitals, where health-care workers have little choice but to cope. But this time, the fact that the worst symptoms are almost entirely preventable casts an enduring shadow. “I would be dishonest if I said I wasn’t a little bit angry,” Tracy Hill, a nurse at Mercy Medical Center, told me, nine hours into a twelve-hour shift, her third in three days. “You remember Frogger, that video game?” she asked. “That’s how I feel people who are unvaccinated are. You’re running out in traffic every day trying to dodge the covid bus. And when you get hit, you end up on the other side of my mask.” The day before, an elderly patient, who had been in her care for weeks, called his significant other to say goodbye. “It was a fifteen-second conversation. I just think what that must feel like, to be that person on the other end of the phone,” Hill said. As she described the moment, she was sobbing. The man died a few hours later. Hill, who is fifty-two, began keeping a diary last year. She called it “My covid Journal.” During a particularly rough spell, she renamed it “My covid Is Killing Me Journal.” One of her siblings had cut off contact because Hill urged her relatives to wear masks. Her twenty-six-year-old daughter was suffering from long-haul symptoms; she had texted, seven months after coming down with covid, that she felt exhausted even after sleeping eighteen hours straight. The day we spoke, Hill had treated a panicked patient in his forties who had arrived at Mercy in such poor shape that he was intubated within fifteen minutes. She said that she would never forget the look he gave her. “Just the desperation in his eyes, pleading silently. He was squeezing my hand so tight.” Hill recalled that last winter, she was one of the first two people in Springfield to be vaccinated. “I couldn’t stop smiling,” she said. “I really, really thought this was the beginning of the end.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Immense Relief of Health-Care Workers Receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine,13681,"When Sam Foster, the chief nursing officer at Oxford University Hospitals, entered an I.C.U. ward for covid-19 patients for the first time, in April, she wore a long-sleeved gown, a plastic apron and hat, two pairs of gloves, rubber boots, and heavy-duty face protection that resembled a gas mask. The layers made her almost unrecognizable—her name was scrawled across her apron as an identifier—except for her eyes, which are hazel and unusually bright. “The doors opened, and it was like a spaceship,” she told me recently. “And I did think, Oh, god, what have I done?” Foster, who is forty-eight, oversees five thousand health-care workers across four hospitals in Oxfordshire. In the early days of the pandemic, many of them worked the I.C.U. in two-hour shifts, tagging in and out like runners in a relay. When they emerged, they would carefully remove and dispose of their P.P.E., type up their notes, eat something, and prepare to do it all again. The U.K. public was applauding health-care workers every Thursday night at 8 p.m., but the locals around Foster’s hospitals learned that the staff didn’t leave until 8:30, and adjusted accordingly. “They lined the street, and they were banging their pans and cheering us out,” she said. “Oh, god, it was amazing.” That was April. The eight months since have been gruelling and unrelenting. Foster’s hospitals were filled to capacity. The team lost several staff members to the virus; two colleagues passed away in a single weekend. For a few months, elective surgeries were paused. “Everything was focussed on covid,” Foster said. In May, Foster helped set up one of the U.K.’s Nightingale hospitals—vast, makeshift spaces for overflow coronavirus patients, which went largely unused. Soon after, she fell ill for a few days with mild flu-like symptoms. She didn’t take a coronavirus test at the time, but, in July, she was turned down for the Oxford vaccine trial because antibodies in her blood indicated that she had already had the virus. All through this time, she continued to work long days alongside her staff. For “most of us, it’s a life-style choice,” she said. “You’re never really off duty.” This month, Foster learned that her trust had been selected as one of fifty hospital hubs across the U.K. that would begin dispensing the first doses of the vaccine. Then, at the last minute, she learned that the hospital would be vaccinating many more patients than expected, across three regional areas. “We had about seventy-two hours to work it through,” she said. Nobody slept the night before the vaccine arrived. They went over their plans. “Have we got resuscitation? Anaphylaxis? All the clinical safety pieces? Are the communications right? Does everybody know their role?” Foster said. Since December 2nd, when Britain issued emergency approval for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, becoming the first Western country to do so, nurses, doctors, and hospital officials all over the U.K. have been scrambling to ramp up daily vaccinations. Joe Harrison, the chief executive at Milton Keynes University Hospital, not far from London, told me that the hospital has more positive patients now than it did during the first wave. On the day we spoke, they had one critical-care bed left available. “We’re effectively full,” he said. On Tuesday, December 8th, they began their vaccination drive, doling out a hundred and seventy-five doses. “We started off relatively slowly,” he said. “We didn’t know how long each of the steps in the process would take.” They are working toward the hub’s capacity, around seven hundred vaccinations per day. Iain Davidson, the chief pharmacist at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals N.H.S. Trust, a network of three hospitals at the far southwestern edge of the country, told me that his hub completed more than two hundred vaccinations on its first day, mostly care-home workers. (One home bused in around fifty staffers.) The day before vaccinations began, the nurses practiced preparing the vaccine with placebos. Each vial contains several doses, all of which must be used. “Every dose is so precious,” Davidson said. David Walliker, the chief digital and partnerships officer at Oxford University Hospitals, had been working to get the right patients scheduled for their shot on the first day of vaccinations, Tuesday, the 8th. On Monday night, “We sent a text message out to thirty patients between eighty years old and ninety-four,” he told me. Within two hours, more than twenty-five people had booked. Walliker had also been working with a small team to design the actual vaccination space, which occupies part of a top floor, normally reserved for teaching, at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford. (They chose the Churchill because it has a freezer cold enough to store the Pfizer vaccine.) There’s a room where patients check in, another where they’re vaccinated, and then “they’re sent to a third room, where they wait for fifteen minutes and have a cup of coffee and a biscuit to make sure they don’t have any adverse reactions to the injection.” Late Monday night, Walliker was still lugging chairs and setting up plastic shields. “It was all hands to deck to make sure we were ready,” he said. When the vaccine finally arrived, it came in a case that resembled a pizza box. “It’s like when the Coca-Cola van comes, you know—it’s here,” Foster told me, on a video call from the hospital. “Everybody knew it was here.” They stored it carefully in the ultra-cold freezer. On the first vaccination day, a small group of staffers gathered around a vial of the vaccine to learn how to make it ready for patients. “There were about eight or nine of us nurses, with some pharmacists, all looking at this tiny vial like we were all students, you know, in silence,” she said. When the inaugural patient, Nicholas Woodthorpe, arrived, Foster administered the first dose. “Just because I could,” she said, beaming. The vaccine has come at a grim time for Britain. Last week, surging cases in London pushed the capital into Tier 3 of coronavirus restrictions, closing pubs, restaurants, and theatres, and further limiting in-person gatherings. On Saturday, amid rising fears about a new, potentially more infectious version of the virus, the government announced that much of the South-East and East of England, including London, would move into Tier 4, effectively cancelling Christmas plans for millions. The hospitals are full again, and flu season is upon us. The National Health Service has advised hospitals to prioritize patients over eighty for the vaccine, followed by care-home workers, who have been among Britain’s hardest hit. Remaining shots were going to N.H.S. staff members, focussing on the clinically vulnerable, many of whom have been unable to work during the pandemic. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Some recipients received the vaccine because their roles in health care are exceptionally intimate. Barbara Lamb, a specialist nurse in the eye department at a hospital trust in Newcastle upon Tyne, received the vaccine on Tuesday, the 8th. Lamb’s work includes close-contact care for patients with glaucoma and other eye conditions, which puts her at increased risk. Lamb is sixty-eight and lives alone, though she takes care of her grandchildren a few times a week. She commutes to the hospital by bus. Now that winter has arrived, “It’s dark when I go to work in the morning; it’s dark when you come home,” she said. “It can be quite a lonely existence.” On the morning of her appointment, she learned that she would be the first of the nursing staff to be vaccinated. Her photograph was taken. “It was all quite surreal, really,” she told me. She’s looking forward to seeing her sister, who lives nearby, and to doing “things that we’ve taken for granted.” “Just to be able to go out without your mask on and to give relatives a hug,” she said. “To maybe call on someone you don’t see that often. At the moment, you have to just wave from across the road.” Stefan Chioariu, the deputy manager at Cecil Court, a care home in Kew, was one of the first people to receive the vaccine in London. Cecil Court used to have a slew of daily activities for its residents, including flower arranging, yoga classes, and live concerts. During the pandemic, everything has moved online, and visitors are banned inside the home. On Thursday, December 10th, Chioariu visited St. George’s Hospital for his shot, despite some lingering fears from his wife about side effects. “Social media has amplified things,” he said. At his appointment, he was given a leaflet that said the vaccine would not cause him to catch the virus, he said. “So that was kind of comforting.” Other recipients had serious underlying health conditions. Maia-Lisa Rand was one of the first to receive a vaccination at the Milton Keynes University Hospital hub two weeks ago. Rand has worked for the N.H.S. for forty years. She’s now a clinical site manager at Milton Keynes. When the U.K. government advised extremely vulnerable citizens to practice “shielding” early in the pandemic, Rand, who has a chronic lung condition, began working from home. She has been isolating away from her colleagues for several months, with a brief stint back at the hospital in the summer and early fall, when cases were down. “I was desperate to actually go back to work,” she told me. “I love my job.” On Monday, the 7th, she received an e-mail asking if she would like to get the vaccine. She scheduled one for Wednesday, at 8 a.m. (“I couldn’t book my appointment quick enough,” she said.) At the hospital, she reunited with co-workers she hadn’t seen in months. “In all, it took about forty minutes, and it was the best forty minutes I’ve spent,” she said. Hayley Smith and her husband, Jamie, connected in a clinic for patients with organ transplants years ago; they have each received a new kidney. Their shared condition puts them at a higher risk for the virus. In March, her husband withdrew from work and she began working at home. Smith has overseen a team of nurses in the oncology, hematology, and palliative-care units at the Oxford University Hospitals for ten years. Working from home was “like having your right arm chopped off,” she told me. Hearing about her staff’s distress from afar has been painful. “Not being there in such a crisis, you do feel you’ve let your team down,” she said. On Thursday, the 10th, Smith’s manager called and asked if she’d like the vaccine. She booked an appointment for Friday at 7 a.m. “It was really buzzy, and it was brilliantly organized,” she said. Foster, the nurse in Oxford, gave her the jab, and Smith chatted excitedly the whole way through. “I was, like, oh, a human being! A real person!” The shot was painless. “She was really gentle. I didn’t feel a thing,” Smith said. “It kind of just filled us with hope.” Some of her colleagues were nearby, and “everyone was excited,” Smith said. “We were like kids in a sweets shop.” When Gavin Bowden, a spinal surgeon who has been self-isolating at home for several months because of underlying medical conditions, arrived at the Churchill hospital for his appointment, he found the scene similarly electric. “People weren’t going to worry how long they were waiting,” he said. “People were really quite animated about it—there were people texting and people talking.” The news had just broken that two N.H.S. workers had developed an allergic reaction after taking the vaccine, and a nurse in line next to him said that she was worried. But Bowden had no such hesitations. “You just had a sense that actually here was the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. Foster was in the hub that day; she gave Bowden his shot. By the end of the week, Foster was vaccinating about fifty patients a day. She had recently received the vaccination herself. Like many other frontline workers with whom I spoke, who were constantly putting themselves in harm’s way to protect others, Foster seemed to feel a little guilty about her own vaccination. She was still worrying about everyone else. “The directive from the N.H.S. was that, literally, if there is a bare-armed member of N.H.S. staff that is available to take it, and you’ve got two or three left, they are not to be wasted,” she told me. “So, over the course of the week, we searched for our bare-armed colleagues, and anyone who passed had it.” One evening, toward the end of the week, she couldn’t find anyone else to inoculate. “At nine o’clock at night, we were the only bare-armed people still around,” she said. “So, I have had it.” A previous version of this post mischaracterized the kinds of surgeries delayed as a result of the pandemic.

America Is Running Out of Nurses,17757,"Just how big is the coronavirus’s winter wave? It can be hard to get your mind around it. One way to try is to note that, right now, more than a hundred thousand Americans are in the hospital with covid-19—which is roughly as many people as can fit into the country’s biggest stadiums for the Super Bowl, and nearly twice as many as were hospitalized during the pandemic’s worst days in April and July. Another is to note that, around the U.S., hospitals are running out of nurses and doctors. At least half of all states are now facing staff shortages, and more than a third of hospitals in states as varied as Arkansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Wisconsin are simply running out of staff. Ordinarily, an I.C.U. nurse might care for, at most, two critically ill patients at a time. Now, some are caring for as many as eight patients simultaneously. Recently, North Dakota’s governor issued an order allowing asymptomatic but coronavirus-positive health-care workers to continue seeing patients. (People without symptoms can still be infectious.) In most of California, I.C.U. usage now exceeds eighty-five per cent—the threshold above which new stay-at-home restrictions kick in. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the nation’s hospitals have developed protocols and purchased ventilators, and the mortality rate has fallen. But now the spread of the virus is so extreme that a shortfall of clinicians is becoming an insurmountable barrier in the fight against covid-19. Alexi Nazem is the co-founder and C.E.O. of Nomad Health, a medical-staffing company based in New York City. Nomad fills physician and nursing needs across the U.S.; it sends nurses, in particular, to hospitals big and small, urban and rural, from coast to coast. Nazem has marked the evolution of the pandemic by the scale of the job orders he’s received, which have shifted, more or less, with the seasons. “It’s been a remarkable roller coaster,” he told me recently. In the spring, it was a “five-alarm fire.” There were unprecedented needs in New York and other early epicenters, but hospitals around the country felt compelled to staff up, too. “No one had ever experienced anything like it,” he said. “Hospitals looked around and saw that the covid light switch could flip overnight. They thought the same thing would happen to them. There was an explosion of job orders from all over.” For the most part, though, covid-19 patients didn’t materialize; many hospitals, having postponed elective procedures and non-urgent visits, sat empty and ended up cancelling their staffing requests. “It was complete whiplash,” Nazem said. “They said, ‘Actually, we don’t need all these extra people. We can’t even afford to pay our regular staff.’ ” In the summer, when the coronavirus surged across the Sun Belt—in Florida, Texas, Arizona—Nazem’s company sent clinicians to affected states. But hospitals elsewhere didn’t feel the need to bolster covid-19 staffing. “Hospitals were more experienced by then,” Nazem said. “They weren’t over-ordering.” The composition of new job requests also shifted. Many hospitals were staffing not for coronavirus wards but to help in operating rooms and procedural suites that had postponed cases and were now running overtime to work through huge backlogs of colonoscopies and knee replacements. “These specialties were the worst hit in the spring,” Nazem said. “They were among the hottest in the summer.” Now the need for clinicians has erupted again. “It’s been insane,” Nazem said. “Orders are coming from everywhere. There are no hot spots. It’s crazier than we’ve ever seen.” In the past, Nomad Health has provided hospitals with nurses who will work specifically on covid-19. “It’s now impossible to distinguish by job,” Nazem said. “Hospitals are saying, ‘Just come. Who knows what we’ll need you for.’ ” Given the current wave’s persistence, hospitals are renewing contracts for travelling nurses at unprecedented rates, effectively taking them out of circulation. “The number of extension requests tripled from summer to fall,” Nazem said. “The market is getting tighter and tighter. Hospitals are saying, ‘Let me hold on to whatever I can.’ ” In the past, they were picky about whom they would hire. “They used to say, ‘We need the perfect person,’ ” Nazem told me. “Now they say, ‘If you find someone, anyone, send them over.’ ” (Nomad Health thoroughly reviews credentials for each clinician; Nazem was at pains to say that quality has not been compromised.) In normal times, there are some fifty thousand travelling nurses in the United States. Most are full-time gig workers who move from job to job, usually staying in one place for thirteen weeks. (That length is a holdover from old maternity-leave policies for nurses; the staffing industry evolved, in part, to fill such gaps.) According to Nazem, travelling nurses generally fit two profiles. One group consists of early-career nurses who want to acquire a range of clinical experiences—academic, urban, rural—and to travel the country. Another includes nurses at the end of their careers: “They say, ‘Hey, the kids are out of the house. I’d like to make some extra money. Wouldn’t it be fun to go to Alaska for the summer?’ ” The pandemic has diversified the pool. Severe staff shortages have brought more nurses into the travelling workforce. Many clinicians, especially those with critical-care training, feel an obligation to help. But, because demand has far outpaced supply, pay for travelling nurses has also skyrocketed. “Traditional nurses look around and say, ‘Hey, that travelling nurse is making double what I am,’ ” Nazem said. Before the pandemic, hospitals might have offered a travelling nurse seventy-five dollars an hour; now, in many places, that rate has tripled. “High pay draws more supply into the market,” Nazem said. “But at some point you reach a limit. Even if you were willing to pay a thousand dollars an hour, there just aren’t enough nurses. All you’re doing then is shuffling people around. You’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. We’re dangerously close to that.” Gary Solesbee has an understated manner and an easy Texas drawl; he has been a nurse for twenty-seven years. Last year, he and his wife, who is also a nurse, decided to travel. It would be a chance to explore the country and to spend time with their adult children, who were scattered in different states. In December, they started an assignment in Webster, Texas. In March, they left for Walla Walla, Washington, where their son lives, and where, shortly after they arrived, coronavirus patients began to trickle in. Over the summer, when cases exploded in the Southwest, they signed on with an academic hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “When we started travel-nursing, we had no idea we’d be doing covid nursing,” Solesbee told me. “But that’s pretty much what it’s become.” Solesbee, who now works in a step-down unit—the rung between a regular medical floor and the I.C.U.—is one of several hundred travelling nurses his current hospital system, in Albuquerque, has hired to contend with the surge. Solesbee’s hospital, like many around the country, has had to refashion many floors into covid-19 units. “It’s weird to go to an orthopedics floor and see it transformed for covid care,” Solesbee said. “Then you go to gynecology, it’s half covid. Outpatient services, all covid. Everywhere—it’s covid, covid, covid.” Last month, the New Mexico health department opened another hospital nearby to house recovering coronavirus patients who had no place to go. I asked Solesbee if he saw any signs of cases abating. “It feels like it’s picking up, actually,” he said. “We’re bracing for a surge on top of a surge during the holidays.” In recent weeks, he has been asked to pick up additional shifts as the need for nursing care has grown further. Each shift lasts twelve hours, sometimes more. “You get very fatigued,” he said. “Patients are incredibly sick. You’re on your feet all day, going in and out of rooms, putting on, taking off P.P.E. When I get home, I take my scrubs off and collapse. It’s like nothing I’ve experienced before.” Still, he agreed to the extra shifts, mostly out of a sense of duty. He’s decided to stay on through the winter. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist “It’s disheartening that much of the public still isn’t taking this seriously,” Solesbee said. “I want to tell them, ‘Come to work with me one day. See what it’s like.’ ” Caring for coronavirus patients is exhausting, but it’s their intense isolation, not clinical complexity, that bothers Solesbee most. “That’s the worst thing,” he said. “They can’t have family or visitors come in. We’re the only contact they have, and we can’t be with them as much as usual. We’re supposed to bundle care, limit exposure, do what you need to do and get out.” Still, there are moments when compassion trumps protocol. Recently, an elderly patient’s blood-oxygen levels dipped to dangerous levels despite maximum support. After declining a ventilator, he prepared to die. A nurse sat in the room with the patient, calling each of his family members on FaceTime, one by one, so they could said their goodbyes. “Sometimes, it’s the only thing we can do for people,” Solesbee told me. “But, in some ways, it’s the most important thing.” The other night, Solesbee sat with a dying man who had no family. With no one to call, he simply held the man’s hand as the patient’s breathing grew ragged and intermittent. Finally, it stopped. Solesbee stood up. Another patient needed his help. Terri Newland is a critical-care nurse from Greenville, North Carolina, but has been on the road for much of the past two years: Mesa, Arizona; the Chesapeake Bay; Charlottesville, Virginia. In January, she started work at a twenty-five-bed critical-access hospital in Berlin, Wisconsin, a town of some six thousand people about twenty-five miles from Lake Winnebago. In the spring, as the coronavirus started to spread, the hospital delayed elective procedures and sent staff to larger hospitals to gain extra critical-care training. Soon, patients started presenting with cough, fever, and trouble breathing. At that time, Newland’s hospital sent its coronavirus swabs to an external lab; it took up to three days for the results to return. “In the meantime, we wore full protective gear with anyone who might have covid while we waited for their test to come back,” Newland said. “It was very disorienting for older patients. They can’t see your face. They can’t hear what you’re saying. They needed human contact, and we couldn’t give that to them.” Newland recalled a patient in her seventies whose room overlooked the parking lot. Each evening, the woman’s family would gather outside the window, call her phone, and mime through the glass. One evening, Newland walked in during the ritual. She helped the woman take a selfie with her family. “I still cherish that photo,” she said. She intended to leave when her contract ended in May, but by then the pandemic had deepened such that she felt uncomfortable travelling. “I was stuck,” she said. “It didn’t feel right getting on a plane and flying home.” So she stayed. In August, Newland took a job in an I.C.U. in Greensboro, North Carolina, about two hours from home. The local health system has tried to restrict covid-19 care to a single hospital to prevent the coronavirus from spreading because of medical care. Newland works mostly in a “clean” hospital but is sometimes asked to help in the covid-19 hospital, which is staffed primarily by travelling nurses. The sense of camaraderie there is palpable. “The pandemic has really pulled us together,” she said. “Everyone is doing what they have to do. We try to help each other because we know what it’s like when things get crazy.” Newland, who works night shifts, also makes it a point to serve as a conduit for patients’ families. “I want them to know that just because they can’t come in doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten them,” she said. “I give them my number and say, ‘If you wake up at 3 a.m. and want to know what’s going on, call me. I will talk you through this.’ ” Some staffing companies offer housing, or make referrals to agencies that help travellers secure accommodations. Newland prefers to do her own thing. She’s currently staying in a trailer at a campground near her hospital; in Wisconsin, she rented space in a basement, which she found through a travelling-nurse Facebook group. Many nurses she knows stay in hotels, but, “personally, I need more of a home feel,” she told me. “I can’t imagine staying in a hotel for months on end. Work can be hard; it’s nice to have some space to relax and enjoy the days off.” She likes the travel, but worries about what will happen as more nurses choose to hit the road. Desperate hospitals are offering high-paying contracts to lure nurses into the travelling workforce. “I think a lot of nurses will end up paying for it with their mental and physical well-being,” Newland said. There is also, of course, the unavoidable distribution problem. “I’m seeing lots of core staff leaving for travel gigs. And I wonder, are we filling some holes by opening up others?” As a clinician, there is perhaps nothing more demoralizing than the sense that you’re providing substandard care. That feeling, however vague, nags at the core of your professionalism, until it ruptures into what the writer Diane Silver has called “moral injury”—“a deep soul wound that pierces a person’s identity, sense of morality, and relationship to society.” The term was originally coined to describe trauma suffered by soldiers at war, but it’s since been adapted for the struggles of health-care workers contending with a system that often hinders their ability to do what’s right for patients. It’s an outcome that becomes unavoidable when, as now, the flood of patients far outstrips the capacity of people to care for them. Despite the best efforts of the most dedicated clinicians, medical care grows disorganized. You start to miss things. Often the overlooked things are insignificant—a delayed dose of stool softener, for example—but sometimes they’re lethal: an undiagnosed blood clot, or a patient who, on his way to the bathroom, removes his oxygen mask, collapses, and is found dead forty-five minutes later. In the spring, disparities in covid-19 deaths arising from inadequate staffing levels were among the ugliest aspects of the pandemic’s first wave. At some overwhelmed hospitals during New York’s surge, the patient-to-nurse ratio quadrupled in I.C.U.s; on the coronavirus floors, some nurses cared for as many as twenty patients at a time. The covid-19 death rate at poorly resourced hospitals was two, even three, times that of well-resourced ones, owing partly to gross inequities in staffing. This is to say nothing of the suffering not captured by statistics: patients isolated, lonely, disoriented; families going without updates on their loved ones; health-care workers who reach the brink of burnout, then cross over. We’re now approaching, and in some places passing, the threshold at which patients, families, and clinicians suffer the preventable consequences of a health-care system beyond its limits. There’s always been a need for staffing companies like Nomad Health, but the pandemic has pushed them into a more central role. The government has been able to mobilize some medical personnel, but the vast majority of emergency pandemic staffing has been organized by companies like Nomad. “It’s like we’ve been training for the Olympics, and they’re finally here,” Nazem said. “We’ve been doing all this in the background for years. We were practicing archery when no one was watching. Now it’s the Olympics, and all of a sudden archery is really important.” Before the pandemic, few staffing agencies saw themselves as so directly in the business of saving lives. Now the crisis has elevated their work. “It feels different now,” Nazem said. “We’re asking so much of our staff—long hours, complex work. But I think they truly feel that when they work hard, it makes a difference in people’s lives. We’re getting clinicians to the bedside, and, as a result, patients are getting the care they need.” For now. There will come a point—likely soon—when supply won’t meet the demand. The infection curve will overwhelm the most efficient planning, the most creative C.E.O.s, and the most committed clinicians. Murky as it may be, there is, in fact, an upper bound, defined by the ruthless logic of biology and math. “If and when we hit the limit depends entirely on our national public-health response,” Nazem said. “But people should know: there is a hard limit. Every day that something doesn’t change, we get closer to it.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"American Tragedy and Comedy, Streaming on YouTube",8934,"Our species cannot make sense of warnings. In January, when reports of the coronavirus in Wuhan began to appear on the front page of the Times, we in New York grimaced and flipped past. Even as northern Italy succumbed, Milan’s Fashion Week rattled along. Something was happening to someone else, again. In retrospect, the confused feeling of early March in New York was like the sickening pause that heralds the arrival of a tsunami, the water receding before the wave crashes down. Now that we have been spat out onto drier land, we try to persuade the rest of the country to look at us, to listen, to learn from our mistakes, and we get silence, or worse, in return. If the progression of the unchecked virus doesn’t scare the anti-maskers and the politicians who cynically enable them, it’s unlikely that watching “The Line,” a new play by Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen about New York City health-care workers battling covid-19, will do much to advance the cause. Still, it makes for an urgent, heartrending hour; maybe dramatized truth can slip through a window when the doors of reason have been slammed. Directed by Blank, and produced and presented by the Public, “The Line” is streaming on YouTube through September 1st, and, in a welcome effort at accessibility, is also available with Spanish subtitles, in closed captioning and sign language, and with audio description for the visually impaired. So far, more than twenty-eight thousand people have watched the play, likely a far larger audience than the physical theatre could have accommodated over the course of a run. If there is an understandable appetite for escapism these days, there is clearly also a hunger for works that try to parse our baffling shared reality. Blank and Jensen practice a documentary style of play-making, which involves interviewing the real people they depict, who are generally caught in the teeth of tragedy. Their previous work includes “The Exonerated,” about inmates freed from death row, and “Coal Country,” which opened at the Public in early March and focusses on members of a West Virginia mining community that’s reeling from a deadly explosion. The characters in “The Line” include Oscar (John Ortiz), a gregarious E.M.T. from Queens; Ed (Jamey Sheridan), a gruff, streetwise paramedic; and Sharon (Lorraine Toussaint), a nurse who is fiercely protective of the geriatric patients she cares for. David (Santino Fontana), a Long Islander, became a nurse after training as an actor; Dwight (Nicholas Pinnock), an immigrant from Trinidad, came to the profession after finding that he had no head for business. Vikram (Arjun Gupta), an emergency-room doctor who treats some of the city’s poorest patients, is coolly analytical—he catches the virus early and reports to work the moment he has recovered—while Jennifer (Alison Pill), an outspoken first-year intern in Brooklyn, seethes with fury at her hospital’s failure to adequately prepare for covid, and its attempts to cover up its negligence. Each actor narrates his or her character’s story, looking into the camera of a computer or a phone, as if chatting from home with an interviewer; the clips are intercut so that a collective narrative arc traces the arrival and the spread of the virus. What emerges is a communal experience of horror, told with stark specificity: the non-stop emergency calls, the intubations, the lack of P.P.E., the stunned families, and, everywhere, the fear, the death, the grief. Sharon, who nearly died from the virus herself, says, “Then I come back to work and find out that half my population is gone.” The performers are, to a person, subtle, vivid, and direct; their voices amplify one another, and, as they do, a bigger picture of the city clicks into focus. These people know their town better than anyone; they have seen that who you are, and where and how you live, can make all the difference when it comes to survival. “We caught one aspect of it on a video,” Vikram says, referring to America’s lethal racism and the killing of George Floyd. “But with medicine there is no video.” FEATURED VIDEO Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle Perform Songs from Their Upcoming Albums Early in the crisis, workers like these were branded, by the Mayor, and in the popular imagination, as health-care “heroes.” One of the messages to be taken from these testimonials is the obfuscating inadequacy of such titles. “Now we’re heroes? What the fuck do you think we were doing before all of this?” David says—and he’s the sweet one of the bunch. “ ‘Hero’ is a word we use in the face of fear, and it separates us from each other,” Ed says. “Same thing after 9/11.” Ed’s preferred term is a “chain” or a “line,” which includes the postal workers and the grocery clerks, the cleaners, the security guards, the food deliverers, and everyone else who, at great personal risk, has kept the city afloat. We lucky ones owe them our health. Guaranteeing theirs is the only way to repay the debt. Catching stuff on video is at the heart of the comedian Hannibal Buress’s terrific new special, “Miami Nights.” Buress recorded the show in front of a live audience last summer, and released it for free on YouTube in early July. Buress, who may still be best known as the guy whose joke about the rape accusations against Bill Cosby turned the popular tide, is “medium famous,” a status that he discusses without rancor. Comedy nerds know him from “The Eric Andre Show,” on Adult Swim; millennials know him as Ilana Glazer’s boyfriend on “Broad City.” Twice a year, he says, he’s asked to host a game show. (“the prophecy will be fulfilled, but the time is not now,” he booms in a mike-enhanced God voice, as cheesy apocalyptic flames engulf the screen that forms the back wall of the stage. “i will continue on my path toward the country playing mid- to large-size venues and occasionally popping up in big-budget white comedy.”) He looks great, with a charming bit of belly, in a snug gray T-shirt that makes him seem younger, at thirty-seven, than he used to when he wore button-downs and blazers onstage. A lot of comedy specials sag onscreen without the energy from an audience to boost the room, but Buress’s is perfect for home viewing. Tightly directed by Kristian Mercado, the show is highly visual, with the vast screen providing effects and illustration for Buress’s bits. It’s one of the better onstage representations I’ve seen of Internet brain, the way we think in links and gifs and memes. “I hate the fact that you can just Google how much somebody’s house costs,” he says. “And I hate the fact that I don’t have the self-control to not do that while I’m in somebody’s house.” Buress has always had a goofy streak, and some of his silliest riffs are pure candy. There’s a bit on the rapper 2 Chainz begging God for various custom automobiles, and Buress has fun messing around with the mike, spinning out a scenario in which a throat-cancer survivor with an Auto-Tuned voice box delivers a hauntingly mellifluous anti-smoking P.S.A. to schoolkids. But mortality is also on his mind. He talks about quitting drinking, about his asthma, and about death. “I want my own way of dying,” he says. It’s a joke about ego, but the unspoken subtext—about the precise way in which a Black man in America does not want to die—hangs in the air, to be picked up in the story that the act has been building toward, which takes up the last twenty minutes of the hour-long show. In 2018, Buress made the news after he was arrested for disorderly conduct during a boozy night in Miami. What distinguished the episode was his ingenious decision (if, given his state of mind, it can be called that) to speak directly into the cop’s body camera. He plays us the footage. There he is, as amiable as ever, stooping to get his angle: “Hey, what’s up, it’s me, Hannibal Buress. This cop’s stupid as fuck.” Without hitting the notes too hard, Buress takes us through the rest of his Miami night, ending with a twist that lands, especially now, as sublime catharsis. The encounter could have ended tragically. Instead, Buress turned it into comedy. A knife’s edge separates one from the other, and it’s getting thinner all the time. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Death of Hahnemann Hospital,38406,"Lia Logio arrived at Hahnemann University Hospital, in Philadelphia, in March, 2018, two months after it was sold to a private-equity firm. Logio, an internist, had come from Weill Cornell, in New York, a prestigious and well-funded nonprofit hospital, where she was a vice-chair. Hahnemann served mostly low-income patients, but it had a range of medical subspecialties and was the primary teaching hospital used by Drexel University’s College of Medicine. “It felt like they had all the ingredients to do something innovative and creative,” Logio said not long ago. “It seemed like an opportunity to have an economy of scale to do coördinated care for poor, complex patients, which usually doesn’t happen very well.” Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in the United States, with about a quarter of its 1.6 million residents living below the poverty line. Since 1977, when Philadelphia General closed, it has also been the largest American city without a public hospital. Hahnemann, with nearly five hundred beds, occupied a city block on the edge of North Philadelphia, an area that includes several impoverished neighborhoods. A majority of the more than fifty thousand patients that the hospital treated each year had publicly funded medical insurance or none at all; two-thirds were Black or Hispanic. Because Hahnemann treated so many poor patients, it had significant financial difficulties. But patient outcomes rivalled those of practically any hospital in the country, and the people who worked there were driven by a sense of mission. “The doctors at Hahnemann were there because they wanted to be there,” Logio said. “Hahnemann took care of the people that no one else wanted to take care of.” Logio regarded for-profit medicine with deep skepticism, but her new colleagues made her hopeful. “Everyone had this tremendous sense of positivity looking toward the future with the new owners,” she said. Hahnemann and another medical center, St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, had been acquired, for a hundred and seventy million dollars, by American Academic Health System, a company controlled by the California private-equity firm Paladin Healthcare Capital. Joel Freedman, the founder and C.E.O. of Paladin, had managed a sizable hospital in Washington, D.C., and a few smaller ones in Los Angeles. He seemed earnest about his commitment to Hahnemann, buying a large town house in Philadelphia and moving there with his wife and children. Freedman told Logio and other senior staff that he was considering creating a new center for outpatient care. He talked about opening a pediatric clinic to serve poor families. His staff met with members of each department, asking what equipment they needed. In early 2018, Hahnemann received a deep cleaning, which included scrubbing the grout with toothbrushes. For the previous two decades, the hospital had been owned by Tenet Healthcare, a multinational company that had neglected to maintain the facility. Now, to many staffers, it seemed that, finally, someone was listening to them. Broad and imposing, Freedman projected the reassuring self-confidence of a serial entrepreneur. He had arranged funding from two institutional investors: MidCap Financial—an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, one of the largest private-equity firms in the country—and Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, another private-equity firm, with some thirteen billion dollars under management. Bloomberg Businessweek has called Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, “the most feared man in the most aggressive realm of finance.” In May, 2018, the hospital held a banquet at the Logan Hotel, near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Some two hundred doctors went to hear the new owner speak. Joseph Boselli, a sixty-one-year-old internist who had been at Hahnemann for more than thirty years, and who was now the president of the medical staff, introduced Freedman. “This was the first time that many people had seen him in person,” Boselli recalled. “I told him, ‘Joel, keep it short and sweet.’ ” But Freedman talked for about thirty minutes. Evidently displeased with the financial condition of his new acquisition, he sought to blame the physicians who made up his audience. “He goes on and on about how he doesn’t think doctors are doing their job,” Boselli said. “That they’re not training residents well, not seeing enough patients.” Still, the medical staff hoped that Freedman would provide the funding Hahnemann needed to survive. David Stein, who was then the chair of surgery at Hahnemann, said, “I don’t think anyone saw the writing on the wall—that by the following summer they’d be closing the institution.” Hospitals in the U.S. are estimated to be closing at a rate of about thirty a year. Most closures happen for financial reasons, in places where there are relatively few privately insured patients. Increasingly, hospitals are regarded as businesses like any other: at least a fifth of hospitals are now run for profit, and, globally, private-equity investment in health care has tripled since 2015; last year, some sixty-six billion dollars was spent on acquisitions. The industry’s movement into health care has been linked to price hikes, an increase in unnecessary procedures, and the destabilization of health-care networks. The bad actors of private equity are sometimes accused of destroying American health care. But they are more symptoms than disease. The story of Hahnemann is as much about the structural forces that have compromised many American hospitals—stingy public investment, weak regulation, and a blind belief in the wisdom of the market—as it is about the motives of private-equity firms. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures The idea that hospitals should turn a profit is somewhat recent. Pennsylvania Hospital, which is widely considered the oldest in the country, opened in Philadelphia in 1752. Co-founded by Benjamin Franklin, it was conceived as a place for “the reception and cure of the sick poor,” an example that, until the late nineteenth century, almost all American hospitals followed. Philanthropy—and taxes, in the case of public hospitals, like Bellevue, in New York, which opened in 1795—covered costs, and care was provided free. The model evoked Hippocrates, who believed that, when possible, doctors should forgo fees. But it also reflected the crudity of the era’s health care. Before Pasteur’s germ theory was published, in 1861, hospitals were often unsanitary, as likely to cause infection as to cure it. Doctors relied heavily on a few primitive treatments: leeches, lancets, laxatives, liquor. Anyone with the resources to do so avoided hospitals altogether. As the medical historian David Oshinsky writes, in “Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America’s Most Storied Hospital,” “There was nothing a hospital could do for the upper and middle classes that couldn’t be done better at home.” The institution that would become Hahnemann University Hospital, named for the German homeopath Samuel Hahnemann, was founded in 1848, amid advances in medicine that radically improved the quality of care: the stethoscope, blood transfusion, effective anesthetics. As hospitals offered novel procedures, they began to attract paying patients. To accommodate them, hospitals built separate units, with fireplaces and private rooms. In 1957, a Hahnemann cardiac surgeon named Charles Bailey appeared on the cover of Time, after he’d completed a groundbreaking surgery to correct an abnormality of the mitral valve. Bailey, who attracted patients from around the world, was one of a number of Hahnemann physicians working at the medical vanguard of specialty procedures. In 1958, a Hahnemann administrator noted that Bailey and his team brought in some eight hundred thousand dollars a year. In the decades after the Second World War, the cost of hospital care rose significantly, spurred by expensive procedures like Bailey’s and by the adoption of medical insurance. After the government began to offer tax breaks for employers who paid for their workers’ health benefits, the number of insured Americans grew to more than sixty per cent of the population. In 1965, the bill establishing Medicare and Medicaid passed, further increasing the number of patients seeking care. Guidelines dictated reimbursement for “reasonable costs,” which, for years, amounted to pretty much whatever providers said they were, and for-profit hospitals sprang up to capitalize on the boom. By the end of the decade, more than seven hundred for-profit insurance companies were offering medical coverage. For-profit hospitals arrived in Pennsylvania in 1998. Tenet Healthcare, based in Dallas, owned a hundred and twenty hospitals in eighteen states, and that November the company bought Hahnemann out of bankruptcy, along with St. Christopher’s and six other area hospitals. “We promise we will be here for the long haul,” Michael Focht, Tenet’s C.O.O., said at a ceremony held at Hahnemann. “This is not a short-term visit.” Eight years later, Tenet agreed to pay nearly nine hundred million dollars in fines to the Justice Department for excessive Medicare billing, distributing kickbacks to doctors, and exaggerating the severity of diagnoses in order to inflate charges. Mike Halter, who served as C.E.O. of Hahnemann under Tenet for two decades, told me that Tenet was forced to cut costs, which it did in part by ignoring requests to replace old equipment. Health care “is a very capital-intensive business,” he said. “Equipment has a useful life of five or six years. Facilities need to be upgraded every eight or ten.” A piece of stucco broke loose from the building and damaged a car. In reviews online, patients lamented conditions in the hospital. In December, 2013, a pregnant woman who went for an ultrasound complained of being kept in a cold room with flickering lights. In 2017, a patient reported finding “blood and shit on the floor.” Yet the hospital remained busy. “A lot of patients just didn’t have a choice,” Kevin D’Mello, an internist, said. “This is where they had to go.” Freedman founded his first investment company with several young investment bankers about thirty years ago, when he was in his twenties. “We had a mentor who taught us how to turn around distressed businesses and acquire companies,” he told me. “For the better part of seventeen years, that was my core business, restructuring insolvent companies.” By the end of 2011, Freedman and some partners had taken over four struggling hospitals in L.A., where a majority of the patients were Black or Hispanic, uninsured or covered by Medicare or Medicaid, and often afflicted with chronic illnesses. Many of those patients used the emergency room as their primary source of care, and Freedman’s group focussed on making the E.R. more efficient: hiring doctors with expertise in medical coding, in order to maximize reimbursement; pursuing insurers for unpaid invoices; reducing the time patients spent in the E.R. Soon, all four hospitals were solvent. In 2014, with Paladin, Freedman signed on to manage Howard University Hospital, in Washington, D.C., which that year reported a fifty-eight-million-dollar loss. Paladin cut salaries, benefits, and operating expenses, and two years later the hospital showed an operating surplus of more than twenty million dollars. “We were incredibly successful,” Freedman said. “I’d become passionate about turnarounds in these communities.” Hahnemann staffers said that Freedman seemed to see reviving struggling hospitals as a reflection of his benevolence. He communicated a mixture of good intentions, sanctimony, and unabashed self-regard. He assured one physician that he and his wife, Stella, were people of deep religious faith. At other times, he boasted about his real estate. In addition to the Philadelphia town house, he owned a home in Hermosa Beach, with views of the Pacific. He was a member of an advisory council at Harvard Medical School, and sat on the board of a health-policy center at the University of Southern California. In 2016, Freedman had received a lifetime-achievement award from a prominent nonprofit for his contributions to reducing racial health-care disparities. “He wanted to look like the hero,” a former senior Hahnemann doctor told me. Freedman seemed convinced that he was uniquely well suited to sort out Hahnemann’s problems, but there were differences between Hahnemann and the other hospitals he’d helped lead. “He talked a lot about the things that made him successful at Howard,” Jill Tillman, a health-care executive at Drexel College of Medicine, told me. But, unlike Howard, Hahnemann had long been under for-profit management. Tenet, as one of the world’s largest buyers of hospital equipment, enjoys deep discounts and generally excels at controlling costs. “If Tenet couldn’t get any more juice out of it, there was no more juice left to get,” Tillman said. Freedman also said that he had a plan to address the financial challenges of treating publicly insured patients. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for more than sixty per cent of all U.S. hospital care, often pay less than the cost of treatment: according to an analysis by the American Hospital Association, in 2018 Medicare and Medicaid underpaid the cost of care by a combined $76.6 billion. In an early meeting with Halter, the Hahnemann C.E.O., Freedman explained that, at his other hospitals, he had profited from federal Disproportionate Share Hospital programs, which reward hospitals that serve large numbers of publicly insured patients. “What Joel did not know is that there are caps on Disproportionate Share payments in the state of Pennsylvania,” Halter said. He explained to Freedman that Hahnemann was already at its cap. “He told me, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about,’ ” Halter said. Only after meeting with the governor’s office and the state Department of Human Services did Freedman accept that Hahnemann would not receive additional payment from these programs. In April, 2018, Halter retired. In the next eighteen months, Hahnemann and St. Christopher’s went through half a dozen chief-executive and financial officers, most of them dismissed by Freedman with little explanation. Freedman hired battalions of consultants, who specialized in health care, technology, and management. “I would walk down the hall and half or two-thirds of the people I would not recognize,” George Amrom, a former surgeon and long-serving chief medical officer, recalled. “They were all consultants.” Few of them lasted long. “Joel has a twenty-week relationship with people,” a former Hahnemann executive said. “The first eight, you’re a ‘rock star.’ In the middle, you don’t hear from him. The last eight weeks, it’s ‘You’re a nice guy, but I need a rock star.’ ” Senior physicians and administrators found it hard to plan for the future. Stein, the surgery chair, had been told that his department would be prioritized. He drew up detailed plans for improvement, some of which required no capital investment, and sent copies to each successive Hahnemann C.E.O. But none of them were in place long enough to act. Logio had a similar experience. “I had the same conversation with every single C.E.O.,” she said. “And as soon as the C.E.O. got fired I would have to start over.” A majority of the hospital’s patients came through the E.R., and Freedman believed that improving the flow of patients, and more precisely documenting the severity of their conditions for insurers, would allow Hahnemann to vastly increase revenue. One day, medical staff arrived at the E.R. to find that the procedures for patient check-in and ordering tests had been altered. Edward Ramoska, who had been a Hahnemann E.R. doctor since 2006, said, “It could potentially have worked for a community hospital”—one with no medical residency. But Hahnemann was a teaching hospital, with one of the largest residencies in the nation. Forty-five residents worked in the E.R. alone. Before an attending physician saw a patient, a resident generally took a medical history and conducted a physical exam. In the new E.R., patients were shuttled between a holding area and examination rooms, often undressing more than once. In addition to exasperating doctors and patients, the arrangement slowed the department’s operations. “They didn’t understand how an academic emergency room works,” Ramoska said, of American Academic Health System. A physical renovation of the E.R., intended to make things more efficient, was botched. A new door frame was too narrow for wheelchairs. Walls went up on either side of a service window. A space intended for patient examinations was built without a sink, forcing doctors to run elsewhere to wash their hands. In Pennsylvania, alterations to health-care facilities require approval from the Department of Health, which the hospital’s management had neglected to get. Construction stopped and did not resume. To increase reimbursements, A.A.H.S. hired a team of nurse-consultants to monitor how doctors documented diagnoses. Virtually all U.S. hospitals try to maximize payments from insurance companies, but the new approach struck some Hahnemann doctors as intrusive, if not unethical. The nurse-consultants sometimes second-guessed the diagnoses of residents. “They were thinking about the bottom line, and we were just thinking about the patient,” Christy Johnson, a former resident, said. Since 2008, American hospitals have been involved in more than a thousand mergers and acquisitions, resulting in large, powerful health systems with influence on the price of hospital care and the reimbursement rates paid by private insurers. These conglomerates generally make up the losses incurred treating poor patients by building referral networks that attract privately insured patients seeking specialized care. In Philadelphia, Tenet drew few referrals. As the Jefferson and Penn health systems cultivated satellite hospitals, physician practices, and urgent-care centers, including those in wealthy suburbs on the Main Line and in South Jersey, Tenet closed or sold most of its local holdings. Some of Hahnemann’s best-known specialists left for other hospitals. After a group of cardiologists departed, the hospital’s heart-transplant program closed. If there was an area where Freedman’s ostensible skill set met Hahnemann’s needs, it was the negotiation of partnerships to draw referrals. “He went out and met with various leaders at different facilities,” the former Hahnemann executive recalled. “At one point, there was going to be a relationship with organization X. Next, it would be organization Y. There were always a lot of deals in flux, none of which came to fruition.” Freedman did not appear to grasp the economics of tertiary care, the specialty practices that generate costly procedures. “He did not understand that if you do away with tertiary care no one’s going to come downtown to Hahnemann,” Amrom, the former chief medical officer, said. “I remember trying to explain to him that one of our largest areas was nephrology. And if you did away with transplant you’re going to destroy nephrology.” Many insurance companies paid less at Hahnemann than they did at other area hospitals, an arrangement that, according to Halter, Tenet had accepted in exchange for greater reimbursements in the company’s other markets. (Tenet denies having made this arrangement.) Now those agreements could be renegotiated. The insurance companies had an incentive to compromise: if Hahnemann closed, the privately insured patients treated there would go to other city hospitals, where the cost of their care would rise. “You go into Blue Cross and you say, ‘We need some help, and it’s in your best interest to help us,’ ” Halter explained. “ ‘Give us ten million dollars more per year’—versus losing fifty million per year.” Whether Freedman overlooked this tactic or simply struggled to execute it effectively is unclear. “I did initiate a recontracting effort,” he said. “But it was to their advantage to delay.” In late 2018, Freedman told staff that, by the spring of the following year, the hospital might be profitable. His forecast was based in part on the assumption that increasing in-patient admissions through the E.R. would yield greater reimbursements from insurance companies. But insurers continued to deny many Hahnemann claims, leaving Freedman incredulous. At one point, Tillman, the health-care executive, recalled him telling her, “This is impossible. You’re lying to me!” Hoping to convince one major private insurer that it had unjustly denied claims from Hahnemann, several doctors arranged a meeting with the company. “We found a few very good cases of patients who could have died if they didn’t get care,” Kevin D’Mello, the internist, who attended the meeting, said. “And the insurance company had rejected admission.” D’Mello said that the insurance representatives initially seemed receptive. Then, uninvited, Freedman appeared and harangued the representatives, accusing their company of dishonesty. “He said that American Academic would resubmit all claims for the past year, and that they expected the insurance company to pay,” D’Mello recalled. The meeting ended without a compromise on the insurance-claims dispute. (Freedman does not recall the meeting.) Such erratic behavior was becoming increasingly common. “He would call people stupid,” Tillman said. “He would say they should all be fired, that they were useless.” (Freedman told me that he does not remember using such language, but, he said, “I can express myself with passion.”) In one meeting, a Drexel administrator said, Freedman spoke for ten hours, pausing only for cigarette breaks. He threatened at one moment to close the hospital and the next he fantasized about instituting valet parking. Maria Scenna, a former C.E.O. of St. Christopher’s, told me, “He would speak as the authority on everything.” Still, Freedman’s anxiety was rising—at least in part because of his obligations to his lenders. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banks that once financed most leveraged buyouts have withdrawn, and private-equity firms have filled the void. According to an analysis by the Financial Times, some of the largest private-equity companies in the U.S.—including Blackstone, Apollo, and K.K.R.—now do at least as much lending as buying. Riskier deals can involve terms that one prominent New York lawyer, who represents private-equity lenders, described to me as thuggish: “knuckle-dragger” conditions. “If you’re coming to me, that means you can’t get a loan from a bank,” the lawyer explained. “So I can charge you outrageous interest.” MidCap Financial, the Apollo affiliate, provided Freedman’s group, A.A.H.S., with two loans, representing a commitment of a hundred and twenty million dollars. The loans had nine- to ten-and-a-half-per-cent-effective interest rates—significantly steeper than most commercial bank loans—and were secured by mortgages on Hahnemann’s real estate. (Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, which provided fifty-one million dollars in loans, took part ownership of several hospital-adjacent properties.) These financial obligations, in combination with what Freedman describes as “bad debt,” raised the possibility that he would have to default, and that Hahnemann would go out of business. Around March, 2019, Scenna said, administrators and executives suggested that Freedman consider filing for bankruptcy. Instead, he proposed gutting the residency program—an indispensable source of physician labor, whose cost was largely borne by federal funding. Eventually convinced that this was inadvisable, Freedman announced the departure of Suzanne Richards, the latest C.E.O. of Hahnemann and St. Christopher’s, and, in early April, the hospital laid off a hundred and seventy-five employees, including sixty-five nurses. Freedman said, “I felt immense pressure every hour of the day—not only from a financial perspective but, more importantly, because of my concern for quality of care.” A.A.H.S. began closing floors of the hospital, but the execution was fitful. All or part of a floor might close one week and reopen the next, resulting in the frequent movement of patients. “Your patients could end up anywhere,” Steven Kutalek, a cardiologist, said. One day, with little input from medical staff, the patients in the cardiac critical-care unit began to be moved to the main I.C.U. Cardiology specialists now had to shuttle between the twelfth and the twenty-first floors to see their patients, using elevators that were often broken. “Cardiac patients need specialized equipment—balloon pumps, crash beds, ecmo [a blood-oxygenation machine]—run by cardiac nurses,” Kutalek said. These items were hard to access in the main I.C.U., and it didn’t help that many cardiac nurses had been either fired or reassigned. Paulina Gorodin-Kiliddar, another cardiologist, told me, “I remember one instance where the telemetry monitor for one patient who had a critical event malfunctioned, and it went unnoticed for a while.” Any savings proved insufficient. In early May, A.A.H.S. received a notice of default from MidCap Financial. In the next seven weeks, Freedman and his executives met with city and state officials to try to find a way to keep Hahnemann afloat. Freedman hoped that the government would provide emergency funding, or that Drexel would buy the hospital. But, according to government officials, they never received the details about the hospital’s finances that they needed to determine how to address its operating deficit, which Freedman estimated at between three million and five million dollars per month. On June 30th, Hahnemann, St. Christopher’s, and several related entities filed for bankruptcy. A longtime Hahnemann physician says that Freedman told her, “My wife turned the faucet off. She said, ‘No more. We’re not losing any more money, Joel.’ ” (Freedman does not recall saying this.) One afternoon in July, hundreds of people gathered outside Hahnemann, on North Broad Street. The road was closed to traffic for several blocks, and, in the southbound lanes, white folding chairs had been arranged in rows to face a lectern bearing a blue Bernie Sanders placard. A recently released patient, a Black man with facial scars, held a bag containing medication and personal effects. Doctors in scrubs and white coats looked on from the sidewalk. Sanders had come to speak against Hahnemann’s closure. “If an investment banker like Joel Freedman is able to shut down Hahnemann and make a huge profit by turning this hospital into luxury condos,” he said, “it will send a signal to every vulture fund on Wall Street that they can do the same thing, in community after community after community.” Sanders was expressing what had become a widely accepted theory. From the beginning, the thinking went, Freedman’s purchase of Hahnemann had been a ploy to acquire the land on which it stood. Situated steps from city hall and the convention center, the real estate had skyrocketed in value. The mile-and-a-half stretch of North Broad between Hahnemann and Temple University, in North Philly, had long been run-down. But now developers were building luxury condos and rentals. To renovate the Metropolitan Opera House, a moldering wreck at North Broad and Poplar, Live Nation spent fifty-six million dollars, then filled the schedule with such acts as Alicia Keys and Sting. “Everyone and their mother was trying to get that real estate,” Peter Kelsen, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Blank Rome, told me, speaking of Hahnemann. “I received calls from dozens of different people.” Developers speculated that it could be worth as much as a hundred and twenty million dollars—only fifty million less than A.A.H.S. had paid for Hahnemann and St. Christopher’s and all their assets. Crucially, the site was not part of the bankruptcy. Upon buying Hahnemann, Freedman had put its real estate in a suite of holding companies that were now beyond the purview of the bankruptcy court. The maneuver was typical of private-equity deals, in which firms can borrow against the assets of the companies they’re buying. Eileen Appelbaum, a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, has written extensively about the influence of private equity. She told me that Hahnemann’s demise reminded her of the retail sector, where hedge funds and private equity have used leveraged buyouts to purchase chains like Sears and Toys R Us, and then stripped their assets, including real estate, en route to bankruptcies. Appelbaum worries that Hahnemann might become a model, encouraging investors to destroy hospitals that occupy valuable land. “It definitely looks as if it was meant to be a real-estate deal,” she said. The structure of the Hahnemann deal insulated Freedman from much of the potential fallout. As the hospital floundered, staffers said, Freedman told them that, if they couldn’t make the hospital succeed, he would simply turn the property into something else. Freedman denies making such remarks, and, as a strategy for acquiring real estate, deliberately bankrupting a hospital of Hahnemann’s size was likely too messy to be practical. “It’s not the path that anyone would have chosen,” Andrew Eisenstein, the founder of the Philadelphia development and investment firm Iron Stone Real Estate Partners, said. (Iron Stone later acquired two parcels of real estate from companies controlled by Freedman and Harrison Street.) Freedman told me that he would never have invested millions in the venture if he intended to turn a quick profit and leave. But his leveraged buyout made excellent insurance against his own mistakes. By May, 2019, when staff at Hahnemann tried to order basic supplies venders had begun to turn them down, saying that the hospital hadn’t paid its bills; by summer, conditions were dire. Surgical equipment was broken. The air-conditioning failed. To stretch supplies, nurses cut up the washcloths that they used on patients. Parts for instruments used to intubate patients and deliver intravenous medicine became scarce. It was difficult to find a pacemaker. Medications ran out. Even the FedEx account was cut off. “It happened so quickly and so horribly,” Lorraine Alexander, a senior nurse, told me. “It was heartbreaking to see, and it was also just mind-boggling—the things that were allowed to happen.” Bruce Meyer, the president of Jefferson Health, told me that Thomas Jefferson University Hospital began hearing from Hahnemann physicians that the hospital could no longer provide quality care. “We began parking ambulances outside [Hahnemann] in mid to late June, and shuttling back and forth,” Meyer said. Leaders from Jefferson and other Philadelphia hospitals asked for information about Hahnemann’s patient population, to prepare for their arrival. “We never got any of that data,” Meyer said. Pennsylvania law requires a hospital to provide ninety days’ notice and a detailed closure plan in advance of ceasing operations. But, even before a closure plan was approved by city and state officials, A.A.H.S. frantically tried to empty Hahnemann. At night, private ambulances lined up at the rear of the building, waiting to take patients away—part of what staffers viewed as a reckless effort to discharge Hahnemann’s occupants. “You’d have a census of two hundred and seventy-five at midnight, and the next day at noon it would have dropped to two hundred,” Alexander said. Patients were released without clear plans for follow-up care, and often ended up back in the E.R. within twelve hours. Shanna Hobson, an E.R. nurse, said that a patient who had been prematurely taken off I.V. antibiotics returned with sepsis. Others came back with infected diabetic wounds. Around that time, Sean Temple, who had been treated at Hahnemann for a heart condition for a decade, went for a routine cardiology appointment. His doctors had just been informed that their practice would be shut down. “They were under the gun,” Temple said. He felt blindsided. “It’s not like I came in and I knew that y’all were shutting down. Who’s gonna pick up where they left off? And when and where?” Months passed without Temple’s seeing a doctor, and he ended up at another hospital with a cardiac emergency. “I felt like a child lost in the park,” he said. Freedman places responsibility for the execution of Hahnemann’s closure on EisnerAmper, an accounting-and-consulting firm that he hired to manage its finances and, later, the bankruptcy. (EisnerAmper declined to comment.) A report by a bankruptcy-court-appointed ombudsman describes two visits to Hahnemann in July, 2019, when the hospital’s census had already fallen significantly, and after a temporary manager had been assigned by the state. “None of the nursing staff indicated any concerns over diminished care or safety of the patients,” the report reads. In advance of Hahnemann’s shutdown, on September 6th, city and state officials pledged up to fifteen million dollars to take care of the hospital’s patients. When other hospitals in Philadelphia had closed, a spike in infant mortality quickly followed. To prevent this, Jefferson brought on eight Hahnemann ob-gyns and expanded its obstetric unit. Hospitals across the city hired more staff and adjusted workflow patterns. Temple and Pennsylvania Hospitals soon saw their E.R. volume increase by about twelve per cent, while at Jefferson, which is only a mile from Hahnemann, volume climbed by twenty per cent, adding almost twelve hundred visits a month. At all three E.R.s, the number of ambulance visits at least doubled. Unable to walk, drive, or take public transportation, patients who arrive in ambulances tend to be sicker and poorer than those who come by other means. Ambulances typically take patients to the nearest hospital. But the E.R.s were now frequently so crowded that the staff requested that patients go elsewhere. Studies of Black cardiac patients have shown ambulance diversion to be responsible for elevated numbers of deaths. Kory London, an emergency-medicine physician at Jefferson Health, told me that the E.R. became the scene of “daily human tragedies.” Most Philadelphia hospitals use an electronic record-sharing system, but Hahnemann had never taken part in it. Once the hospital closed, doctors at other medical centers had difficulty obtaining records for Hahnemann patients. “There were patients who had complex social histories, who were receiving many kinds of subspecialty care,” London said. “They’d lost heart doctors, kidney doctors, and ended up in our emergency department. We had to understand as best we could what was going on with them.” Anastasia Cavanaugh, who has a chronic illness, had been seeing doctors at Hahnemann for years. “Knowing who your doctor is, that is one control you have,” she told me. When the offices of several of her specialists closed abruptly, Cavanaugh, who had publicly funded insurance, despaired. “I cried for three days,” she said. By January, 2020, Cavanaugh hadn’t been able to see a doctor since Hahnemann closed. She feared that she’d have to visit an emergency room in flu season—a frightening prospect for the immunocompromised—in order to refill her prescriptions. “I was calling UPenn,” she recalled. “The ‘emergency appointment’ was a month and a half away. It was a very stressful time. I didn’t know if I could get my medications on time.” In Philadelphia, as elsewhere across the country, people of color have borne the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, 2020, city officials entered negotiations with Freedman to reopen Hahnemann to house covid patients during an anticipated surge. But Freedman asked for more than four hundred thousand dollars a month to lease the facility—a rate that he said was “very reasonable.” The talks quickly broke down. Responsibility for the care of coronavirus patients fell heavily on the remaining hospitals in the area, including Temple, which converted a seven-story pavilion to a coronavirus clinic, and erected a tent outside the E.R. There have been some hundred and fifty thousand confirmed infections in the city, and more than thirty-six hundred deaths. “What I feel about this whole event is that it’s moral injury at a corporate level,” Lia Logio, the internist, said. “Health care is supposed to be about taking care of the patients. Helping people to have long, flourishing lives, with limited illness and limited pain. Somehow, it isn’t a priority.” When I spoke to Freedman by phone last summer, he had returned to California, where he had bought a new eight-thousand-square-foot house south of Los Angeles, with twenty-foot ceilings and a stone spa, for nearly seven million dollars. He was in the midst of two lawsuits with Tenet Healthcare, which he believes misled him about Hahnemann’s financial situation. Freedman estimates that he has personally lost at least ten million dollars on the Hahnemann deal. He was asked to step down from his board position at the University of Southern California. “That really hurt me,” he said. But St. Christopher’s Hospital had been sold, for fifty million dollars, and MidCap Financial had been repaid in full. Now Freedman was trying to reinvent himself. As we spoke one afternoon, there was an audible breeze on Freedman’s end of the line. The family’s Maltese, Snow, barked in the background. Freedman’s confidence was undimmed. “I’m working on some things that I think could be meaningful,” he said. “I would like to go back to working in health care someday. I have a lot of knowledge. I’ve seen a lot of bad things. Unfortunately, the solutions demand a lot of capital.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Republican War on Voting,8515,"In 2017, when Donald Trump filed for reëlection hours after his Inauguration, he managed to accelerate the pace of stumping for the next election as soon as one was over. Four years later, the campaigning for 2022 has begun offstage, in statehouses around the country. Republican lawmakers, eager to thwart any future groundswell of voting by Democrats, especially people of color and young adults, have proposed—and in some cases already passed—at least two hundred and fifty-three bills that make it harder to cast a ballot in forty-three states. The gist of these bills can be summed up by one of their proponents, the Republican Arizona State Representative John Kavanagh, who believes that “everybody shouldn’t be voting.” The top contenders for the state with the most draconian anti-voting laws are Arizona, Kavanagh’s state, and Georgia, home to the voting-rights advocate Stacey Abrams and the two newest Democratic members of the U.S. Senate, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, whose victories are an object lesson in the value of concerted get-out-the-vote efforts. (Both states’ legislatures and governorships are controlled by the G.O.P.) Going strictly by the numbers, Arizona is winning: it has nineteen pending bills to Georgia’s eleven. They include making it a felony to send an absentee ballot to anyone who is not on the permanent absentee-ballot roster, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, and disallowing mailed ballots that are not notarized. (Republican legislators in New York, Indiana, and Mississippi are also proposing a proof-of-citizenship requirement.) Arizona is also the plaintiff in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, a case now being considered by the Supreme Court that could further erode the Voting Rights Act of 1965 not just in that state but across the country. In 2013, the Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder led to the imposition of restrictive voting laws in many states. As Dylan Matthews pointed out in Vox nearly three years ago, ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, that decision “caused the median voter in affected congressional districts to move to the right” which, in turn, “led to the election of more conservative members of Congress, who were less likely to sponsor civil rights bills.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? The current case stems from two provisions: the first came as a result of the Shelby decision, and invalidates votes cast at the wrong polling site; the second was passed by the Arizona legislature in 2016 and bans anyone other than a family member or a caretaker from collecting and delivering ballots. Prior to the 2016 election, the Democratic National Committee sued the Arizona attorney general, Mark Brnovich, contending that both provisions were unlawful under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That section allows challenges to voting laws that are either deliberately or inadvertently racially discriminatory. The polling-place provision, the D.N.C. argued, is inequitable because polling sites in nonwhite localities are moved more frequently, and, according to the Arizona A.C.L.U., people in those communities themselves change addresses more often, so it is not uncommon for people to show up to vote at the wrong place. The ballot-collection law, according to the D.N.C., is especially harmful to Native Americans who live on reservations that are far from polling locations or post offices and rely on community members to deliver their ballots. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on March 2nd, and is expected to issue a decision by July. If Arizona wins the contest of retrograde anti-voting bills by the numbers, Georgia wins it by overt malice. The Republican-controlled House there has passed a bill, H.B. 531, making it a misdemeanor to hand out water and food to people waiting in line to vote. This bill might be inconsequential in the tonier neighborhoods of Atlanta, where there are plenty of polling places and the wait to vote is minimal. But Georgia has a history of closing polling locations in low-income areas; as a result, standing in line to vote for five, six, or even ten hours has become a regular occurrence. There is no reason to make it a crime to aid people waiting in those lines other than to discourage them from standing there in the first place. Another provision of H.B. 531 all but eliminates Sunday voting, a provision aimed, with little subtlety, at keeping Black voters away from the polls, by curtailing the “souls to the polls” tradition in the Black community of voting after church. Add to these proposals the elimination of automatic voter registration—in which Georgia currently leads the nation, having added hundreds of thousands of new voters since it was instituted, in 2016—as well as the revocation of “no excuse” absentee voting (well more than a million Georgians, both Republicans and Democrats, voted absentee in the 2020 election) to name just a few of the new laws that the Republican legislative majority has been pushing. “We are seeing again and again this version of Jim Crow in a suit and tie,” Stacey Abrams told Ari Berman, in Mother Jones, “because it is designed explicitly for the same reason as Jim Crow did, to block communities of color from active participation in choosing the leadership that will guide their democracy.” The runners-up to Georgia and Arizona are numerous. Most are using Trump’s false and discredited claims of widespread voter fraud to justify their actions. Pennsylvania Republicans would like to insure that mailed ballots that are not received by 8 p.m. on Election Day—even if they are postmarked before that day—are not counted. They are also eager to outlaw ballot drop boxes. New Hampshire Republicans would like to prohibit college students from voting there by disallowing student I.D. cards to be used to verify residency status. (Students without a New Hampshire driver’s license would then find it nearly impossible to vote. College students comprise roughly twelve per cent of the state’s population.) Republican legislators in five states—Connecticut, Hawaii, Montana, New Hampshire, and Virginia—are seeking to eliminate same-day voter registration. In Iowa, Republican legislators aim to reduce both the period in which voters can request an absentee ballot and the number of early-voting days. (They already reduced it from forty days to twenty-nine, in 2017.) And, in Texas, a new bill would require disabled voters requesting absentee ballots to provide proof of their disability, eliminate drive-through voting, and reduce early-voting hours. The list goes on. The pattern here is so obvious that it is worth pointing out only because it cannot be repeated enough: Republican legislators are afraid of voters. This may be yet more evidence that, as my colleague Jelani Cobb has reported, the G.O.P.’s demographic contraction alone may put it out of business. (That demographic may be rendering itself more vulnerable; according to recent polling, an alarming forty-one per cent of Republicans say that they will not get a covid-19 vaccination.) But it is also evidence that using the mechanics of democracy to pass laws that disenfranchise voters is not only an effective way to hold on to power long past one’s sell-by date but also an expedient and seemingly legal way to overthrow democracy itself. For a party that is scared of voters, this is the point. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The F.D.A.’s Extraordinary Approval of a Questionable Treatment for Alzheimer’s,11259,"My father died of Alzheimer’s disease in 2010. Since April, my mother has lived in the memory-care unit of a nursing home in Connecticut. She is lucid at times, but more often she has trouble remembering whether I am her son, her husband, or her father. I have covered wars and riots and a long string of epidemics. None of them frightened me the way that Alzheimer’s does. I am far from alone. More than six million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, a number that is certain to grow as more people survive into their eighties and nineties. But tens of millions of their family members, colleagues, and friends also struggle every day with the reality of this wholly disabling disease. Last week, in what should have been truly exciting news, the Food and Drug Administration approved aducanumab, the first new drug in nearly twenty years that is designed to treat Alzheimer’s patients. But, in doing so, the agency ignored the overwhelmingly negative recommendation of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee, none of whose members found sufficient evidence that the drug could slow the cognitive decline that is a hallmark of dementia. Ten members voted against approval; one voted “uncertain.” Another member abstained because he had been an investigator on one of the drug’s two major trials. By the end of the week, three of the committee members had resigned, and many experts suggested that the new drug, which Biogen will market as Aduhelm, could cause more problems than it will solve, both for people with Alzheimer’s and for the nation’s health-care system. “This might be the worst approval decision that the F.D.A. has made that I can remember,” Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told the Times. He resigned from the committee on Thursday, after having served on it for six years. Another member who resigned, David S. Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, wrote to the F.D.A. that “the whole saga of the approval of aducanumab . . . made a mockery of the committee’s consultative process.” (The F.D.A. is not bound by any committee recommendation. Usually, when the agency disagrees with its advisory boards, it does so to reject a drug that has been endorsed. It is very rare for the agency to ignore such an overwhelmingly negative recommendation.) The decision will have implications that reach far beyond the introduction of a single drug designed to treat one disease. In the past, the F.D.A. approved several therapies aimed at relieving symptoms of Alzheimer’s; these medications attempt to regulate chemicals that ferry messages between nerve cells. But none of those drugs stop the damage to the brain. At best, they have proved moderately successful for a few months. Until now, there have been no drugs that treat an underlying cause of the disease. Aducanumab, which has been in clinical trials for years, attacks the amyloid-protein plaques that many researchers believe impair the cognitive function of the brain. Scientists regard those plaques as clear biological markers of Alzheimer’s, and they have tried for decades to demonstrate that reducing those amyloid levels could help patients to regain their cognitive abilities, or at least to halt their decline. None of the drugs in those past studies had any impact on the progress of the disease. The two clinical trials that led the F.D.A. to approve aducanumab achieved the same indirect goal: showing the drug’s ability to reduce plaques that accumulate in the brain. But the initial data on slowing patients’ cognitive decline was so poor that, in 2019, the company halted the studies. It was only after researchers from Biogen, in consultation with the F.D.A., reëxamined the data later in the year, and included more than three hundred additional participants who completed the studies after the initial data was evaluated, that they noticed something they regarded as promising. In one of the two studies, the drug seemed to slow cognitive decline in a number of early-stage patients who were treated with a high dose of the drug. The difference between the effect of aducanumab and the placebo was a fraction of a point, on an eighteen-point scale. The second study found that the drug offered no benefit. Nonetheless, instead of evaluating this medicine solely on whether it affects cognition, the F.D.A. granted conditional approval based on aducanumab’s ability to reduce those amyloid plaques. It’s not unusual for the F.D.A. to grant early access to drugs that seem to work on surrogate markers, like the plaques or blood levels, rather than on the direct improvement of a patient. The agency has granted what is generally known as accelerated approval to more than two hundred drugs since 1992. Most are for rare diseases, which affect few patients, or, as is the case with Alzheimer’s, those for which there is no other available treatment. The agency requires that pharmaceutical companies conduct additional clinical trials to prove that the treatment works. For a drug like aducanumab, such a study will take years—and it will remain on the market throughout that study. Since previous clinical trials that linked reducing plaques to improved brain function have uniformly failed, experts were seeking a more promising result. They did not find it. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Couple’s Last Words to Each Other Aducanumab will not be a simple medicine to take, and it will demand many resources. The drug needs to be administered intravenously for an hour; that will almost certainly require a visit to a clinic or doctor’s office. Patients will need regular M.R.I.s, in part to insure that they are not suffering adverse effects from the treatment. About forty per cent of participants in the two studies experienced (mostly mild) brain swelling or bleeding after taking the drug. And the company has said that a prescription will cost fifty-six thousand dollars a year. That figure has already caused outrage. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review carried out an analysis of the trial results and concluded, as have so many other experts, that “current evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that aducanumab benefits patients.” The organization denounced the pricing structure of what it said “now seems likely to become one of the top selling drugs in the history of the United States.” It is not yet clear which private insurers will pay for it. The vast majority of Alzheimer’s patients are elderly, and many are insured by Medicare. Even if the federal government could negotiate significantly lower prices, Medicare does not have the money to spend billions of dollars a year on one questionable therapy. Last Monday, Patrizia Cavazzoni, the director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, issued a statement attempting to explain the agency’s decision. “We ultimately decided to use the Accelerated Approval pathway—a pathway intended to provide earlier access to potentially valuable therapies for patients with serious diseases where there is an unmet need, and where there is an expectation of clinical benefit despite some residual uncertainty regarding that benefit,” she said. “In determining that the application met the requirements for Accelerated Approval, the Agency concluded that the benefits of Aduhelm for patients with Alzheimer’s disease outweighed the risks of the therapy.” Experts have struggled to find a scientific rationale. “I’m quite surprised,” Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist who served on the F.D.A.’s advisory panel and voted against the approval of aducanumab, told Stat News. “The most compelling argument for approval was the unmet need but that cannot, or should not, trump regulatory standards,” he said. “It’s hard to find any scientist who thinks the data are persuasive. Unmet need is an important contextual factor but it’s not an evidentiary threshold.” Moreover, the studies focussed on people in the early stages of the disease, but the F.D.A. has approved the drug for use by anyone with Alzheimer’s—even though it was not tested on people with more advanced cases. That almost assures that thousands of seriously ill Americans will take the drug without any scientific justification for doing so. Jason Karlawish, a co-director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Memory Center, in Philadelphia, who ran one of the trial sites, told Reuters, “This decision has shaken the foundations of the scientific process and methods.” He added, “It’s a disturbing set of events, scientifically, clinically, politically.” aids activists began to campaign for earlier access to experimental medicine in the late nineteen-eighties. They argued that people who were almost certain to die and had no alternatives should have the opportunity to take those drugs before trials had proved they were effective. That practice was considered acceptable at the height of the aids epidemic, when so many people resorted to dangerous remedies that caused real harm, even death. It was not until 1987, six years into the epidemic, that AZT, the first drug to treat aids directly, was approved. The approach soon became routine for many diseases. It has been a largely successful attempt to balance compassion with the need for useful data. Fast-tracking the release of experimental medicines makes sense when the alternative is death. And it makes sense for diseases that affect a small population. Recently, though, an increasing number of drugs have been approved by that process. Critics argue that those approvals are too often based on tangential indicators that do not lead to better health outcomes. It has only been a year since Donald Trump extolled from the White House podium the virtues of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative against covid-19. There was no acceptable data to suggest that it worked. For some people, the drug was actually dangerous. But the F.D.A., under pressure from the White House, issued an emergency-use authorization. Less than three months later, once the drug’s failure became too clear to ignore, the agency was forced to withdraw the authorization. This is not how the F.D.A. is supposed to work. Millions of Americans rely on the agency to sift through data and present scientifically valid results. It is there to protect us, not to tell us what we want to hear. Often, this means that agency officials are required to convey bad news rather than hope. Understandably, we all prefer hope, but erasing the distinction between a medicine that works and one that does not will never provide it. And if the F.D.A. doesn’t understand that, who will?

Britain’s Vaccine Program Brings Joy and Chauvinism,6931,"At 6:31 a.m. on Tuesday, Margaret Keenan, a ninety-year-old former jewelry-shop assistant from the West Midlands, became the first person to receive a clinically approved coronavirus vaccine. Keenan was given the first of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at Coventry’s University Hospital. She wore a gray cardigan with black dots and a blue T-shirt adorned with a penguin in a Santa hat. “Is that done?” Keenan asked, when the injection, in her upper left arm, was over. “All done,” May Parsons, a National Health Service matron, replied, as she put on a Band-Aid. Cameras flashed, and Keenan was wheeled down a corridor lined with applauding medical staff, while Parsons prepared for the next patient in line, a man from Warwickshire named William Shakespeare. Watching and giving his reaction for television, Britain’s Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, teared up. And so began a joyous few hours of coördinated vaccinations across the country. In Northern Ireland, the first person to get the jab was Joanna Sloan, a twenty-eight-year-old senior nurse who will manage a vaccination center in Belfast. In Wales, it was a forty-eight-year-old care-home worker, Craig Atkins, from Ebbw Vale. At around 9 a.m., the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was at Guy’s Hospital, by London Bridge, to watch Lyn Wheeler, an eighty-one-year-old from Bromley, receive her first dose of the vaccine. “It’s all for Britain,” Wheeler said. The rapid launch of Britain’s coronavirus-vaccine drive is a triumph for Johnson’s government. The night before it began, Hancock branded the occasion as V Day, embracing, as is customary in Brexit Britain, any opportunity to refer to the Second World War. In recent days, around eight hundred thousand doses of the Pfizer vaccine—enough to vaccinate four hundred thousand people—have arrived from the drug company’s factory in Puurs, Belgium, after it was approved for emergency use by Britain’s medical regulator, on December 2nd. By the end of the year, another five million doses are expected, which will be administered by some fifty hospitals and immunization centers around the United Kingdom, before the effort moves to sports stadiums and other large community venues, next year. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" It is an exciting stage in what has been, until now, an erratic and botched response to the pandemic, which has killed seventy-five thousand people in the U.K. During the past nine months, Johnson and his ministers have dallied with herd immunity, promised a “world class” test-and-trace system, which has yet to materialize, and talked airily about Operation Moonshot, an estimated hundred-billion-pound mass-screening program, which is currently being piloted but whose usefulness has been questioned, because of a predicted large number of erroneous results. The government has moved fast in some quarters and slowly in others, and has broken things. Last month, the Financial Times reported that, among the G-7 group of large economies, Britain’s covid strategy is on course to achieve an unusual trifecta: the worst economic hit, the second-highest level of state spending, and the second-highest death rate. Thankfully, the government also bet big on vaccines. In addition to forty million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, Britain has ordered a hundred million doses of AstraZeneca’s, which was developed at Oxford University and is easier to move and store, and a batch of the Moderna version, for good measure. In total, the U.K. has more than three hundred and fifty-five million doses of various vaccines on the way. Johnson’s administration claims that leaving the European Union has given the country an edge in the vaccine race. Last week, when Britain’s medicines regulator approved the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use, Hancock claimed that its officials had been able to work faster “because of Brexit.” That was not true in any formal sense. As June Raine, the head of the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority, explained, Britain is still bound by European law until its absolute departure from the bloc, on January 1st. Under E.U. rules, any member state can grant emergency approval for a drug. (Hungary is currently planning to experiment with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.) The reason that most European countries haven’t done so is that they are coördinating their vaccination drives. The European Medicines Agency has pencilled approval of the Pfizer vaccine for December 29th. But Brexit, like other nationalist projects, has never been overly concerned with facts. It is more of an attitude. Gavin Williamson, Britain’s Education Secretary, was asked whether Brexit had helped to catalyze the vaccination drive. “We’ve obviously got the best medical regulators,” he told the radio station LBC. “Much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn’t surprise me at all, because we’re a much better country than every single one of them, aren’t we?” It takes a certain mind-set to see the ravages of covid-19—and the hopeful cross-border collaborations of science—as an opportunity for national self-congratulation. But here we are. On Wednesday, Johnson plans to travel to Brussels to finally seal the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal with the E.U. The second, and much more consequential, phase of negotiations around Britain’s departure from the bloc has been interrupted and overshadowed by the pandemic. But that hasn’t changed the underlying fact that, even if there is a deal, the U.K. will emerge on the other side of its current catastrophe with a more distant economic and political relationship with its neighbors than at any time in the past fifty years. And, for a time, despite all evidence to the contrary, its leaders will continue to tell the population that this was the right thing to do; that, in a troubled, randomly colliding world, we are better off apart, outsiders with an edge, taking a moonshot, celebrating our V Days.

Have You Already Had a Breakthrough COVID Infection?,30608,"For most of the year, Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the northern tip of Cape Cod, has around three thousand residents. In summertime, however, it becomes a vacation destination and gay mecca. Thousands of visitors typically descend for festivals, concerts, parades, comedy shows, and parties organized around themed weeks. Almost all of this has been suspended during the pandemic; in June, Provincetown didn’t record a single coronavirus case. Then, in early July, thousands of gay men arrived for Circuit Party week. The crowds thrummed with a sense of post-pandemic exuberance. The weather was rainy, and people squeezed into indoor venues “to the point you could hardly move,” one reveller, from Ohio, told the Washington Post. Another, speaking with NPR, recalled that it would “get so incredibly hot in these clubs that you would just be wet with sweat, so you’d have to step outside for a moment just to get a breath of fresh air.” Not long afterward, dozens of attendees developed symptoms of covid-19. Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly identified four hundred and sixty-nine new cases among Massachusetts residents. Almost all of the infections were due to the highly contagious Delta variant, and nearly three-quarters occurred in vaccinated people. By mid-July, the test-positivity rate in Provincetown had soared to over fifteen per cent. Perhaps the most concerning finding about the outbreak was that, judging by their nasal swabs, vaccinated and unvaccinated people were harboring similar levels of the virus. To some, this discovery suggested that immunized individuals might spread Delta more readily than previously thought; it prompted the C.D.C. to recommend that all Americans, regardless of vaccination status, resume wearing masks in public, indoor spaces when in locales with “substantial” or “high” covid transmission. (According to the agency’s definition, those designations apply to more than ninety per cent of counties in the U.S.) Many people heard about these findings late last month, when they appeared on slide seventeen of an internal document from the C.D.C., which was widely published in newspapers. The deck contained a few other concerning messages—that some thirty-five thousand vaccinated people experience symptomatic coronavirus infections each week; that the proportion of vaccinated individuals hospitalized with covid-19 has increased; that the Delta variant likely inflicts more severe disease than its predecessors. A single phrase in the deck was quoted in headlines: “The war has changed.” Even before Americans learned of the Provincetown outbreak, nearly two-thirds said that they were worried about the rise of Delta. Vaccinated people were much more likely to express concern—a sign that fear of breakthrough infection was starting to puncture the promise of post-pandemic life. Since then, American optimism has cratered, with a forty-nine-point drop in the number of survey respondents who say that our situation is getting better. We’re now more pessimistic about covid-19 than at any point since January, when we were in the midst of the nation’s deadliest weeks. But to what degree has the war really changed? How much do we actually know about breakthrough infections and their possible dangers? Understanding the risks is not easy. The lockdown mind-set, despite its obvious drawbacks, was cognitively simple; life in the liminal state asks us to carry a heavier mental load. This is especially true because the term “breakthrough infection” is vague. A breakthrough infection could be an illness that knocks you flat, a tickle in your nose, or nothing. Regular reports of breakthroughs suggest that we should be scared. But what exactly should we be scared of? In one sense, defining a breakthrough infection is straightforward: you have one if you test positive two or more weeks after completing all recommended doses of a covid vaccine. But, in another sense, the meaning of the term is unclear. A highly sensitive P.C.R. test has detected some of the virus’s genetic code inside your nose. So what? “Your body doesn’t produce infinite amounts of antibodies,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization who studies the push and pull between hosts and pathogens, told me. “Your lymph nodes are not, like, the horn of plenty.” It’s possible to be exposed to more virus than the antibodies in your nose can handle. Still, Rasmussen said, “When you’ve been immunized and get an ‘infection’ ”—she raised her hands in scare quotes—“or, I should say, when you test positive by P.C.R.—that doesn’t mean there’s a robust viral infection raging in your body. Even if some cells do get infected, other parts of the immune system spring into action and stop it from spreading.” She went on, “Is that an infection? That’s a philosophical question. Technically, some cells got infected and the virus started to replicate. But the immune system prevented you from getting sick and shedding copious amounts of virus that can go on to infect someone else.” Rasmussen thinks that, when it comes to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases, the term “breakthrough infection” is somewhat misleading. “It doesn’t describe how vaccines work very well,” she said. In such cases, the vaccines have actually succeeded, and there’s no meaningful sense in which the virus has broken through. Instead of using the breakthrough metaphor, Rasmussen suggests imagining an encounter between two armies. “The immune system has multiple specialized units that can be deployed strategically and dynamically,” she said. “The virus has some tricks up its sleeve, but, compared to the human immune system, it doesn’t have as much at its disposal. It’s like ‘Lord of the Rings’ or ‘Troy’: one army usually kicks the other’s ass. If you’re vaccinated, your immune system is ready, it’s better equipped, and it usually kicks the virus’s ass.” But not always. In some cases, the virus gains a foothold, multiplies, and challenges even a primed immune system, inflicting real disease—a true breakthrough. Michel Nussenzweig, a molecular immunologist at Rockefeller University, told me that three main factors influence the course of events. First, there are your antibody levels; second, there’s your antibodies’ affinity for a particular variant; and, third, there’s the amount of virus to which you’ve been exposed. Whether a small viral incursion escalates into a major battle depends on how those factors combine. Antibody levels rise and fall: right after infection or vaccination, B cells in our blood produce huge numbers of them, but, as the months pass, antibody levels decline. The key question is how these declines affect the course of a coronavirus infection. Declines might make it easier for the virus to establish a foothold in your body, but not necessarily translate into a substantial weakening of your immunity. Nussenzweig pointed me to a recent study done in Australia. The researchers found that, when a vaccinated person’s antibody levels fall to around twenty per cent of the typical post-infection level, protection against symptomatic infection drops to fifty per cent. Protection against severe disease, however, doesn’t fall to fifty per cent until antibodies wane to just three per cent of post-infection levels. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Many factors could account for the persistence of immune protection despite declines in antibodies. Part of the story may have to do with memory B cells—immune cells that hang around, sometimes for decades, for the specific purpose of quickly restarting our antibody response when a familiar pathogen reappears. T cells, which also continue to circulate long after an infection, also play a role, by hunting for infected cells. These and other systems come online quickly upon reinfection: like a computer coming out of sleep mode, the immune system snaps to life. All this means that lower antibody levels aren’t as bad as they sound. A little protection goes a long way. Viruses and vaccines are all different. Immunity against any given virus may or may not wane; the timeline for sars-CoV-2 immunity is not yet clear. But, even when resistance stays robust, viruses can mutate. The data used by the Australian researchers predates the global spread of the Delta variant, which seems to have some “immune-evasive” properties. Research so far indicates that antibodies developed for the original strain of the coronavirus may be only half or a third as effective against Delta. And Delta is different in another way: compared with the original virus, it generates a thousand-fold-higher viral load. Infected people are shedding a lot more of it. If you’re on the receiving end of that shedding, this could affect your “viral dose”—the amount of virus you’re exposed to. “The probability of getting infected with any virus is related to the number of infectious units that are going into you,” Nussenzweig said. Antibody levels, antibody affinity, and viral dose—these three factors form the bedrock of the breakthrough-infection story. They can combine in various ways. Our behavior affects the doses to which we’re exposed. We don’t know how much immunity is waning, and we are still learning about Delta’s properties. In the worst case, all three factors are at work. As Nussenzweig told me, “If, instead of getting x particles of the Wuhan strain, you get a thousand times x of Delta, and your antibody response is two or three times diminished because the vaccine was based on a prior version of the virus, and it’s been a number of months since you got your shot—well, that’s a problem.” But what exactly is the problem? Most vaccinated people no longer need to fear dying of a coronavirus infection. They are also much less likely to have to go to the hospital. But they do want to avoid getting seriously sick with an illness that, even if not life-threatening, could be profoundly unpleasant; they worry about giving the virus to others who are vulnerable; and they fear developing long covid—a syndrome of fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive problems, and loss of taste or smell—after even a mild breakthrough infection. Studies, unhelpfully, have placed the risk of developing long covid at somewhere between one and eighty-seven per cent. There are no precise estimates of how many Americans have it, and such estimates, if they existed, would vary depending on how the syndrome is defined. Still, if even a small fraction of the tens of millions of infected Americans develop a post-covid syndrome, their ranks could number in the tens of thousands. To estimate any of these risks, we need to know how many breakthroughs there are. But that number is hard to fix, for both conceptual and practical reasons. In May, the C.D.C. stopped tracking infections among vaccinated people that didn’t cause hospitalization or death, a decision it described as intended to “help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.” The move was widely criticized by patient advocacy groups, lawmakers, and public-health experts. But, in truth, studying all breakthrough infections presents serious data-collection challenges. The C.D.C. relies on passive and voluntary reporting of infections, but many cases, especially those that are mild or asymptomatic, are never reported. Meanwhile, when the agency tried to study people with asymptomatic breakthrough infections, it often found that there was “inadequate virus to even do so,” Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said. As an alternative to trying to track every breakthrough infection, researchers can use so-called cohort studies, which follow a defined group of people over time. This approach has an obvious advantage, in that you can test everyone—even those without symptoms. But it also has a critical limitation: you can never be quite certain how applicable the study’s findings are to other people, in other settings, at other times. A new cohort study from Israel—conducted during the reign of Alpha, not Delta—provides perhaps the most rigorous evidence on the frequency and severity of breakthrough infections. Researchers examined what happened after Sheba Medical Center, Israel’s largest hospital, vaccinated more than eleven thousand health-care workers between December, 2020, and April, 2021. During that period, around fifteen hundred workers experienced either a known coronavirus exposure or developed suspicious symptoms; of that number, thirty-nine—less than three per cent—tested positive for the coronavirus. Those who got infected tended to have lower antibody levels. Most had mild symptoms; a third were asymptomatic; no one had to be hospitalized; and no one passed the virus on to others. At the same time, nineteen per cent of those who experienced a breakthrough infection—seven people—continued to have symptoms, such as cough, fatigue, or loss of smell, six weeks later. These findings were widely publicized, sometimes in ways that focussed on this final, alarming statistic. “Study: 20% of vaccinated health workers who test positive suffer from long covid,” one headline read. “One in five breakthrough cases among health care workers in Israel resulted in long covid,” announced another. Such headlines, of course, fail to take account of the whole picture. In statistical terms, they neglect the “base rates” of infection. Take nineteen per cent of three per cent, and you’ll find that the people tested in the study had about a one-in-two-hundred chance of developing long covid. Even this number is too high: of the more than eleven thousand vaccinated people in the hospital, the researchers tested only those who had symptoms or a known coronavirus exposure. Widen the lens to take in all the vaccinated employees, and the long-covid rate drops to less than one tenth of one per cent—something like one in fifteen hundred people. Moreover, the study focussed on health-care workers, who have a higher than usual risk of contracting the virus and falling ill. In the pre-vaccine era, some studies estimated that they were nearly twenty times as likely to get infected, and more than seven times as likely to develop severe covid. The nineteen-per-cent figure itself may be higher than it should be. Farzad Mostashari, a former epidemic intelligence service officer at the C.D.C., has argued that a form of recall bias—a phenomenon in which people may attribute current symptoms to salient but unrelated prior events—could inflate the apparent prevalence of long covid. Suppose that you provide someone who’s been sick with a questionnaire, asking him to indicate which of a list of symptoms he has continued to suffer over the past few months. Faced with such a list, Mostashari wrote, on Twitter, “respondents often feel like they’re supposed to say ‘yes’ ” to some of the symptoms. In his view, this approach, which was taken in the Israeli study, could have led people to highlight symptoms needlessly. A better strategy would be to randomly select a group of people with no documented history of the coronavirus, ask them about any symptoms they’re experiencing, and only then check their blood for antibodies to see if they’ve previously been infected. A recent study from Germany, not yet peer-reviewed, took such an approach; it found that adolescents who reported long-covid-like symptoms were no more likely to have coronavirus antibodies than those who didn’t. Millions of Americans have been infected but never tested, and so conducting such a study in the U.S. would be feasible, theoretically. Until it’s done, the public conversation about breakthroughs and long covid will be driven by data that’s outdated or incomplete. The same is true for breakthroughs generally. As it stands, we don’t know, with nearly enough specificity, how frequently they occur—or who’s most at risk, under what circumstances, and with what implications. With so little conclusive data to go on, our reactions to what we learn about breakthroughs are heavily shaped by our expectations. When I first encountered the Provincetown findings, I felt discouraged. I hadn’t expected nearly three-quarters of the infections to register in fully vaccinated people—it was an outcome that seemed to strike at the heart of vaccine efficacy. But, with time, I’ve come to think that there are reasons that the Provincetown outbreak, like the Israeli study, might not be as bad as its most alarming statistic. Three-quarters sounds like a lot. But we need to revise our statistical expectations for a post-vaccine world. Consider some basic math: if no one is vaccinated, then there can be no breakthrough infections; if we’re all vaccinated, then every infection will be a breakthrough. Our understanding of the Provincetown outbreak, therefore, depends in part on the area’s vaccination rate. According to official tallies, nearly seventy per cent of the eligible people in Massachusetts were vaccinated prior to the outbreak. Assuming that’s true, there was virtually no difference in the chances of infection by vaccination status. But, according to the Provincetown town manager, the vaccination rate among town citizens may have been as high as ninety-five per cent. A twenty-five-per-cent shift in the vaccination rate dramatically alters the import of the Provincetown numbers. If only five per cent of people were unvaccinated, and they accounted for a quarter of infections, then an unvaccinated person was actually seven times more likely to get infected—and this in a town that was full of packed clubs, sweaty dance floors, maskless parties, and crowded restaurants. “This was a level of exposure that few vaccines could overcome,” Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. Given the role that viral dose plays in infections, it’s hard to imagine an environment more conducive to transmission. From this perspective, the size of the outbreak might actually be reassuring. Of course, we don’t know how likely out-of-town partiers were to have been vaccinated. We also don’t know how many people were infected in the outbreak but not identified, or whether they were vaccinated. “We don’t have denominators,” Nuzzo said. “We don’t know how many people were actually exposed.” By some estimates, there were as many as sixty thousand people in Provincetown during the first week of July. If this is the case, Nuzzo said, it could make breakthrough infections “really anomalous events.” Even the finding that vaccinated and unvaccinated people carry similar viral loads may not be as alarming as it sounds. Some have taken it to mean that the two groups are equally likely to pass the virus to others. But, once infected, vaccinated people tend to have fewer symptoms, reducing the chances that they’ll transmit the virus. Their antibodies may also move faster to coat it in ways that hamper its infectiousness and ability to replicate. One study, from Singapore, found that, while vaccinated and unvaccinated people have similar viral loads at first, the amount of circulating virus declines much faster in those who’ve been immunized. Perhaps the most important fact about the Provincetown outbreak is that the vaccines worked marvellously when it came to the most concerning consequences of infection. In recent weeks, the number of cases linked to the outbreak has climbed to more than a thousand. Still, there have been just seven hospitalizations and no deaths. As German Lopez has pointed out, at Vox, a similar cluster of cases before the vaccines might have led to around ninety hospitalizations and nine deaths. (The C.D.C. estimates that, across the nation, vaccinated people remain twenty-five times less likely to be hospitalized or die of covid-19.) “From that perspective,” Nuzzo told me, “we might say, ‘Wow, these vaccines actually worked really well.’ ” Our greatest fear is that, in the face of variants or time, vaccine efficacy might decline. Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, and yet it’s experiencing another covid surge. As with Provincetown, the headline numbers are concerning: some sixty per cent of Israelis currently hospitalized with covid-19 have been fully vaccinated. “I believe we are at war,” Salman Zarka, Israel’s coronavirus czar, told a parliamentary committee last week. If the vaccines are effective against Delta, how can this be? Here, too, it’s important to proceed slowly. One plausible answer is that, earlier this summer, as the pandemic’s toll lessened, Israel relaxed almost all social-distancing measures; even in a highly protected society, more contact almost always means more infection. But another answer has to do with how we analyze the numbers. Israel has an extremely high rate of vaccination: nearly eighty per cent of the over-twelve population is immunized. If we take the underlying immunization rate into account, the vaccines appear to be nearly seventy per cent effective at preventing hospitalization. And Jeffrey Morris, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the vaccines are probably even more effective. Morris points out that older people are more likely to be vaccinated: in Israel, ninety per cent of people older than fifty have gotten a vaccine, compared with seventy-three per cent under fifty. They are also, because of their age, more likely to suffer severe illness. The most vaccinated group also has the highest risk. These two factors combine—a disparity on top of a disparity—to create the impression of lowered efficacy. When we correct for these imbalances, Morris writes, the vaccines turn out to be eighty-five per cent effective at preventing severe disease in people over fifty, and more than ninety per cent effective for younger people. They still work. Denominators, definitions, Delta: these are the challenges we face in understanding breakthrough risk. Without knowing how many vaccinated people have actually been exposed to the virus, it’s hard to calculate the true risk of breakthrough infection. Meanwhile, the significance of each positive test in a vaccinated person is not clear: as Nuzzo put it, “We may just be catching people’s bodies going through the motions of containing the virus, exactly how vaccines trained the body to do.” And the Delta variant has rendered once sharp data foggy. A single worker in the Israeli hospital study couldn’t go back to work after six weeks; that puts the odds of serious breakthrough long covid somewhere close to the odds of getting struck by lightning. And yet the Israeli study was done before Delta. The Provincetown outbreak suggests that the likelihood of breakthrough illness with Delta could be meaningfully higher than in the past. How much higher? It’s hard to draw conclusions from just one, atypical instance. It’s possible that we’ll never have a satisfactory understanding of breakthrough infections. We may eventually arrive at a closer approximation of the breakthrough risk posed by Delta—but, by then, we could be contending with new variants, old vaccines, or waning immunity. Each time we try to map the risk landscape, the sand will move beneath our feet. What does this mean for the pandemic’s future? Nuzzo told me that, in her view, that’s an impossible question to answer without a clearer idea of what we’re trying to accomplish. “The stated public-health goals have shifted so many times,” she told me. “Laypeople are saying, ‘Wait, I thought we were worried about hospitals being overwhelmed?’ Then it was, ‘Oh, we need to close schools because we’re worried about children giving the virus to their grandparents.’ Now grandparents are vaccinated, but we still need masks? We still need distance? The vaccines aren’t good enough?” Speaking about public-health officials, Nuzzo said that “they haven’t yet defined for the public what their current rationale and exit ramps are. If you lead people to believe the vaccines are not sufficiently protective, then they’ll wonder, ‘When does this end?’ ” For the pandemic to resoundingly conclude, two trends must intersect. The virus must cease to inflict overwhelming harm, and the risks that remain must be judged low enough for society to proceed with normal life. On the first front, most vaccinated Americans should feel safe. But, on the second, we need data and we need a plan. “The public deserves a coherent strategy with end goals that define what we’re working toward, and then a research agenda aimed at answering the questions we need in order to make decisions,” Nuzzo told me. “That’s how we put ourselves in a position to decide when the pandemic is over.” To navigate uncertainty, we need nuanced thinking. Right now, we speak of breakthrough infections as binary events: the virus either breached the gates, or it didn’t. But the course of an infection and the circumstances around it are more important than the mere fact of a positive test. Are our immune systems still fighting off typical, predictable viral incursions? Or are small invasions more frequently escalating into pitched battles? The former suggests that we’re mostly safe most of the time; the latter is reason to pause business as usual. An all-or-nothing conceptualization of breakthroughs—one that overlooks the context and implications of P.C.R. positivity—coarsens the pandemic discourse and clouds our view of the future. It’s possible to see reports of breakthrough infections not as disheartening setbacks but as expected developments in the pandemic story. We’ve been talking about boosters since the first covid vaccines became available; all along, the implicit rationale—one that’s often gone unsaid—was that either our immunity would wane, or the virus’s genetic code would change, such that we would end up somewhat less protected. We’re now witnessing something like what we predicted. We’ve already read the script, but we’re still surprised by the plot twist. At the same time, it’s worth acknowledging to ourselves that, in the absence of definitive data, we are guessing about how we think the story will go. The Biden Administration is now recommending booster shots for most Americans, some as soon as September—about eight months after the first nursing-home residents and health-care workers were immunized. Its recommendation is based, in part, on three new studies, released by the C.D.C., which fail to present a slam-dunk case. One study, of thousands of nursing-home residents across the country, found that, in recent months, the vaccines’ effectiveness against infection had declined from about seventy-five to fifty-three per cent; it’s not entirely clear what to make of the findings, however, because we don’t know when the residents were vaccinated or whether they went on to have symptoms. A second study, focussed on New York State during the period that Delta came to dominate, found that the vaccines were still nearly eighty per cent effective at preventing infection—down from about ninety-two per cent—and that there was no change in how reliably they prevented hospitalization. The third study, which analyzed data from eighteen states, supported the latter finding: six months after being vaccinated, people were just as protected against a covid hospitalization as they were just after they got their shots. Over all, the evidence that vaccines prevent severe covid-19—even with Delta, even half a year after immunization—remains both clear and encouraging. By contrast, the data that breakthrough infections present a major concern for the average American is much murkier. In his “Pensées,” Blaise Pascal, the seventeenth-century French philosopher and mathematician, advanced an argument: Every rational person should believe in God. Pascal’s wager, as it’s come to be known, begins with the indisputable supposition that either God exists, or he doesn’t. If you believe in God, and he doesn’t exist, then you’ve lost very little—perhaps a chance at some risqué behavior that’s better avoided anyway. But if you don’t believe in God, and he does exist, you’re damned. Better to believe in God. We might not call this “belief,” exactly—it’s too calculated for that—but it does have a certain logical appeal. When it comes to breakthrough infections, we are not compelled to believe that they are seriously risky. The data are too inconclusive for that. But we may still choose, rationally, to make a wager. For vaccinated people, the coronavirus threat is massively, undeniably smaller than it was last year; at the same time, we are taking more risks—visiting family, attending weddings, going to church, returning to the office. We have to make decisions about what’s worth it, what isn’t, what we should do now, and what can wait. Like many Americans, I have started to scale back. I’ve cancelled trips, avoided gatherings, stopped dining indoors. In my work as a physician, I’m again wearing an N95 respirator with every patient, not just those who’ve tested positive for the virus. I’ve concluded that the risk of Delta causing a significant breakthrough illness for me—a reasonably healthy man in his thirties—is low, but also that it’s a better bet to assume that the risk is real. As a society, we are also making bets. We are now planning third shots for healthy Americans, even as billions of people around the world have yet to receive a single dose; in all likelihood, there will be college students in the U.S. who get boosters before nursing-home residents in Africa receive their first shots. Meanwhile, we don’t know, with any certainty, the true risks of waning immunity, of breakthrough infections, of long covid, or of Delta-inflicted breakthrough disease. Still, we are deciding that the costs of waiting to find out may exceed the costs of acting today. There are differences—morally, practically, emotionally—between being forced to feel afraid and choosing to be cautious.

The Delta Variant Is a Grave Danger to the Unvaccinated,14608,"Lineage B.1.617.2, now known as the Delta variant, was first detected in India, in December, 2020. An evolved version of sars-CoV-2, Delta has at least a dozen mutations, including several on its spike protein that make it vastly more contagious and possibly more lethal and vaccine-resistant than other strains. In India, the Delta variant contributed to the most devastating coronavirus wave the world has seen so far; now it has been detected in dozens of countries, including the United States. In the U.S., it accounts for a minority of cases—but it is rapidly outcompeting other variants, and will likely soon become our dominant lineage. Much of what we know about Delta is preliminary, and based on reports from India and, more recently, the U.K., where it now accounts for more than ninety per cent of new cases. Four-fifths of British adults have received at least one shot of a covid-19 vaccine, and more than half are fully vaccinated—but the variant has spread widely enough among those who remain vulnerable to fuel a quadrupling of cases and a doubling of hospitalizations in the past month. The vast majority of Delta-variant cases seem to have occurred in adults under fifty, whose rates of vaccination remain lower than those of older people. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the U.K.’s full reopening, originally scheduled for June 21st, would be postponed. Earlier this year, scientists estimated that lineage B.1.1.7—the Alpha variant, first isolated in England—could be some sixty per cent more transmissible than the original version of sars-CoV-2. Now experts believe that the Delta variant is sixty per cent more transmissible than Alpha—making it far more contagious than the virus that tore through the world in 2020. It hasn’t yet been conclusively shown that Delta is more lethal, but early evidence from the U.K. suggests that, compared to Alpha, it doubles the risk of a person’s being hospitalized. Even if the variant turns out to be no deadlier within any one person, its greater transmissibility means that it can inflict far more damage across a population, depending on how many people remain unvaccinated when it strikes. In this regard, India’s apocalyptic surge is Exhibit A. In May, at the crest of the wave, the role of the Delta variant was still unclear. A number of factors—the return of large gatherings, a decline in mask-wearing, and a sluggish vaccination campaign—had made a disaster of some kind more or less unavoidable. But it now seems likely that the rise of Delta accelerated the crisis into a shockingly rapid and widespread viral catastrophe. In the course of weeks, millions of people were infected and tens of thousands died; the country’s medical system buckled under the weight of a mutated virus. One of the most disturbing aspects of India’s surge was that many children fell ill. And yet there is currently no data to suggest that Delta causes severe illness in a greater proportion of kids; instead, it seems likely that the sheer transmissibility of the variant simply resulted in a higher absolute number of infected children. One vitally important finding to emerge from the U.K. and India is that the covid vaccines are still spectacularly effective against Delta. According to one study from the U.K., a full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is ninety-six per cent effective at preventing hospitalizations due to the Delta variant; AstraZeneca’s vaccine is in the same ballpark, reducing the chance of hospitalization by ninety-two per cent. But these findings come with caveats. The first is that, with Delta, partial immunization appears to be less effective at preventing disease: a different study found that, for people who have received only the first shot, the vaccines were just thirty-three per cent effective at preventing symptomatic illness. (A first dose still appears to offer strong protection against hospitalization or death.) The second is that even full courses of the vaccines appear somewhat less effective at preventing infection from Delta. This may be especially true of the non-mRNA vaccines. A team of scientists in Scotland has found that both doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine reduced the chance of infection with Delta by just sixty per cent—a respectable showing, but less impressive than what the same vaccine offers against other strains of the virus. (The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine demonstrated seventy-nine per cent efficacy against Delta infection—a significant, but smaller, decrease.) Taken together, these findings have led some experts to propose adjustments in vaccination strategy. Muge Cevik, an infectious-diseases expert at St. Andrews University and an adviser to the British government, told me that, given the arrival of Delta, it was important to ask “what our main aim of vaccination is.” She went on, “If our primary objective is to reduce hospitalizations and deaths, a first dose still gives very good protection. If it’s to stamp out transmission, then the second dose becomes quite important. I think that, especially in hot spots, we need to expedite second shots.” Others have proposed the idea of mRNA-vaccine booster shots for Americans who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which, like AstraZeneca’s, uses non-mRNA technology. The C.D.C.’s official guidelines tell Americans that “the best covid-19 vaccine is the first one that is available to you. Do not wait for a specific brand.” But that advice was minted when vaccine supply was constrained. The accumulated evidence has led many people to wonder whether the mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer, are preferable to the one offered by Johnson & Johnson, and whether the Delta variant makes them even more so. “It’s likely that J. & J. offers strong protection against severe disease, but because it’s a one-shot regimen it might not offer the same protection against infection for a highly transmissible variant like Delta,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, told me. “A second shot reëxposes the immune system to the vaccine, and allows the body to make even better antibodies.” Rasmussen received the J. & J. vaccine; she lives in Canada, where health authorities have encouraged people to mix and match the vaccines. “I’m considering topping off my immune system with a dose of Pfizer,” she said. “It’s something worth thinking about.” To a significant degree, the emergence of a variant like Delta was predictable, and, with rapid and widespread immunization, the threat that it poses can be subdued. But its arrival is still incredibly consequential. Delta drives an even wider wedge between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. They have already been living in separate worlds, facing vastly different risks of illness and death; now their risk levels will diverge further. People who’ve been fully vaccinated can, by and large, feel confident in the immunity that they’ve received. But those who remain susceptible should understand that, for them, this is probably the most dangerous moment of the pandemic. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media “The good news is that we have vaccines that can squash the Delta variant,” Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told me. “The bad news is that not nearly enough people have been vaccinated. A substantial share of Americans are sitting ducks.” He went on, “We haven’t built a strong enough vaccination wall yet. We need a Delta wall”—a level of vaccination that will prevent the new variant from spreading. “There are still large unvaccinated pockets in the country where this could get ugly,” Topol added. Because about half of Americans are vaccinated, and millions more have some immunity from prior infection, the Delta variant “won’t cause monster spikes that overwhelm the health system,” Topol said. But Delta spreads so easily among the unvaccinated that some communities could experience meaningful increases in death and disease this summer and fall. In America, the speed of vaccination is slowing. In some states, mainly in the South, only about a third of the population has been fully vaccinated. Big differences in the covid-19 toll are already visible: cases and hospitalizations have plummeted in some places with higher vaccination rates but are holding steady or rising in others. Fortunately, nearly ninety per cent of older Americans—the group most at risk for severe covid—have received at least one shot, and three-quarters are fully vaccinated. But, as is clear from the Indian and U.K. experiences, the Delta variant could still lead to major spikes in infection among younger, unvaccinated people. In a recent piece, I likened a society that’s reopening while partially vaccinated to a ship approaching an iceberg. The ship is the return to normal life and the viral exposure that it brings; the iceberg is the population of unvaccinated people. Precautions such as social distancing can slow the speed of the ship, and vaccination can shrink the size of the iceberg. But, in any reopening society that’s failed to vaccinate everyone, a collision between the virus and the vulnerable is inevitable. Because of its exceptional transmissibility, the Delta variant is almost certain to intensify the force of the collision. The U.K., by postponing a full reopening, is trying to soften the blow. But the U.S. is pressing ahead—perhaps out of hubris, or because officials hope that our vaccination campaign can outrun the spread of Delta. Last week, New York and California, among the pandemic’s hardest-hit states, did away with virtually all restrictions. Meanwhile, states with half the vaccination rates of New York or California have been open for weeks. A lot depends on where, and how fast, Delta is spreading. Federal, state, and local officials are trying to accelerate vaccination. Governors have announced incentives such as lotteries, college scholarships, gift cards, and free beer for those who get immunized; California alone plans to spend more than a hundred million dollars on vaccine incentives. The Biden Administration has made immunizing seventy per cent of American adults by the Fourth of July a central priority, and has declared June a “national month of action.” The Administration has offered tax credits to employers that provide paid time off for people to get immunized, erected mass-vaccination sites, sent funds to community health centers, and partnered with local organizations, celebrities, and volunteers to get shots in arms. The White House recently announced that four of the nation’s largest child-care providers would offer free services to parents who want to get immunized before July 4th; Uber and Lyft have been offering free rides to vaccination sites for weeks. And yet, the pace of vaccinations hasn’t picked back up. Topol, for his part, believes that a major impediment to wider vaccination is the fact that the F.D.A. has not yet fully approved the covid vaccines; right now they’ve received only an emergency-use authorization, or E.U.A. About a third of unvaccinated Americans say that F.D.A. approval would make them more likely to get immunized. Full approval could also pave a clearer path for vaccine mandates in schools, businesses, and the military. Topol argues that mandates would allow us to build a Delta wall more quickly—along with walls for Epsilon, Zeta, and the rest of the Greek alphabet. Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for F.D.A. approval, but it’s unclear how soon they will receive it; the usual process takes six to ten months. “Hundreds of millions of people have safely taken these vaccines, but there’s still a perception among some that they’re experimental,” Topol said. “E.U.A. versus full approval may sound like semantics, but it’s actually a B.F.D.” Globally, more people died of the coronavirus in the first half of this year than in all of last year—an astounding fact, given the emergence of the vaccines. The tragic truth is that, for much of the world, the vaccines may as well not exist. On the one hand, the U.S. is vaccinating children as young as twelve; on the other hand, health-care workers, elderly people, and cancer patients in many other countries remain defenseless. Three-quarters of covid-vaccine shots have been administered in just ten countries, whereas the poorest nations have received less than one half of one per cent of the supply. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O. director-general, has called this a “scandalous inequity.” The Biden Administration recently announced that the U.S. would donate half a billion doses to the global vaccination effort; it hopes to deliver two hundred million by the end of the year. The U.K. and other European countries have also committed hundreds of millions of doses to covax, the international initiative to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. These efforts are important, and they will help immensely—but not for months, and perhaps not until 2022. In the meantime, many countries will continue to grapple with the social and economic challenges created by variant-catalyzed surges and the public-health measures needed to thwart them. Even where the political will for continuing such measures exists, it’s not infinite; countries can’t remain in lockdown forever. In a sense, Delta is the first post-vaccination variant. Pockets of the human race—perhaps five hundred million people out of 7.6 billion—are protected against it, despite its transmissibility; for them, the pandemic’s newest chapter is something of an epilogue, since the main story has, in effect, already concluded. But, for those who remain unvaccinated, by choice or by chance, Delta represents the latest installment in an ongoing series of horrors. It’s a threat more sinister than any other—one that imperils whatever precarious equilibrium has taken root. In a partially vaccinated world, Delta exposes the duality in which we now live and die.

India’s Crisis Marks a New Phase in the Pandemic,19413,"Since just before the new year, Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist and economist at Princeton, has been camped out with his family in an apartment in New Delhi. Laxminarayan is the founder and director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy, and is an expert in antibiotic resistance. During the pandemic, he’s been studying coronavirus transmission in India. He works from home, spending nearly all his time indoors until five-thirty each day, when he takes his dog out for a stroll. Together, they explore Vasant Vihar, an embassy-filled neighborhood in the southwest of the city. Laxminarayan’s walks have changed in recent weeks. Coronavirus deaths in India have skyrocketed, and a frightening atmosphere has descended. New Delhi is roughly as dense as New York City, with some thirty thousand residents per square mile. But now Laxminarayan passes just a few scattered people; almost everyone stays inside if they can, venturing out only in search of food, medication, or medical care. Before the surge, mask-wearing had declined, but now everyone’s face is covered again. “You need public-health enforcement when the pandemic is invisible,” Laxminarayan told me. “Now fear is the dominant force changing people’s behavior.” Government statistics indicate that the virus is newly infecting millions of Indians each week, and that some twenty thousand or thirty thousand people are dying weekly. But most experts, including Laxminarayan, believe that those numbers capture a fraction of the true covid-19 toll. “It’s a war zone,” Laxminarayan said. “It’s worse than what you’re reading in the papers or seeing on TV. Whatever the numbers are, they don’t tell the full story. The human toll is devastating.” The current surge differs fundamentally from India’s experience last year. “This is truly a national wave,” Laxminarayan said. “It’s not urban. It’s not rural. It’s not north or south. It’s everywhere.” He went on, “During the first wave, the poor suffered the bulk of the health and economic toll. Now everyone is affected. I personally don’t know a single family that doesn’t have covid in it right now. I don’t mean in their extended family. I mean in their nuclear family.” In late April, after his dentist’s parents both died and after a colleague fell ill and couldn’t get oxygen, Laxminarayan decided to shift from covid research to covid relief. He and his team at C.D.D.E.P. decided to focus on India’s oxygen-supply problem, which has fundamentally limited the nation’s hospital capacity. They launched an initiative called OxygenForIndia, raising eight and a half million dollars in two weeks; with the help of corporate partners, among them Verizon Media, Logitech, and UiPath, they have secured more than two thousand oxygen concentrators—portable devices that remove nitrogen from the air to produce purified oxygen—and thirty thousand cylinders to store gaseous oxygen. By some estimates, those cylinder donations add up to more gaseous oxygen than India has received through foreign aid to date. “Right now, no one wants to leave a hospital bed they’re in,” Laxminarayan said. “It’s the only place they know perhaps they can get oxygen. We want to assure people they will have oxygen at home, so that hospital capacity is freed up for the sickest patients.” Laxminarayan thinks that bolstering critical-care capacity is a long-term proposition—“You can’t make doctors and nurses overnight”—and that India is better served today by making more efficient use of its existing infrastructure. OxygenForIndia has already started delivering oxygen to people’s homes, but the organization’s larger goal is to partner with hospitals in urban areas: Delhi, Bangalore, and Kolkata, among others. Doctors, along with algorithms, will triage patients upon presentation or as they improve before discharge. Those deemed safe to go home with supportive oxygen will be given a Q.R. code to be scanned at a nearby warehouse, where they can collect an oxygen cylinder or concentrator to keep as long as they need. (Cylinders must be refilled at the warehouse each day; concentrators can be used continuously at home.) “I’m hoping this is a scalable model that can be used by other countries when they face their big covid wave,” Laxminarayan said. “Because there’s no reason to believe they won’t.” The air around us, which contains twenty-one-per-cent oxygen, must be concentrated and purified to produce the medical-grade gas that people need when the coronavirus besieges their lungs. The most efficient way to accomplish this—the default in wealthy countries—is for factories to produce liquid oxygen, which tanker trucks then deliver to hospitals, where it can be stored in large containers and then piped into patients’ rooms. Many hospitals in poor countries, however, aren’t equipped to store liquid oxygen, and must rely on an external supply. If a hospital is in a remote location, this can be a serious logistical challenge. Another option is to install on-site plants that extract oxygen from the air. These systems, which use a technology known as pressure swing adsorption, or P.S.A., are expensive, and require maintenance. In October, the Indian government announced plans to build a hundred and sixty-two such plants around the country; thus far, thirty-three have been installed. Laxminarayan’s organization also hopes to create dozens of oxygen-generation plants at Indian hospitals. For now, many hospitals rely on simpler, decentralized technology, which comes with disadvantages: the gaseous oxygen contained in cylinders can cost ten times as much as its liquid equivalent, and oxygen concentrators are usually intended for only one or a few patients at a time. Whatever the process, it’s clear that too many Indians are going without the oxygen they need. Since this February, India’s oxygen requirements have increased fifteenfold; it now needs nearly three times as much medical-grade oxygen as it did during the height of its first wave. Some hospitals have run out of oxygen, and others are on the precipice. Hospitals won’t admit patients whom they can’t treat; many Indians therefore suffer a suffocating illness at home. The government is doing what it can: granting oxygen-transport vehicles an ambulance-like status on roads; leveraging the national railway service to move tankers around the country; enlisting the air force to transport empty containers back to factories to be refilled. On Wednesday, India’s Supreme Court ordered the federal government to present a more comprehensive plan to meet New Delhi’s oxygen needs. Meanwhile, foreign governments and international aid organizations are sending ventilators, concentrators, and cylinders. Still, each day brings fresh reports of people dying because they can’t get oxygen. (The shortage is likely to spread: globally, the deficit of medical oxygen—the gap between what’s needed and what’s being produced—has tripled in recent months, in part owing to the unmet need in India but also because of growing demand in South America and the Middle East.) Technically, Indians have access to universal health coverage: the country’s constitution guarantees everyone a “right to life,” and people can receive care at government facilities free of charge. But, over decades, low levels of public financing have led to poor quality and severe staff and supply shortages. India’s federal government spends around one per cent of G.D.P. on health care—far less than most large economies. Moreover, states share responsibility with the federal government for health-care delivery, and that has resulted in a large variation in funding and quality. Many Indians therefore opt to pay for private health care, if they can afford it, and the private sector now provides most care in India, even though commercial health insurance is available to only a fraction of the population and out-of-pocket costs can be devastating. In 2018, the central government launched a major effort aimed at insuring that low-income people could receive care at private facilities. But relatively few Indians have a regular place of care where they can receive ongoing management of their medical conditions or outpatient testing and treatment for covid-19. The coronavirus has severely strained India’s critical-care capacity, which was lacking even before the pandemic: during normal times, the country has around fifteen per cent of the critical-care specialists it needs. More generally, India has nine doctors for every ten thousand people—about half the global average, and only a third as many as the U.S. There’s also the issue of maldistribution: two-thirds of India’s population lives in rural areas, where only twenty per cent of the nation’s doctors work. (Shortages of nurses and other clinicians can be even worse.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Pandemic Through the Eyes of a Three-Year-Old Still, India’s physician-to-patient ratio is higher than that of Bangladesh, Nepal, or any nation in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of the globe’s myriad health-care systems share the fundamental constraints that have transformed India’s second wave into a humanitarian crisis—including an oxygen-delivery infrastructure that is unable to meet the demands of a vast viral surge. Many Indians have experienced the current surge as a surprise. But the forces driving it are fundamentally familiar. “Society opened up without restraint,” K. Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India and the former chair of cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told me. “It was widely perceived that the pandemic is behind us, that we are unlikely to have a second wave. We didn’t just return to 2019—we entered 2021 with an extra degree of exuberance.” Politicians encouraged people to gather at massive rallies; cricket stadiums filled with fans; malls opened to shoppers and weddings welcomed guests. The government sanctioned the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu religious festival, and millions of people made the pilgrimage to Haridwar, in the northern state of Uttarakhand, to wash in the River Ganges. The festival started on April 1st and continued for nearly three weeks before the coronavirus toll became unbearable and undeniable. Afterward, people carried the virus back to far-flung cities and villages. “The euphoria of putting the pandemic behind us was a widely prevalent emotion, and it suited everyone,” Reddy said. “Industry wanted to get back to full production. Small traders wanted to get back to business. Ordinary citizens wanted to get back to their lives.” Many countries have engaged in wishful thinking during the pandemic; all have struggled to fight the virus while avoiding economic collapse. The Indian experience speaks specifically to the problem of endurance, and raises the question of how long low- and middle-income countries can maintain pandemic protocols absent a clear time line for widespread vaccination. The U.S. and much of Europe have navigated the pandemic while looking forward to early and reliable access to vaccines; if we didn’t have a firm end date, we at least knew that an end was approaching. Under such conditions, politicians and the public can examine, debate, and accept the costs of restrictions. But that calculus is harder, perhaps impossible, without some assurance that pandemic life is temporary. The global vaccination effort has faltered, with poor countries receiving a fraction of the vaccines they had expected. covax, the world’s primary initiative to promote vaccine equity, had planned to deliver two billion doses in 2021; so far, it’s sent out about fifty million. Less than half of one per cent of all covid-19 vaccines have been administered in poor nations. “We’re now in this very strange situation where we’re talking about fourteen-year-olds in America getting vaccinated, while older people around the world remain vulnerable and entire countries are devastated,” Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown’s public-health school, told me. “It’s a moral issue, but it’s also an epidemiological one. We’re placing everyone at risk when we let the virus run rampant. It creates a huge substrate for new variants. We need to quadruple our efforts to get the world vaccinated. That has to be the No. 1 priority for the Biden Administration going forward.” The U.S. has committed four billion dollars to covax, which still faces a funding shortfall of tens of billions of dollars. Last week, the Biden Administration also announced its support for waiving intellectual-property protections for covid-19 vaccines. The proposed waiver—it must be approved by the World Trade Organization—has been hailed by many public-health practitioners; the director-general of the W.H.O., Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called Biden’s support for the proposal “a monumental moment” in the fight against the pandemic. But others have sounded a cautionary note, raising the possibility that the spectre of patent waivers will disincentivize companies from investing in vaccine and drug development in the future. “I wonder whether we want to send potential firms the message that the larger the health crisis, the less we will respect and protect your I.P.,” Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University, tweeted, after the Biden Administration’s announcement. “That’s a great system if you think this is the last pandemic we’ll face.” Jha told me that he worries less about I.P. and incentives than about the practical obstacles to vaccine production. The primary barriers to vaccine availability, he said, are not rigid intellectual-property protections but limited manufacturing capacity and poor distribution infrastructure. Only a small number of companies have the expertise needed to manufacture covid-19 vaccines, especially ones that use new mRNA technology, and scaling up takes time. “The world wasn’t ready to produce five or ten billion doses of covid vaccines,” Jha said. “We don’t just have all this excess capacity sitting around. You need raw materials, production capabilities, liner bags, a whole bunch of complex machinery and supplies.” Absent “a broader package of funding, supplies, manufacturing, and people with technical know-how,” Jha said, waiving I.P. rights wouldn’t help India escape the crisis that it faces today. At the close of the Second World War, much of Europe lay in tatters. Air strikes had devastated major cities. Industrial facilities, roads, bridges, and railways had been destroyed; trade routes were severely disrupted; hunger was widespread; and hundreds of thousands of refugees crowded into camps. By comparison, the U.S. had escaped relatively unscathed—its infrastructure intact, its economic might unquestioned. In 1948, the nation began the Marshall Plan—a more than thirteen-billion-dollar effort to rebuild Western Europe by modernizing industrial and agricultural practices, removing trade barriers, providing direct relief, and stabilizing European currencies. The initiative offered economic and technical assistance to more than a dozen countries—France, Great Britain, Italy, and West Germany among them. In an address, the plan’s namesake, Secretary of State George Marshall, told the world, “Our policy is not directed against any country but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.” The eventual impact of the Marshall Plan remains the subject of debate. Some scholars argue that it was modest, though others note that, by 1952, the economy of every participating country had sailed past prewar levels. But America’s commitment to a more stable, prosperous, and democratic world was widely recognized. Over four years, the U.S. sent more than five per cent of its 1948 G.D.P. to both allies and enemies; the program enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support. Is a Marshall Plan for covid a possibility? The U.S. and other wealthy countries are now approaching an inflection point: with vaccination speeding up, coronavirus cases and deaths are falling across the developed world, even as covid-19 ravages people, health systems, and economies in much of the Global South. In America, the crushing economic and medical toll of covid-19 is beginning to lighten. The war is winding down. Our next pandemic battle must focus on helping other nations cross the finish line. The needed action falls along two dimensions: immediate relief and medium-term preparedness. The former involves a robust, standardized aid package—testing kits, oxygen-delivery devices, ventilators, therapeutics, and vaccines—that could be tailored and sent to countries in need that are facing or anticipating a viral surge. The latter requires investing in local infrastructure for vaccine manufacturing, oxygen production, and public health. As it stands, without massive investment and coördinated effort, billions of people could be left without vaccines, ventilators, medications, oxygen, medical care—and, relatedly, without food, shelter, stability, or hope. America has chosen to be a generous nation before. Will it choose that path again? For Laxminarayan, the pandemic has revealed the best and the worst in people. He frequently gets calls from healthy individuals trying to hoard oxygen. When he asks why they need it, they say that they’re hoping for a kind of insurance policy for the future. “It’s astounding,” he said. “People are dying this second because they can’t breathe, and you’re trying to stash oxygen away for yourself?” On the other hand, he’s been overwhelmed by the outpouring of generosity, from within India and around the world. Donations have streamed in; a network of colleagues and volunteers is working around the clock. Many receive no compensation for their time and effort. “Their goodness makes me cry,” he said. When I spoke with Laxminarayan last week over Zoom, it was past 2 a.m. in India. That was the only time he was available. In recent days, the coronavirus seemed to have tightened its grip on his circle. Two of his friends had lost their fathers to covid-19. Another woman he knows died of covid-19 just after childbirth; her newborn child entered the world without a mother. His colleague—the man whose search for oxygen had initially motivated Laxminarayan to raise money for cylinders and concentrators—had also passed away. Laxminarayan looked tired, and his voice cut in and out over the spotty Internet connection. I thanked him for speaking with me so late, but he waved it off: I wasn’t his last meeting of the night. During our conversation, he twice paused to accept other calls, each time apologizing for the interruption. They were pleas for help. “People are begging for oxygen, no matter how poor or rich, how isolated or well connected,” he said. “In those moments, everyone is the same. They’re scared. They can’t breathe. They need help.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

A Blue-State Thanksgiving Menu,9332,"If we were going to put a pumpkin face on 2020, it would be a frowny one with missing teeth. This has been a year from Hell. The nation was attacked by two plagues: an infectious disease that seemed for most of the year beyond the reach of medical science, and a government led by a delusional and incompetent head of state and his enablers. To have been cursed with one would have been punishment enough. We got two. The Norns really had it in for us this time. Times have been hard, but Thanksgiving is a holiday for hard times. It asks us to remember our blessings. This is something we often forget to do when the sun is shining and blessings seem plentiful, but that is all the more reason to give thanks when skies are dark. The country has been damaged—we don’t even know how badly—but it still has a soul. We should feel gratitude this week for some of those through whom it shone: Health-care workers. The modern Hippocratic oath says, “I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.” In treating the infected, health-care workers were serving the healthy, as well. By September 16th, more than seventeen hundred of them had died from covid-19, two hundred and thirteen of whom were registered nurses. And yet, even as millions of Americans were being given license by the federal government to refuse to take precautions, and even when the President explained to his followers that hospitals were letting patients die because they got more money, health-care professionals showed up. They took responsibility even when political leaders did not. That is the definition of care. State election workers and officials. On November 4th, a couple hundred Trump supporters, some carrying firearms (whom did they expect they might be obliged to shoot?), gathered outside a Maricopa County Recorder and Elections Department office, in Phoenix, chanting “Stop the steal.” Intimidation of this kind was carried out in other states, and received nothing but encouragement from top government officials: from the President and his lawyers; from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who saw fit to place calls to three states to inquire about vote-counting procedures; and from the Attorney General, who directed federal prosecutors to investigate allegations of voting “irregularities” before the results had been certified, an unprecedented order. It was a campaign, still under way, to smear the integrity of people who were working long hours to tabulate votes during a pandemic. When the federal government’s agency in charge of election security signed a statement saying that “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,” the head of that agency was immediately fired. In spite of the intimidation and the smears, the count held, and democracy survived. We owe that to men and women who did their jobs without fear or favor. Anthony Fauci. The President is a destroyer of careers and reputations. That is how he wins policy disagreements. In April, crowds in Texas were already shouting for Anthony Fauci to be fired. In November, the former chief executive of the 2016 Trump campaign posted a video on Twitter proposing that Fauci’s head should be stuck on a pike on the White House grounds. As the Administration purged or publicly undercut public-health officials whose advice the President found insufficiently flattering to his own judgment, Fauci stayed out of the sandbox. He did not change his tune under pressure, and, even after he had been scapegoated and sidelined, he never tried to score political points. He became virtually the only person in the national government whose voice could be trusted. Without his willingness to speak out and his commitment to public health, the past ten months would have been much harder to bear. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Story Behind Presidential Turkey Pardons Philonise Floyd. On June 10th, a little more than two weeks after George Floyd was murdered under color of law in the city of Minneapolis, his younger brother testified before the House Judiciary Committee. In a few hundred heartfelt words, Philonise Floyd gave memorable expression to the emotions of anger, compassion, and grief. He made people feel both that a great wrong had been done and that an opportunity for redemption was at hand. “If his death ends up changing the world for the better, and I think it will,” he said about his brother, “then he died as he lived. It is on you to make sure his death is not in vain.” It was an authentic and eloquent speech by a man who would probably never in his life have imagined himself speaking in front of television cameras to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Nandi Bushell. O.K., she’s British. But the ten-year-old ball of fire’s online drum battle with the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl was somehow the tonic that the world needed. She laughed; she made faces; she stuck out her tongue; she screamed—she embodied the spirit of the music she played. “The Rock Gods of old are happy!” she tweeted, before Grohl conceded. Let Bushell stand for all the artists, musicians, entertainers, athletes, and teachers who made the most of the sad simulacrum for human contact that is Zoom (though where would we have been without it?) and kept art and ideas in our lives. For millions stuck at home alone, they brought a hint of the many things that went missing this year. The pharmaceutical industry. Long one of the world’s least-admired businesses, it nevertheless stepped up to accomplish something few people thought possible this past spring: vaccines that may bring much of the world out of lockdown. Despite ham-handed attempts by the Administration to co-opt the process, the companies that are developing the vaccines appear to have operated independently of politics. Even the decision to announce the results of trials after the election seems not to have been a political one. No doubt the companies’ executives will reap the benefits, but, however much they make, the remedy is worth far more. The New York Times. After being played, four years ago, by the Russians, Julian Assange, and Trump goons like Roger Stone, and covering Hillary Clinton and John Podesta’s mundane e-mails as though they were the Pentagon Papers, the Times dedicated itself to justifying its self-appointed role as “the paper of record.” It patiently enumerated the Administration’s lies, and it tracked the pandemic day by day. It traced the sources of the President’s wealth and obtained his tax returns. It covered the plight of immigrants and the lives of the disadvantaged and, at the same time, ran recipes to try out and lists of movies to stream for its upscale readers. Especially in its arts coverage, it embraced the demand for greater diversity. As its editors would be the first to insist, the Times was not the only organ of the press to rise to the occasion. But, amid a deluge of hype and spin, it kept its head. Joseph R. Biden. He did it. He slayed the dragon. And it was not really a close fight. He flipped five states from 2016, won six million more votes than his opponent, and beat a sitting President. Biden’s previous entries in Presidential primaries ended in early defeats, and every time he opens his mouth, his supporters get a knot in their stomachs. But he ran a disciplined and nearly flawless campaign. He brought together the Clinton-Obama and Warren-Sanders wings of the Democratic Party, something that did not seem to be within the realm of the politically possible twelve months ago. Biden has lost a wife, a daughter, and a son, and he had to hear his opponent carry on about the “Biden crime family.” He had to listen to charges that he was senile, and that his running mate was a Communist and a monster. He did not let these pass, but he declined to return the insults. He let the President punch himself out. There are probably few Biden lines destined for immortality, but, during the first Presidential debate, he spoke for millions when he uttered the words “Will you shut up, man?” They say that there is a man or woman for every moment. Joe Biden showed himself to be the man for this moment. We should give him thanks, take a deep breath, and hope for the best.

We’ve Had Great Success Extending Life. What About Ending It?,24696,"Throughout most of the seventeenth century, residents of London could buy, from street hawkers who fought one another for sales territory, a peculiar sort of newspaper. It cost a penny, sold about five or six thousand copies a week, and consisted of a single page. On one side, readers would learn how many of their neighbors had died the previous week, in each parish. On the other, readers would learn what was believed to have killed them. “Jaundice” was common, as was “Apoplex,” an old word for a stroke, and “Dropsie,” which meant swelling. Other entries seemed to answer the question “How did he die?” with descriptions—“Dead in the Streets” or “Stilborn” or “Suddenly”—instead of actual causes. The deaths were usually assessed and recorded by pairs of older women, who were employed by parishes to go to the local church whenever its bell tolled a death. During one February week in 1664, these searchers, as they were known, recorded three hundred and ninety-three burials across the city. Death causes and counts ranged from “Aged” (thirty-two victims) and “Consumption” (sixty-five) to “Scalded in a Brewers Mash” (one). For the same reasons that today’s newspapers report coronavirus case numbers on their front pages, the London papers, known as Bills of Mortality, became particularly popular when disease swept through the city. During the 1665 plague, Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary about feeling saddened or cheered by the latest numbers from the Bills, while a contemporary named John Bell noted that the Bills allowed people to know “the places which are therewith infected, to the end such places may be shunned and avoided.” But most of the time, according to the London merchant John Graunt, the Bills were little more than matters of curiosity, especially if there were deaths that were “rare, and extraordinary in the week current.” He didn’t consider this to be odd or unseemly. Death, after all, was the most basic fact of life. Eventually, though, Graunt began to wonder if the Bills could be put to “other, and greater uses.” He painstakingly collected and organized decades of the death records, creating long tables of numbers. These first known tabulations of population-level health data are now widely recognized as the birth of epidemiology. Graunt pored over them. What types of death were most common? Which groups did they afflict? Why did some causes spike at certain times, while others stayed fairly constant? And, most of all, what could a lot of separate, individual deaths, taken together, tell him about the society in which they occurred? Although Graunt wanted, as he put it in a treatise, to understand “the fitness of the Country for long Life,” he believed that it was in its deaths that he would find answers. In “Extra Life: A Short History of Living Longer” (Riverhead), Steven Johnson credits John Graunt with creating history’s first “life table”—using death data to predict how many years of remaining life a given person could expect. (One Dutch contemporary, a proto-actuary, took Graunt’s tables a bit too literally, writing confidently to his brother, “You will live to until about the age of 56 and a half. And I until 55.”) In fact, Graunt’s estimates were more of a guess than a calculation: when he wrote his treatise, in the sixteen-sixties, the Bills of Mortality didn’t record people’s age at death, and they wouldn’t for another half century. Yet his guesses about survival rates for different age groups turned out to be remarkably accurate in describing not just London at the time but humanity as a whole. For most of our long history as a species, our average life expectancy was capped at about thirty-five years. Johnson calls this phenomenon “the long ceiling.” Analysis of ancient burial sites, of modern people living in hunter-gatherer societies, and of pre-industrial city dwellers all tell a similar story, Johnson writes: “Human beings had spent ten thousand years inventing agriculture, gunpowder, double-entry accounting, perspective in painting, but these undeniable advances in collective human knowledge had failed to move the needle in one critical area.” That began to change in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In what the economist Angus Deaton has named “the great escape,” average life expectancies broke the ceiling: what had been a very long, flat line finally rose, at first gradually and then dramatically. Between the Spanish flu of 1918 and the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, global life expectancy doubled. These developments, Johnson argues, should be printed in newspaper headlines and hawked on street corners like the old Bills of Mortality. Extra, extra: The average human has received thousands and thousands of extra days in which to live. Johnson tries to account for those days. Which scientific or civilizational advancements should we thank for them? He groups innovations by those which have saved millions of lives (this list begins with the aids cocktail, anesthesia, and angioplasty), hundreds of millions of lives (here the roster goes from antibiotics to pasteurization), and, finally, billions of lives, a small but illustrious pantheon of three: artificial fertilizer, hygienic plumbing, and vaccines. Johnson gives a hasty tour of the stories behind a few of these life-giving innovations. He explains how centuries-old practices in China, India, and the Middle East eventually inspired a vogue for smallpox variolation among the British aristocracy in the eighteenth century—even then, you needed an influencer to start a trend. And he returns to the same well, or, rather, pump handle, that featured in his 2006 book, “The Ghost Map,” about the disease detectives who investigated a cholera outbreak in the early days of germ theory. Yet he cautions that it’s shortsighted to think of these advancements in terms of a few brilliant geniuses having eureka moments. Instead, the innovations that have saved the most lives are the product of piecemeal improvements, built on networks of support and inspiration, and spread by social movements. Most were not blockbuster therapies or expensive medicines but unsexy, low-tech ideas, like water chlorination or better techniques for treating dehydration. Almost none, he points out, came from profit-seeking companies. And many were just advancements in basic bureaucracy—the creation of public institutions that could systematically track health data, require that drugs be tested and regulated, or enforce simple safety measures. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media The most effective changes have to do with saving the lives of children. When Graunt analyzed London deaths, he estimated that, for every hundred children conceived, “about 36 of them die before they be six years old.” Twenty-four more died before reaching the age of sixteen, fifteen more before turning twenty-six, and so on, the rate of attrition falling slightly with each decade until “perhaps but one surviveth 76.” For much of human history, our early years were so stalked by disease and infection and diarrhea that between a third and a half of us never escaped our own perilous childhoods. Especially in the long years before smallpox was eradicated, Johnson writes, “being a child was to forever be on the brink of death.” And the peril was universal. Before the advent of proper hygiene and effective medicine, the children of the élite died just as often and just as early as those of the poor. The rich may even have died more often, since they could pay for the treatments of the time, which generally did them more harm than good. (Readers are given grim descriptions of the illnesses of George III and his foe George Washington, both of whom were made sicker by the “medical” care they received, and reminded that George III became king only because the Stuart line had ended with Queen Anne, a half century earlier. Despite her wealth and power, and despite eighteen pregnancies, only one of her children survived past the age of two—and he died at age eleven.) Extra life was one thing money could not buy. But that equality of loss would soon change. Deaton showed that the great escape was accompanied by another trend, which is now known as “the great divide.” In the past couple of centuries, as changing conditions increased life expectancies within wealthy nations, average life expectancies in poorer ones—the ones bearing the brunt of imperialism, resource extraction, and disease imposed by the wealthy—got shorter. Eventually, average lives lengthened around the world, narrowing the gap, but they still lengthened substantially more for some people, in some places, than for others. “Of all the forms of inequality,” Martin Luther King, Jr., said in 1966, by which time the divide was entrenched, “injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman.” Even in modern American cities, people born into poor neighborhoods can expect to live as many as thirty years fewer than people who are born in affluent ones across town. And that was before the covid-19 pandemic further widened our existing gaps. Johnson includes a few caveats about all those extra days (their unequal distribution; their effect on our overburdened planet), but he can’t help being dazzled by the numbers—that impressive slope as the line on the graph climbs ever upward. When he suggests that the charts imply an unstoppable increase, on the way to an average life expectancy of a hundred and sixty years, it seems at first as if he were joking. He’s not. He’s interested in the transhumanism enthusiasts of Silicon Valley, and the possibility that epigenetics may soon allow us to “turn off” the aging process in our cells, giving us ever more years of life—“the Moore’s Law of public health.” This would transform nearly everything about the structure of the world as we know it, he grants, and create a breathtaking new level of inequality “between the rich and the poor, the immortals and the mortals.” But it’s clear what choice he expects society would make if it had the option. Why would anybody, given the chance to live longer and longer, say no? In October of 2016, a small group of people, many of them elderly women, attended a seminar and a potluck lunch outside Wellington, New Zealand. On the drive home, they were stopped by police officers who seemed to be checking for drunk drivers. The roadblock turned out to be a trick, a way to identify members of an organization called Exit International. Exit, as it’s known to those involved, is a nexus for coffee chats and workshops, online forums and local chapter meetings. Its members, according to the group, have an average age of seventy-five, and many of them are owners of its manual, “The Peaceful Pill Handbook,” which offers details and advice about various methods for ending one’s life. The founder of the group—who is often compared to Jack Kevorkian—and various of its members, scattered all over the globe, are among the central characters of Katie Engelhart’s “The Inevitable: Dispatches on the Right to Die” (St. Martin’s). A remarkably nuanced, empathetic, and well-crafted work of journalism, it explores what might be called the right-to-die underground, a world of people who wonder why a medical system that can do so much to try to extend their lives can do so little to help them end those lives in a peaceful and painless way. Engelhart writes, “It would be hard to exaggerate how many people told me that they wish simply for the same rights as their cherished dogs—to be put out of their misery when the time is right.” One woman, an Upper West Side Manhattanite whom Engelhart calls Betty, was inspired to read the “Handbook” after watching an old friend live into his nineties; in her eyes, he was suffering and depressed, and doctors, whose only philosophy was “Save a life! Save a life! Save a life!,” weren’t thinking about what that meant for him. Wanting more agency to decide when she was finished with living, Betty travelled to Mexico, following the manual’s advice, to buy a stockpile of a lethal drug. She seems excited to tell the story of her illicit adventure: how she bought the drug at a pet store, prepared to “pull the little-old-lady cover” if police stopped her; how she and her two best friends have made a pact for how to use it if and when they decide that it’s time. In recent decades, the increase in life expectancy has triggered a debate among gerontologists: Would the extra years people were living be years of health and well-being? This scenario is known as the “compression of morbidity” theory, according to which improving health would mean that the primary pains and diseases of aging could be squeezed into an increasingly short period at the end of life. The other possibility, known as the “expansion of morbidity” theory, hypothesized the opposite: that more years of life would be achieved mostly through more people spending more time living with pain and disease and dementia. By the turn of the twenty-first century, an editorial in the journal Age and Ageing had noted that the latest trends seemed to be favoring the second theory, with extra years being achieved not through better over-all health but “predominantly through the technological advances that have been made in extending the life” of people who were sick, and experiencing various degrees of suffering. As Engelhart writes, “Increases in life expectancy have been accompanied by more years of age-induced disability. Aging has slowed down, rather than sped up.” This was exactly what Betty and her friends had hoped to avoid. In the United States, physician-assisted suicide is permitted in a slowly growing number of states, but only to ease the deaths of patients who fit a narrow set of legal criteria. Generally, they must have received a terminal diagnosis with a prognosis of six months or less; be physically able to administer the drugs to themselves; have been approved by doctors as mentally competent to make the decision; and have made a formal request more than once, including after a waiting period. In California, Engelhart attends the planned death of an eighty-nine-year-old man named Bradshaw, who is dying painfully of cancer. Bradshaw takes a fatal drug cocktail in the company of his family (“Well, Dad, I love you,” his daughter says uncertainly, as they wait) and a doctor who specializes in just this part of medicine: not saving lives but, instead, helping them end on something a little closer to a patient’s own terms. “Maybe that was a good death,” Engelhart reflects when it’s over. “Or a good enough death. Or the best there is.” Even in this regulated world, there are lots of difficult questions. (If doctors bring up assisted death with their patients, is that discussing options or influencing their choice? How does aid-in-dying interact with hospice? With organ donation? How does anyone really know when the time is “right”?) But Engelhart finds that the world of people who would like doctors to help them die is far larger, and much more complex, than what current laws cover. Venturing into, and beyond, the legal fringes of the assisted-dying movement, she finds people who do not officially qualify for a medically assisted death but long for it, anyway. All feel abandoned by a medical system that they believe ignores their suffering because of what one palliative-care doctor describes as “modern medicine’s original sin: believing that we can vanquish death.” Avril is a woman in England who, entering her eighties, suffers nearly constant pain and the indignities of age but is not actually dying of anything more diagnosable than the slow collapse of her body. “My body served me obediently for eighty years,” she writes, “but is now, quite suddenly, in every sense, unserviceable and well past its sell-by date.” She obtains the same drug that Betty did, and begins to tell her acquaintances of her plans to die. Then, late one night, the police burst through her front door. Medical professionals eventually deem her mentally competent, but the police still confiscate a bottle they find. Maia, a young woman with a severe and painful form of progressive multiple sclerosis, does not qualify; although she has received a terminal diagnosis, her death is not considered imminent enough, regardless of how she feels about the bearability of her suffering. She applies for admission to a death clinic in Switzerland, where laws are more permissive, but then wonders, for years, how she’ll know that the time has come to buy a plane ticket. Another subject, Debra, has dementia, a diagnosis with uncertainties of timing and competence that generally keep it outside the laws governing assisted death. She’s so afraid of her growing confusion that a friend suggests a note for her bathroom mirror—“debra, you are debra. this is your home. you are safe”—but instead she asks a volunteer “exit guide” (affiliated not with Exit International but with another group, the Final Exit Network) to help her die before she becomes someone she fears and does not recognize. A fourth subject, a Canadian named Adam, live-streams videos of himself on the Internet, talking about his plans to take his own life; he wants his pain, which results from mental illnesses rather than physical ones, to be included in Canada’s update of its assisted-dying law. “It’s a no-win situation here,” Adam’s father tells Engelhart. “I lose my son or I watch my son suffer.” Adam’s story is particularly fraught—he has declined some treatments, and seems to be driven, in part, by a desire for attention and by feelings of personal disappointment. (“A life of mediocrity is not worth living,” he writes on his blog.) Engelhart eventually becomes so uncomfortable with her role as a journalist in his life that she cuts off communication with him. But she also finds that all such situations are complicated in their own ways, are their own unique versions of unwinnable. Engelhart gives eloquent voice to different sides of the intricate arguments that ensue when societies decide whether and how and to whom medical assistance in dying should be available. Does excluding people like Maia discriminate against them, as Maia argues, or does it protect them, as many disability-rights advocates contend, from society’s existing discrimination—and from an expectation that they will make use of what one advocate dismisses as “a medical treatment for feeling like a burden”? If people with dementia were allowed aid in dying, at what point in their decline would they be considered competent to make the decision? For that matter, whose choice would we listen to: the earlier, cognitively intact person who insisted that she “would never want to live like that,” or the current one, who may no longer remember feeling that way, and may seem to still find plenty of pleasure in life? And what about mental illness? One psychiatrist, noting that oncologists will eventually acknowledge that nothing further can be done to stop a cancer, wonders why her field keeps trying ever more rounds of treatment, as if it could not come to terms with its own therapeutic limits. During her education, she notes, “there was no discussion at all about whether a wish to die could ever be a rational response to any illness, let alone a mental illness.” That word “rationality” comes up again and again. Doctors who specialize in aid in dying often distinguish between “despair suicides,” the most familiar version, and “rational suicides,” those sought by people who have, in theory, weighed a terminal or painful or debilitating diagnosis and made a measured, almost mathematical choice about how best to deal with it. In practice, though, Engelhart finds that it’s hard to isolate pure rationality; many emotional factors always seem to tilt the scales. People worry about their lives having a sense of narrative integrity and completion. They worry about autonomy, and about “dignity” (this is another word that comes up a lot, and when Engelhart digs in she finds that many people define it quite specifically: control over one’s own defecation and mess). They worry about what other people will think of them. They worry about who will take care of them when they can no longer take care of themselves. And they worry, especially, about money, which crops up repeatedly as Engelhart’s subjects weigh the options that are available to them. Maia says that one of the main reasons she wants to “exit,” as she calls it, is “the pure socioeconomics of MS”: the expensive treatments, her inability to work, being rejected by Medicaid, reading about how often people with similar disabilities end up living in poverty, watching her funds dwindling away. Debra, who is at risk of losing her home because of a reverse mortgage her late husband signed after their medical bills mounted, sends Engelhart articles about the cost of long-term-care homes, and worries about what sort she might end up in. She grants that her decision about leaving the world would be different “if I had money and people who I cared about and cared about me,” but she’s working with the choices she has, in the society where she lives. Given our profit-driven health-care system, highly unequal economy, and hole-riddled social safety net, Engelhart finds herself wondering how often “rational suicide was just a symptom of social and financial neglect, dressed up as moral choice.” The great escape and the great divide, still intertwined. John Graunt is remembered today as the father of data-driven epidemiology, but you could argue that his greatest insight was simpler, and deeper: that you could tell a lot about how people lived within a society by the way they died. He also realized that seeing those patterns offered an opportunity to try to change them. Engelhart cites a survey showing that today about half of Americans feel that patients have too little control over the medical decisions that will determine how their lives end. What’s known as “overtreatment” is a real problem; though most people report a desire to die peacefully at home, one in five among the elderly has surgery in a hospital in the month before death, “often supported by loved ones who would do anything to help and who have come to see any option short of do everything as a kind of terrible abandonment.” America spends more per capita on health care than any other nation—much of it in the final year of patients’ lives—but our inequality and our failures in other areas of public health keep our over-all life expectancy well below that of other rich nations. Health-care-related bankruptcies and what Angus Deaton and Anne Case, his collaborator and spouse, call “deaths of despair” are soaring; suicide rates are higher for the elderly than for any other demographic; doctors report plenty of what one calls “pseudo-conversations,” in which suffering patients ask for sleeping pills or painkillers that both parties know, but do not acknowledge, are for another purpose. People like Betty take a long look at this system and then decide to stockpile barbiturates from foreign pet stores. Behind every fraught ethical debate about physician-assisted suicide stands this inescapable reality: there are many people for whom the way we do things is not working. The right to die can’t be extricated from a right to care. One of the doctors Engelhart interviews—an oncologist in Belgium, where euthanasia laws are widely supported, and aid in dying is legal even for psychiatric patients who request it and qualify—tells her that America is not ready for such laws. “It’s a developing country,” he says. “You shouldn’t try to implement a law of euthanasia in countries where there is no basic healthcare.” Johnson—in the midst of his excitement about that graph of life expectancy, climbing ever upward—pauses for an acknowledgment. If you poll people about their hopes for their own lives, the answer is that most do not actually want to live longer than current natural limits allow. What they want, in the time available, is to live better. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Does Tech Need a New Narrative?,28207,"In 2009, Marc Andreessen—a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and angel investor best known for cofounding Netscape, in 1994, at the age of twenty-two—announced that he would be starting a venture-capital firm. “I’m crossing over into the dark side,” he said, jokingly, to the PBS talk-show host Charlie Rose. Andreessen explained that he would be starting the firm with a longtime colleague, Ben Horowitz, and that Andreessen Horowitz would be “by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs.” Over the next decade, the firm would help fund Facebook, Skype, Lyft, Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack, Stripe, and Coinbase. Its assets would be worth more than sixteen billion dollars, and it would be regarded as one of the premier V.C. firms in Silicon Valley. The firm, modelled after Michael Ovitz’s Creative Artists Agency, had a new approach to venture capital. Partners at Andreessen Horowitz, all of whom were considered area specialists, supported entrepreneurs as if they were Hollywood talent, pitching in with research and recruiting. The company also had a new angle on the media. Andreessen had been booked on “Charlie Rose” thanks to Margit Wennmachers, the co-founder of an influential Silicon Valley P.R. shop called OutCast; Wennmachers soon joined Andreessen Horowitz as a partner. At the time, most startups saw marketing and publicity as an afterthought. Similarly, at most media outlets, tech coverage tended toward dry business reporting, product-release announcements, and reviews of new gadgets. But Wennmachers made P.R. a priority for Andreessen Horowitz and the companies it funded. At her brightly decorated home, she hosted exclusive, off-the-record parties during which tech journalists could mingle with startup executives and founders over food and cocktails. Where venture capitalists had traditionally avoided publicity, Wennmachers encouraged Andreessen and Horowitz to invite media attention. As consumer technologies evolved, so did tech coverage. In the aughts, a slate of tech-focussed blogs sprang up, and the readership for tech coverage expanded. In a study called “Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism,” published in 2016 by the Columbia Journalism Review, the writer and critic Sara M. Watson identified the release of the iPhone, in 2007, as a turning point in the way journalists talked about tech. As smartphones reached market saturation in the United States, tech coverage became increasingly entangled with culture, economics, politics, labor, and media. Ordinary people “were now a little closer to technology” in their daily lives, Watson wrote, and “leading technology commentators celebrated tech’s “potential for advancing democracy and empowering people.” As technology became more accessible, diffuse, and pervasive, technological optimism itself—ted Talks, thought leadership—became a product. In 2011, Andreessen published an essay in the Wall Street Journal titled “Why Software Is Eating the World.” “My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy,” he wrote. “In some industries, particularly those with a heavy real-world component such as oil and gas, the software revolution is primarily an opportunity for incumbents. But in many industries, new software ideas will result in the rise of new Silicon Valley-style start-ups that invade existing industries with impunity.” Andreessen predicted that the decade to come would see “epic” battles between “incumbents and software-powered insurgents.” The op-ed, which was both a prognostication and an investment thesis, was widely read and bolstered Andreessen’s reputation as one of Silicon Valley’s intellectuals—not merely a middleman but a man of ideas. Among other things, this reputation was useful for “deal flow”: it made Andreessen more attractive to both startup founders and investors. In May, 2012, Forbes dubbed Andreessen and Horowitz “Venture Capital’s New Bad Boys.” That same month, Andreessen graced the cover of Wired, under the headline “The Man Who Makes the Future.” Meanwhile, other V.C. firms were hiring their own communications and marketing teams. Later that year, an article in the Times—“Venture Capital Firms, Once Discreet, Learn the Promotional Game”—considered the trend in the context of a consolidating, hypercompetitive venture industry. There were fewer active venture firms than during the dot-com bubble, and over-all returns were low. Institutional investors wanted to work with only the top firms, and venture capitalists had to sell themselves to entrepreneurs, rather than the other way around. Still, the article’s author, Nicole Perlroth, wrote, “the biggest catalyst for the attention-seeking atmosphere, venture capitalists say, has been the rise of Andreessen Horowitz.” If the tech industry was selling itself, journalists on the tech beat were among its enthusiastic buyers. Tech coverage tended to be written from the perspective of the consumer; this worked for gadget reviews but was inadequate for contextualizing the ambitions of companies like Lyft and Airbnb. In a 2020 paper, “Words Matter: How Tech Media Helped Write Gig Companies Into Existence,” the San Francisco-based reporter Sam Harnett noted that tech coverage in the twenty-tens was characterized partly by the unquestioning adoption of industry rhetoric to describe companies offering on-demand services and transportation. Acquiescing to the terms set by the industry, Harnett argued—“disruption,” “sharing economy,” “platform,” “innovation,” even “startup”—also helped “pave the way for a handful of companies that represent a tiny fraction of the economy to have an outsized impact on law, mainstream corporate practices, and the way we think about work.” By aligning with consumers, rather than software engineers or gig workers, the coverage also elided the question of whether companies like TaskRabbit and Uber were ultimately in the business of technology as such. In the media and the imagination, certain narratives became pervasive. Silicon Valley was the epicenter of innovation, home to stewards of the future. Tech entrepreneurs were iconoclastic young underdogs motivated by personal hardships, social consciousness, and sheer ingenuity. Startups were not just businesses but mission-driven organizations that could upend the status quo, connect and liberate humanity, and change the world for the better. An earlier Silicon Valley mythology of post-counterculture nerds in electronics-cluttered garages grew sleeker, slimmer, and better capitalized. The scrappy, Steve Jobs-like obsessive with a taste for high design was repackaged for post-recession millennials. Claims of “democratization” abounded. Mark Zuckerberg became an archetype. Workplace perks and relaxed corporate mores were treated as metonyms for ethics and ideals. Despite a growing body of criticism from academics and writers at Valleywag, the Baffler, Dissent, the Awl, and elsewhere, stories of benevolent disruption were reproduced and reified. Software was eating the world, and the world was going to love it. Silicon Valley is a future-oriented place. In their early phases, startups often look implausible (home rentals), minor (online payments), frivolous (social media), or risky (ride-hailing). A well-crafted narrative about innovative underdogs and counterintuitive but inevitable success was legitimizing. The role played by venture capital itself rarely figured: widespread adoption was seen as a reflection of merit, rather than a function of a funding model that used cash reserves to create new monopolies. By the mid-twenty-tens, Andreessen Horowitz’s marketing strategy had evolved into something like mythology. As late as 2014, Wired was still referring to Andreessen, then forty-two years old, as a “wunderkind.” The Edward Snowden revelations, in 2013, increased awareness of the social and political implications of consumer technologies. But John Carreyrou’s reporting on the blood-diagnostics company Theranos, published in the Wall Street Journal beginning in 2015, was an even more direct hit to Silicon Valley mythologizing. Elizabeth Holmes, the company’s founder, dressed like and had been hailed as “the next Steve Jobs”; a young Stanford dropout, she had appeared on the cover of T Magazine for a story written by Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, Marc Andreessen’s wife. Theranos was the beneficiary of hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding and an abundance of glowing tech coverage. In a profile published in The New Yorker in 2014, Holmes offered an explanation of Theranos’s technology: “A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel,” she said. Carreyrou found that, in fact, the proprietary blood-testing machines that Theranos claimed to have built were a farce; the company was using traditional medical devices and was a fraud. Then came the 2016 Presidential election, in which an outlier candidate, mirroring the rhetorical habits of ironic and inflammatory message-board culture, leveraged social media and targeted advertising to spread misinformation and galvanize his base. The news media began to exhibit a diminished appetite for triumphalist storytelling about tech. New terms, such as “surveillance capitalism,” filtered into the conversation, along with useful concepts (online radicalization) and suggestive shorthand (“the algorithm”). There were still column inches for tales of young upstarts, but they were reduced to make room for reporting on fraud, exploitation, privacy violations, security breaches, polarization, inequity, and discrimination. Many of the new stories relied on employee and worker accounts. In her article for CJR, Watson had identified some tics of tech writing: moral panic, technological determinism, the pathologizing of consumer behavior, and the appeal to readerly anxiety. The new wave of tech criticism exhibited these tendencies, too. To some, the media’s intensified scrutiny was well deserved and overdue; to others, even investigative reporting looked like personally motivated backlash. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Surfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made Wave Toward the end of the twenty-tens, it became unclear whether the world had been eaten by software or simply paved over. Many of Silicon Valley’s most highly valued companies were platforms that aggregated transactions. Often, this meant that they’d built private, high-margin layers atop real-world processes while externalizing the risks. In 2018, a flattering profile of Wennmachers, published in Wired, suggested that she faced a “new and critical challenge: crafting a revamped image of the techie of the future, one that embraces the great responsibility that arrives with newfound great power.” The myth had been distorted; the idealistic, aspirational narratives had not borne out. The industry needed a new story. What might a new narrative for the tech industry look like? In April of last year, as covid-19 cases spiked across the country, Andreessen published a blog post to his firm’s Web site, titled “IT’S TIME TO BUILD.” “Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings,” Andreessen wrote. He went on to argue that certain shameful facts about the response to the coronavirus—shortages of swabs, reagents, gowns, and surgical masks; the absence of a vaccine or treatment; insufficient and inaccessible bailout funds—were not just failures of action and imagination but evidence of regulatory capture, “inertia,” and a “widespread inability to build.” The consequences of this inability could be seen elsewhere—in housing development, education, manufacturing, and transportation. “You don’t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally,” he wrote. “You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.” For many readers, the essay was a sequel to “Why Software Is Eating the World”: both a diagnosis and a mission statement. Among Andreessen’s own suggestions for what to build were scalable universities, digital tutoring platforms, and automated domestic factories. “Why aren’t we building Elon Musk’s ‘alien dreadnoughts’—giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost—all throughout our country?” he asked. (On a 2016 earnings call, Musk had told analysts that “alien dreadnought” was his vision for the next Gigafactory, a high-speed, automated facility for manufacturing the Model 3.) “Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?” A strain of wishful, ahistorical thinking pervaded the essay, which ran beneath a stock image of a futuristic, fictional city with gleaming skyscrapers, a blue, unpolluted sky, and no people. Andreessen ignored the role the tech industry had played in accelerating the erosion of some American institutions; his insistence that building should be separated from politics was strange, given that America’s failures in the face of the coronavirus did not occur in the absence of political will. But “IT’S TIME TO BUILD” also articulated certain undeniable realities. The housing crisis in the Bay Area is as Andreessen described—a nightmare, created by archaic zoning ordinances, nimbyism, an irresponsible tax system, and political gridlock, which has forced many longtime renters out, and makes it “nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future,” or any job. Andreessen was correct, too, to criticize the federal government for distributing relief funds through paper checks, rather than a digital system. At the heart of Andreessen’s essay was an uncontroversial truth: from housing and education to mass transportation, people deserved better. (“Is the problem money?” Andreessen asked. “That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers.”) “IT’S TIME TO BUILD” went viral in tech circles, spawning a small and robust corpus of open letters, Substack dispatches, Hacker News comments, Reddit threads, and tweets. Some readers heralded it as an “instant classic,” “era-defining,” and “a potent call to arms.” Others expressed skepticism and disgust, or published granular rebuttals. Responses spanned the ideological spectrum. Colin McAuliffe and Jason Ganz, at the progressive think tank Data for Progress, suggested building by enabling more public research and development. Scott Berkun, a writer and early Microsoft employee, wrote a blog post proposing free Internet for all, universal basic health care, and a stronger social safety net. In Exponents, an online magazine dedicated to neoliberal thought, Steven Buss, a software engineer and yimby (“Yes in My Backyard”) activist, argued for an end to occupational licensing and commercial land-use restrictions, subsidies for vocational-training programs, and a revamp of the F.D.A., so that it is “permissive by default.” On a panel about the essay, hosted by the Lincoln Network, a libertarian nonprofit that aims to connect Silicon Valley technologists and D.C. policymakers, Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, said that building would be more likely to happen if “policy entrepreneurs” were held in the same high regard as startup founders. “If we think about the success of what might be called the builder movement, that looks like two or three people from Silicon Valley getting Cabinet or Cabinet-level positions,” Lutter said. “Why isn’t Marc Andreessen Secretary of Commerce or something?” Between the alien dreadnoughts and debates about occupational licensing, the discourse around “IT’S TIME TO BUILD” looked markedly different from the idealistic, founder-focussed chatter of the twenty-tens. Taken seriously, the essay seemed to be suggesting an entirely new version of Silicon Valley: a movement away from making software to support existing institutions, and toward creating the institutions themselves. If Andreessen’s exhortation to build was a call for “aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward,” it was also a call to power. The era of the builder may also be the era of the Silicon Valley political actor. At the same time, “IT’S TIME TO BUILD” revealed a certain impotence. The sorts of projects Andreessen proposed don’t really make sense under the venture model; they’re unlikely to be as profitable as the products that have come out of Silicon Valley since the popularization of the commercial Internet. Building may need a different set of incentives, investment models, and values. Of course, it could all just be talk. Media is an institution, too, and one way to change the media narrative about tech is to build a new media. Over the past two years, Andreessen Horowitz has led substantial funding rounds for Substack, the e-mail newsletter platform, and Clubhouse, the audio-based social network. When users sign up for Clubhouse, they are given a list of recommended accounts to follow, which tends to include several Andreessen Horowitz partners; Andreessen himself has five million followers on the app. The firm has about a dozen Clubhouse shows of its own, including “One on One with A and Z,” hosted by Andreessen and Horowitz, and “4B with Margit,” hosted by Wennmachers. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and Musk both made appearances on “The Good Time Show,” a talk show on Clubhouse; one of its hosts, Sriram Krishnan, recently joined Andreessen Horowitz as a partner. In January, Wennmachers published a blog post on the Andreessen Horowitz Web site, announcing the creation of a new in-house publication. “We are building a new and separate media property about the future that makes sense of technology, innovation, and where things are going,” she wrote. “We want to be the go-to place for understanding and building the future, for anyone who is building, making, or curious about tech.” The publication, she went on, would practice “rational optimism about technology and the future”; job listings for its editorial roles explained that Andreessen Horowitz aimed to be part of “the future of media.” Andreessen Horowitz has long maintained a robust content-marketing operation, with substantial blog posts, reports, interviews, videos, and a regular podcast. The firm’s content is often of high quality; it is also—because it is marketing—boosterish, biased, and unaccountable. In the tech industry, brand-owned publications are nothing new. Stripe publishes Increment magazine, Snapchat funds Real Life, and Dollar Shave Club, Casper, Airbnb, Away, and Uber have all run in-house publications with varying degrees of success. Still, some journalists reacted to Wennmachers’s announcement as if Andreessen Horowitz were a new competitor. “Andreessen’s editorial expansion reflects the notion in some Silicon Valley circles that the news media and technology companies are pitted against each other in competition,” read an article in the Information. “This is not a good idea,” tweeted Geoffrey Fowler, a Washington Post technology columnist. “To grow and improve its products, the tech industry needs to be open to more independent views, not more sycophancy.” Eric Newcomer, an independent journalist who publishes a Substack newsletter about venture capital, wrote that the strategy had “dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry.” A couple weeks later, the entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan tweeted, “Over the last year, tech built a Clubhouse-based media outlet that gets interviews legacy media can’t get, and a Substack-based media empire that recruits writers legacy media can’t keep. That’s what competition looks like. Don’t expect competitors to be happy about it!” Other firms have announced plans to get into the storytelling game. In May, Brian Armstrong, the C.E.O. of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange funded by Andreessen Horowitz—it recently went public, at a valuation of eighty-five billion dollars—announced that his company intended to launch a “media arm.” Coinbase’s first initiative, Fact Check, is a blog which comments on mainstream coverage of both Coinbase and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its longer-term plans are unclear, but job listings suggest that the company aims to produce a variety of content for a general audience. Companies, Armstrong wrote, “can create accountability when misinformation is spread via other channels.” He cited Amazon, which now produces and distributes films and television shows through Amazon Studios; Stripe Press, an eponymous, boutique book publisher run by the digital-payments company; and Andreessen Horowitz’s publication. “Over time, my prediction is that more and more companies will go direct, building their own media arm, while remaining focused on their primary goal of building great products,” Armstrong concluded. “The tools for distribution have become democratized, and every company can become a source of truth.” This week, Andreessen Horowitz launched its new media property, Future. The site, which has a minimalist design scheme, is billed as being “by and for the people building the future” and offers a newsletter, a small podcast network, and essays by analysts, investors, and entrepreneurs on topics ranging from supply-chain logistics to blockchain-based fan communities. Many of the contributors to Future have received venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz; these financial relationships are not secret, but they are also not disclosed alongside their pieces. The first batch of essays includes an argument for scaling legal expertise through software, written by the C.E.O. of a startup making “the world’s first robot lawyer”; an explainer of interactive educational platforms for “cohort-based courses,” by the founder of a startup making “the first platform for cohort-based courses”; an argument for restoring domestic computer-chip manufacturing; an optimistic treatment of economic bubbles titled “Well-Behaved Bubbles Often Make History”; and a meditation on the relationships among remote work, migration out of cities, and housing prices, written by a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who specializes in financial services and real estate. By publishing more editorial content, Andreessen Horowitz and others have an opportunity to introduce new terminology, new ideologies, new framing, and new ways for people in and around technology to conceptualize their work. On the other hand, Silicon Valley may have outgrown the utility of an overarching narrative. Categorically, the tech industry is unfocussed: venture-funded companies are as likely to sell microchips as skincare products, medical devices, underwear, new currencies, luggage, or on-demand videos recorded by celebrities. As the industry moves into its next act, tech coverage will likely change in response; the question is whether it will adopt and amplify the stories that venture-funded startups tell about themselves or chart its own path. It could focus less on the idea of building—the storytelling, the sales pitch—and more on what is actually being built. It could demystify the operational logic of emerging technologies and examine the value systems of those who create them; it could be more focussed and precise in its evaluations of how technologies intersect with political, economic, and social life. Watson, in her 2016 study, argued that constructive tech criticism “need not be synonymous with pessimism or opposition, and certainly not with nihilism,” but could start from a foundation of curiosity, generosity, and optimism. She cited Bruno Latour, the French sociologist, who wrote that “the critic is not the one who debunks, but the one who assembles. The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather.” There is some evidence that Andreessen Horowitz is investing not just in the “build” narrative but in actual building. In 2020 and 2021, following “IT’S TIME TO BUILD,” the venture firm announced new investments in a slate of companies, including Maven, an online education platform for courses taught by “creators”; Firstbase, which is responsible for the delivery (and, if need be, the removal) of corporate hardware for people working at home; Moov, which offers “open source banking primitives-as-a-service”; Dyno Therapeutics, a biotech startup applying machine learning to gene therapy; Alpha Health, a maker of revenue-cycle software for hospitals, which automates the insurance-claim process; and Tomorrow Health, a “full-stack, accredited provider that could own the end-to-end home health journey,” co-founded by the former C.T.O. of Casper, the direct-to-consumer mattress company. Last July, Andreessen Horowitz expanded its investment in Anduril, a defense-technology startup that aims to compete with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman by selling products such as the Ghost, a lightweight tactical drone, the Anvil, a quadcopter, and other offerings that the company claims leverage artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. In October, 2020, Andreessen Horowitz announced additional investment in Applied Intuition, a startup making simulation software to safety-test self-driving vehicles. This year, so far, the firm has also put money into a host of workplace-software companies, along with Dapper Labs, a creator of blockchain games and collectibles; OpenSea, a marketplace for non-fungible tokens, or N.F.T.s; Eco, a cryptocurrency platform positioned as a banking alternative; Optimism, an application for making Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster; Carta, an equity-management platform; Chia Network, a blockchain platform; and Talos, which makes software that helps financial institutions participate in cryptocurrency trading. It is far too soon to tell whether Andreessen Horowitz’s investment portfolio contains the institutions of the future, but if the Silicon Valley narrative pivots to emphasize “building”—and this is what building looks like—then the future may be increasingly privatized, decentralized, financialized, and militarized. (Medical billing and remote work may also be simpler.) Andreessen Horowitz is now rumored to be raising a third cryptocurrency-focussed fund, with a target of two billion dollars. For an ontologically—perhaps pathologically—future-facing industry, anything looks possible; it has to. Through networks of wealth and political power, or through storytelling, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors may actually succeed in ushering in a new era of transparent, trustworthy institutions and gleaming, functional infrastructure. And yet, amid the updated rhetoric, it can be easy to forget that venture-funded companies have always been trying to envision the banks, health-care systems, schools, postal systems, and newspapers of the future. To date, they have been only somewhat successful—and sometimes destructive. “Building” would be a new story. But it might not be new enough.

The Biggest Challenge Facing Joe Biden’s New Economic Team,11600,"Traditionally, Democratic Presidents have tended to appoint eminent figures from Capitol Hill or Wall Street to senior economic roles, along with some prominent macroeconomists. The economic team that Joe Biden’s transition announced on Monday is more diverse, and it reflects the evolution of the Democratic Party. That’s not to say there won’t be any people with ties to Wall Street. Brian Deese, a former Obama aide who is set to head the National Economic Council, and Adewale (Wally) Adeyemo, the prospective Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, have both worked for BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the country. Both are key jobs. But, if confirmed, Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Fed, will be Adeyemo’s boss and the first female Secretary of the Treasury. Cecilia Rouse, a highly regarded economist at Princeton, would be the first African-American to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Neera Tanden, the president and C.E.O. of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, would be the first Indian-American head of the Office of Management and Budget. Ultimately, what matters most isn’t the background of Biden’s appointees but what policy measures they promote. The new team consists largely of people who have advocated a vigorous response to the coronavirus pandemic and a longer-term emphasis on raising wages, reducing inequality, and fostering greener, more inclusive growth. (Not coincidentally, these are all key elements of the “Build Back Better” platform that Biden laid out during the election campaign.) In her four years running the Fed, from 2014 to 2018, Yellen stressed the importance of maintaining a tight labor market for raising the living standards of workers, particularly low-skilled ones. Rouse, a labor economist who served on the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama Administration, is an expert on education, and she is also the co-author of a famous paper that showed how blind orchestra auditions led to the hiring of more female musicians. Her colleagues on the new Council include Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who has frequently co-authored editions of the State of Working America, an essential annual guide to economic trends, including wages and inequality, and Heather Boushey, the head of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and the author of “Unbound,” which examined how inequality holds back the economy. Tanden, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, has spent a good deal of time tangling with supporters of Bernie Sanders on Twitter. In terms of policy, though, her views have moved with the center-left consensus. Earlier this year, she published a think piece arguing that corporate governance should be reformed so that “the mission of companies is to focus on workers and their communities, as well as shareholders”—a position also advocated by Elizabeth Warren. Deese, a Yale Law School graduate, worked at the White House throughout the Obama Administration. He helped negotiate budget deals with Republicans and the U.S. entry into the 2015 Paris climate accord. Reversing Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the agreement is something that Biden will be able to get done early in his Administration. The great question hanging over his new economic team, for all its promise and expertise, is what kind of more ambitious aims it will be able to achieve, now that the G.O.P. has won fifty seats in the new Senate and is favored to win at least one of the two runoff races in Georgia. In this potentially constrictive political environment, advisers to Biden have been advocating other policies that aren’t hostage to congressional approval, such as taking steps to reduce prescription-drug prices and forcing federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of fifteen dollars per hour. But the Biden economic team is also keenly aware that many of its policy proposals will likely have to go through, or around, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader. Even in advance of Biden taking office, some of the President-elect’s advisers are hoping that McConnell will agree to a new coronavirus spending bill—possibly as early as next week, when it could be attached to a continuing spending resolution that is needed to fund the rest of the government through the New Year. Before Thanksgiving, Biden publicly called on Congress to “come together and pass a covid-relief package.” In an interview with NPR, Bernstein emphasized the urgency of the situation. “Composition is important,” he said. “Size is very important. But speed is so essential right now.” This warning came as economists at JPMorgan Chase predicted that G.D.P. growth would turn negative in the first quarter of next year. The problem is that the two sides on Capitol Hill are still very far apart. Earlier this year, the House Democrats passed a three-trillion-dollar covid-relief bill, the heroes Act. In October, Senate Republicans tried and failed to pass a “skinny” bill worth five hundred billion dollars. More recently, McConnell has argued that the encouraging news about forthcoming vaccines has reduced the need for a bigger package. Biden and his team are wary of antagonizing Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. But, with the virus spreading alarmingly, jobless claims rising, and the widespread availability of a vaccine at least several months away, they are quietly encouraging the Democratic leaders to come to terms with McConnell on a compromise deal that doesn’t satisfy all of their demands. Such a deal might include extending unemployment benefits, the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, and moratoriums on evictions for renters, and also provide some more help for stricken states and municipalities. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Many independent experts agree that this type of action is essential to prevent another downward lurch in the economy and more human suffering. “We need at least one more large relief package to sustain the unemployed, small businesses, and state and local governments,” Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department economist who works at the advisory firm Evercore-ISI, told me. “Any deal of a trillion dollars or more would be enough to sustain us until the second half of next year. And the bigger the package the faster the recovery will be.” At about five per cent of the G.D.P., another trillion-dollar spending deal would be one of the biggest stimulus packages that the U.S. government has introduced outside of wartime. Given the scale of the shock that covid-19 represents, spending on this scale is entirely appropriate. But getting such a package through the Senate would involve a compromise from McConnell, and so far there is no sign of him shifting. After his well-documented efforts to sabotage the Obama Presidency, many Democrats are understandably wary of the Majority Leader. “If McConnell controls the Senate, he’s going to block the kind of relief package that we need,” Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate in one of Georgia’s runoff elections, told the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent, on Monday. “And that means not just short-term, direct economic relief, but also the kind of infrastructure-jobs-clean energy program necessary to support long-term recovery.” The Biden team is hoping that this analysis is too pessimistic. In addition to getting a covid-relief bill passed before the end of the lame-duck session, the incoming Administration needs the next Congress to pass a spending bill devoted to some longer-term priorities, such as infrastructure and an expansion of tax credits for working families with children. But Biden’s advisers are under no illusions about the scale of the political challenge ahead. If the Republicans win just one of the Georgia runoffs, the filibuster will definitely remain in effect, and the new President will need to get sixty votes to pass any major legislation. In some circles, there have been suggestions that Biden could circumvent this problem by courting a few Republican senators and authorizing new spending programs through the budget-reconciliation process, which requires only fifty-one votes. The Biden team is too experienced to take this possibility seriously. Under the Senate rules, reconciliation requires a prior budget resolution, which would have to be authorized by McConnell, as the Majority Leader. “McConnell is the one who controls whether or not there are reconciliation bills that only need fifty-one votes,” Tedeschi explained. “And it’s very unlikely that he would let a reconciliation bill come to the floor that wouldn’t have got a majority of Republican voters anyway.” If McConnell doesn’t budge, which seems the most likely outcome, Democrats’ only option will be to go around him and win over enough Republican senators to get sixty votes. Tedeschi, for one, doesn’t think such an outcome is out of the question. Many of Biden’s infrastructure proposals, such as weatherizing buildings, installing solar panels, and improving transport hubs, would deliver tangible benefits to political districts all across the country, he pointed out. “While that may not necessarily be decisive to all Republican senators, it will go a long way toward warming them up to some sort of scaled-back infrastructure proposal from the Biden Administration,” Tedeschi said. “It also helps that there are a lot of elements of the 2017 Republican tax cut that are expiring next year or the year after.” Biden could propose making permanent some of the expiring provisions, which include several tax breaks that businesses highly value, including enhanced deductibility for interest payments and full expensing of capital investments. “It would have to be a quid pro quo, of course,” Tedeschi added. Cattle trading of this nature is far from what Biden had in mind last summer, when he laid out his economic program, which also included proposals to raise the national minimum wage to fifteen dollars, strengthen the bargaining position of workers, advance racial equity, add a new public option to Obamacare, and fund more research and development in areas such as clean energy and biotech. That was a different time, when Democrats could still hope of controlling both houses of Congress. After the mixed results of the election, the political calculus has changed. Now the goal of the incoming Administration is to achieve as much as it can and prevent McConnell from blocking progress.

Mike Pence’s Trumpian Makeover at the Vice-Presidential Debate,9066,"In April, as the country’s coronavirus outbreak surged, President Trump mocked Mike Pence’s filibustering skills, presenting himself as a teller of tough truths compared with his slippery Vice-President. “That’s one of the greatest answers I’ve ever heard, because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question,” Trump said in a press briefing after Pence avoided answering a reporter. “I said, that’s what you call a great professional.” Throughout Wednesday night’s debate, Trump’s version of Pence was fully on display, as the Vice-President ducked questions and outright refused to answer them for much of the ninety minutes. Perhaps most significant, given that Trump is currently stricken with the coronavirus that he denied was an ongoing threat to the American people, Pence refused to say whether he had discussed the issue of “Presidential disability” with Trump. But this particular dodge hardly stood out on a night when Pence avoided more of moderator Susan Page’s questions than he answered. The Vice-President began the debate by refusing to say why the United States has had so many more deaths from the coronavirus than other leading nations. He ended it by refusing to say whether he would accept the peaceful transfer of power after the election. In between, Pence managed to avoid numerous other questions, from whether he believes climate change is an “existential threat” to what the Administration’s plan is for providing health care to Americans with preëxisting conditions. For much of the debate, in fact, Pence seemed more eager to deliver pre-planned attack lines against his Democratic opponent, Senator Kamala Harris, than he was to defend the Trump-Pence Administration’s record. Harris, a sharp-tongued former prosecutor whose appointment to the ticket this summer immediately raised expectations for this debate with Pence, proved to be an agile and at times eloquent opponent. She was especially pointed on the subject that Pence least wanted to discuss: the Administration’s abysmal handling of the pandemic. Harris’s first line of the debate was also one of her best, calling the incumbent’s response to the coronavirus “the greatest failure of any Presidential Administration in the history of our country,” which sounds like an exaggeration until you remember that the covid-19 death toll is already the largest mass-casualty event in American history aside from the Second World War, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the Civil War. The only candidate on either ticket who has not held national office before, Harris had the most to prove going into the debate in Salt Lake City, and she did so while dodging a few questions of her own along the way. Do she and Joe Biden plan to pack the Supreme Court in response to the Republicans’ plan to ram through a new Justice days before the election? Does she think Biden has been forthcoming enough about his health, given that he will be the oldest President ever elected if he wins on November 3rd? We don’t know, because Harris would not answer. Both Harris and Pence are younger and far more articulate politicians than their running mates, fully capable of holding their own in a televised argument that cleared the low bar of not degenerating into a food fight at a senior-citizens’ center. The debate seemed sort of normal—at least after Trump’s frenetic performance of a week earlier. But the more I listened to Pence the more I realized that the Vice-President of 2020 is no longer the deeply conventional, if fervently right-wing, evangelical of four years ago. Or even the oleaginous Trump suck-up he has been for much of the Administration’s tenure. He has been changed, and radically so, by his association with the President, and Wednesday night showed something both new and disturbing: Pence has come to resemble a lower-decibel Trump, lying with a fluency and brazenness that might have shocked his former moralistic self. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   Once presented as the acceptable public front for Trumpism to those who might be offended by the President’s grosser displays of ego and misogyny, this new Pence was ruder and cruder, and he spent much of the evening interrupting the two women with whom he shared the stage, refusing to listen when the moderator implored him to follow the rules, and simply seizing extra time to rebut Harris whether Page offered it or not. This Pence was not the Middle American cleanup man of this spring’s anxious coronavirus press conferences; he was nasty, an elbow-thrower who dropped snide references to Biden as a plagiarist, inserted random media-bashing into long-winded soliloquies, and peddled a pet Trump conspiracy theory about the 2016 campaign. Like the boss, he repeated falsehoods about the Democratic platform with abandon—they are going to raise your taxes “on Day One” and “abolish” fossil fuels and eliminate fracking and allow taxpayer-funded abortions “up to the moment of birth”—all of which was not only untrue but so exaggerated beyond the actual Democratic platform that it was hard to imagine anyone but the most diehard Republican believing it. This sounded like Donald Trump talking, not Mike Pence. A quieter, less bombastic Donald Trump, to be sure, but Trump nonetheless. Mike Pence wasn’t the only public official who channelled his inner Trump this week. For the last few days, the White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, has been doing a pretty good impression of the reality-denying President, including misleading the public about Trump’s health in order to leave what the doctor called an “upbeat” impression. On Wednesday, with even basic questions about how and when Trump contracted the illness still unanswered, Conley released an official statement to the public about the President’s treatment for a potentially lethal disease that began by saying, “The president this morning says, ‘I feel great!’ ” That must surely be the first known use of an exclamation point and a quote from a patient in an official medical document meant to provide critical health information to the American people. The good doctor is merely the latest aide in this White House to find out what Pence has clearly learned: when the approach of a President running for reëlection in the midst of a deadly pandemic is to deny its seriousness, then all those in his orbit will be sucked into progressively more humiliating and absurd efforts to go along with the ruse. This was bizarre enough as a strategy back in March and April, when relatively few Americans had yet to die of covid-19. It is more or less politically impossible now, when so many thousands have perished and the United States’ response is a global embarrassment. Trump, though, is immune to embarrassment—his lack of shame has long been one of his political superpowers—and so it must be for those around him. Among the many questions that Pence refused to answer was one of the week’s more obvious, given the large cluster of coronavirus cases in the White House and the President’s own illness after months of refusing to wear a mask or observe social distancing: Why should the American people listen when you tell them to abide by public-health guidelines that you yourself refuse to follow? Pence’s response was a model of misdirection, which had something to do with the Green New Deal and the coming government takeover of health care under the radical-left Democrats. Harris could only look on in amazement, shaking her head at the brazenness. None of it really mattered, of course. No matter how much of a Trumpian makeover Mike Pence has undergone, Vice-Presidential debates do not change the outcome of Presidential elections. This one won’t either. By the time a fly improbably showed up on Pence’s close-cropped white hair and stayed there, without the Vice-President even appearing to notice, for a good two minutes, it was clear who the evening’s real winner would be. It was the fly, who will surely be remembered in debate history after all of Pence’s whoppers are long forgotten. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Biden’s Pandemic Plan Might Just Work,22296,"It is hard to overstate the scale of the pandemic in America. On many days, a quarter of a million Americans become newly infected with the coronavirus, and four thousand die—numbers that dwarf the deadliest moments of last spring. The country’s covid-19 death toll has passed four hundred thousand and, according to Joe Biden’s chief of staff, will reach half a million in February; at any given time, more than a hundred thousand Americans are hospitalized with covid-19, and health systems are running out of space, equipment, and personnel. Meanwhile, a new coronavirus variant, thought to be fifty per cent more transmissible and possibly thirty per cent more deadly than the original, has been discovered in at least nine states. The U.S. has no genome-sequencing or reporting system in place, so it’s impossible to say just how widespread the new variant is, or whether other, more dangerous strains are already in circulation. In any event, the sheer contagiousness of the new version means that the death toll is almost certain to rise further and faster. Vaccines are a reason for hope, and are already making a difference; nearly twenty million Americans have received a shot. But vaccine distribution has also proceeded chaotically and haphazardly. The problem isn’t strictly one of supply. Doses are being shipped as quickly as they can be manufactured, but only about half of the shots received by states have actually been administered. Meanwhile, four in ten people say that, even if vaccines were more widely available, they would hesitate to get innoculated, because they distrust the government and the approval process. Sixty per cent of older Americans—many of whom are now eligible for vaccination—say they don’t know where or when to get immunized. It’s a strange moment in our nation’s history—a contest between error and effort. After a year of mismanagement, America is racing to vaccinate the vulnerable; a new Administration is taking over just as a vastly more contagious form of the virus threatens to accelerate the surge. The pandemic is a juggernaut, bearing down upon us. Can Joe Biden and his team stop it? The new Administration has proposed a wide-ranging, two-trillion-dollar plan to turn things around. The plan includes stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits, a minimum-wage increase, and funding to help schools open safely. But its most important component is vaccination. Biden has pledged to deliver a hundred and fifty million shots in his first hundred days in office; he has also announced that his Administration is nearing deals with Pfizer and Moderna to secure an additional two hundred million doses by the end of the summer. Together with the four hundred million doses the companies already plan to deliver, that would be enough to vaccinate every American adult. But distribution is still a problem. The pace has been accelerating; on several days last week, more than a million Americans were vaccinated. Even at that rate, however, it will take a year and a half to vaccinate eighty per cent of the U.S. population. The pace must accelerate further. The challenges of vaccine distribution are daunting and well known: the need for ultra-cold storage and shipping, the difficulty of coördinating multiple doses spaced weeks apart, an underfunded public-health infrastructure, the politicization of the pandemic, and growing vaccine hesitancy. “The vaccination campaign is going to be among the most complex tasks in American history,” Tom Frieden, who was the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Barack Obama, told me. Still, Frieden believes that, with the right communication, funding, planning, and execution, these obstacles could be overcome. And, because the risk of life-threatening illness is concentrated in certain groups, targeted vaccinations will have an outsized effect on slowing deaths. Nursing-home residents account for some forty per cent of U.S. covid-19 deaths. Frieden said that, if most of this group were vaccinated by March, “You’ve protected your most vulnerable flank.” Biden’s vaccination strategy departs from Donald Trump’s in many ways, most fundamentally in the idea that the federal government should partner closely with states to support the rapid acceleration of immunizations. The Trump Administration largely abdicated its responsibility to support vaccine distribution. “They saw their role as getting the vaccines developed, approved, and shipped,” Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public-health professor at George Washington University, told me. “That is no small feat. But they washed their hands entirely of helping with the last mile. And that’s what ultimately saves lives.” Wen continued, “There’s a misunderstanding of the proper roles of the federal and state governments. You don’t want the feds operating clinics. You don’t want them telling you what to do. But you do expect the federal government to ask states, ‘What do you need?’ You expect it to say, ‘These are the metrics we hope to meet—what can you do right now and what can we help with?’ ” The specifics of Biden’s plan can be divided into four categories: expanding eligibility, creating vaccination sites, bolstering the public-health workforce, and securing production. As a first step, the new Administration will recommend that the states relax their criteria for vaccine eligibility to include all Americans older than sixty-five, as well as essential workers such as teachers and grocery-store employees. Biden’s advisers argue that the initial guidance from the C.D.C., which limited the first round of vaccinations to health-care workers and nursing-home residents, was theoretically sound but practically unworkable: strict eligibility criteria and the limited shelf-life of mRNA vaccines have meant that, in some places, doses sit in freezers or are thrown out, while in others desperate Americans camp overnight only to be denied. (Some medical providers have had to discard vaccines because they couldn’t find enough people who met the eligibility criteria before their doses expired.) Biden’s plan will use federal resources and emergency-contracting powers to support or create vaccination centers across the country. The federal government will deliver vaccines to local pharmacies and cover the costs that states incur when using fema and the National Guard for vaccine distribution. The Administration also plans to launch targeted programs for rural health clinics, community-health centers, and tribal health services, and to deliver vaccines to those living in jails and homeless shelters. This commitment is in accord not just with an egalitarian ethos but with public-health fundamentals: congregate settings are viral hot spots, which, left unchecked, threaten the health of those living in them and nearby. More vaccination sites will require more medical personnel, but state and local health departments have been underfunded and understaffed for decades. “They didn’t have what they needed before the pandemic, and that’s even more true now,” Wen, who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, told me. Although Congress has allotted some funding for states, it falls far short of what’s needed. “It’s been too little and come too late,” Wen said. “We’re months behind where we should be in terms of bolstering our distribution infrastructure.” Biden has called on Congress to provide funding to hire a hundred thousand public-health workers to support vaccination and contact-tracing efforts. That investment would nearly triple the number of community health workers in the country and set a foundation for a more robust public-health system in the years to come. In the meantime, the Administration will encourage states to relax scope-of-practice laws—which restrict the services that various medical professions are permitted to provide—and waive licensing requirements, so that more clinicians, including retired health-care workers, can administer vaccines. Finally, the Administration plans to use the Defense Production Act—a law, passed during the Korean War, that allows the government to compel businesses to prioritize activities needed for national defense—to provide the country with enough vials, syringes, needles, and other supplies to effectively store, refrigerate, and transport millions of vaccine doses. In part, leveraging the D.P.A. is important because it helps insure that people who receive the first dose of the vaccine will be able to receive the second on schedule. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? The Biden plan is bold and comprehensive; it includes many of the measures that public-health experts have been advocating for months. Much of it—invoking the D.P.A., mobilizing federal resources, erecting emergency vaccination centers, establishing clear guidance on vaccine distribution and eligibility—can be accomplished through executive action or the bully pulpit. But other parts, such as funding public-health workers and supercharging vaccine administration, will require support from Congress and coöperation from states. In any event, Wen told me, an effective vaccination campaign will get us only so far. “Vaccines are not going to get us out of the immediate surge,” she said. “The Biden team needs to set the right expectations. Otherwise, people will say, ‘We’re vaccinating all these people. Why are cases still going up?’ The public deserves clear communication about what vaccines can achieve and when they can achieve it.” She went on, “The immediate trajectory of the pandemic really depends on people’s behavior. It’s unrealistic to expect that, when Biden starts to talk about physical distancing, it will suddenly convince everyone in the country to act differently.” The need for distancing has never been greater. America’s vaccination effort is unfolding against the backdrop of a vast viral surge. In December, the U.S. recorded more coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths than in any prior month. Health-care systems are only now beginning to contend with new cases resulting from Christmas and New Year’s get-togethers. Even in optimistic scenarios—assuming Biden makes good on his pledge and then some—the vaccines will come too late for too many: the brutal reality is that, in all likelihood, another hundred and fifty thousand Americans will die of covid-19 in the first hundred days of his Presidency. “The essence of the problem is that, on the one hand, with the vaccines, we have more rationale for hope than we’ve ever had,” Frieden said. “On the other hand, we have to double-down on protection protocols.” Epidemiological modelling from prior epidemics suggests that, perversely, optimism about the end of an outbreak can lead to its persistence; the knowledge that the vaccines are effective may seem to license risky behavior that will spread the disease. Distancing, tracing, isolating: these “non-pharmaceutical interventions” fall within the realm of public health. Under the Trump Administration, the United States went without a national, coördinated public-health response. States have had to bid against one another for critical supplies; testing and contact tracing remain inadequate, and public-health agencies are sidelined. The lack of federal support has been incomprehensible and deadly. Now, as new and more contagious strains of the coronavirus emerge, it’s also becoming clear that the country has no surveillance system to track genetic variants. We’re flying blind—unable to detect, much less extinguish, the coronavirus mutants that threaten to upend the depressing equilibrium we’ve accepted to date. At the center of Biden’s efforts will be a push to harmonize the U.S. response. He plans to create a federal Pandemic Testing Board to oversee the distribution of tests, and his relief plan includes fifty billion dollars for strengthening the country’s testing program, in addition to a call for funds that will create the infrastructure to monitor for new variants. He will ask every governor to issue a mask mandate. The first executive order he signed—the “100 Days Masking Challenge”—requires masks on all federal property; another order requires masks on planes, trains, or intercity buses. He’s called for a “Supply Commander” to work with governors on the coördinated procurement of P.P.E., drugs, and ventilators. He will reëngage with the World Health Organization and other global health agencies. Curtailing the pandemic’s damage will require not just strategy but stamina. Biden must help Americans find the fortitude to muscle through mandates and restrictions until enough of us get vaccinated. This may take longer than we’d like. “We should expect the pandemic to continue to test America for the entirety of Biden’s first term,” Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown’s public-health school, told me. “Life will be much closer to normal, but there will still be challenges.” Even if vaccines are widely available, and even if the majority of Americans agree to be vaccinated, the virus will find places to thrive. “Herd immunity isn’t a magic light switch that turns off the pandemic,” Jha said. “Certain communities will have low vaccination rates, and you’re going to have outbreaks. They will fizzle, because most people around them will be immune, but they’ll still occur and they’ll still cause big problems.” In some places around the country, hospitals will still fill. The threat posed by possible new strains of the virus, which could be more transmissible, lethal, or resistant to vaccines, will persist. Looking back on the past year, one might wonder whether America’s decentralized system and political and cultural divisions render the country incapable of contending with a threat like the coronavirus. The United States has become a bitterly partisan nation, and millions of Americans remain skeptical about the virus and the vaccines. Governors have wide latitude in how they manage public-health threats; the country has nearly three thousand public-health departments, and the power to quarantine rests largely with state and local officials. The absence of a national plan has forced states to develop their own criteria for opening schools and businesses. But, even if more federal guidance had been offered, states would still have been free to go their own ways. And, as the virus finds life in one region as it’s suppressed in another, it’s become clear that the sheer scale of the United States also presents a major challenge: the government can impose some restrictions on travel, but American citizens generally have the right to go where they want. It is, as we say, a free country. And yet it’s not so easy to blame America’s coronavirus failures on its decentralized system. Germany also has decentralized governance, with sixteen partly sovereign states (or Länder) enjoying significant autonomy. But in March, when cases started to rise in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal government and the German states convened to develop a “uniform approach” to fighting the virus. The common guidelines—which were not legally binding—outlined how localities should mitigate the spread of the virus in businesses, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, places of worship, and other social settings. In April, Winfried Kretschmann, the governor of Germany’s third-largest state and a member of an opposition party, contrasted the German and American approaches: “We can see in the United States that some governors are taking matters into their own hands when there is someone at the helm who at first denied all of these threats. Something like that is completely out of the question here.” After suppressing the virus for much of last year, Germany has recently suffered a surge in covid-19 infections and deaths; over time, some states have grown more resistant to public-health measures, which has limited Angela Merkel’s ability to respond. Even so, the German death toll is far lower than that of other Western democracies. German citizens are far from united in their views on the virus. In August, thousands gathered at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate to protest government measures; some claimed that mask mandates were a step toward enslaving the German people. “It’s not like other countries don’t deal with this stuff,” Jha told me. “Protests are not uniquely American. There are large, vocal groups in Germany who think masks are Angela Merkel’s way of stealing their freedom. What’s different is that those people don’t end up having the same purchase on policy that they do in the United States. That kind of crazy, fringe thinking has been infiltrating American policymaking for a while now.” David Gergen, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and a senior political analyst for CNN, has served in four Administrations, for both Republican and Democratic Presidents; since he joined the Nixon White House, in 1971, he has witnessed eight Presidential transitions. He’s convinced this one is the most important. “A transition in power isn’t just about legislation and executive orders,” Gergen told me. “It creates cultural and attitudinal change. It’s an opportunity for the country to reset.” Some patterns are hard to break. Much of Biden’s agenda requires money—and, therefore, the support of Congress. Biden seeks to make huge investments in response to the pandemic’s health and economic damage; he’s called for billions in funding for schools, for health-insurance expansions, for caregiving programs, for paid sick leave, for unemployment benefits, for stimulus checks. Even with narrow Democratic control of Congress, this level of investment will be a tall order. Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, has already signalled discomfort with the idea of more stimulus checks; other Democrats have complained that Biden’s plan doesn’t go far enough. Support from Republicans is unlikely. “It’s going to be very, very hard for Biden to convince Republicans to pass a two-trillion-dollar package,” Gergen said. “They’re going to turn into deficit hawks again.” Without a filibuster-proof majority, Democrats will likely resort to the budget-reconciliation process to pass parts of Biden’s agenda—provided they can hold every senator who caucuses with the party, with Vice-President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. Almost certainly, parts of Biden’s plan will be put into practice, whether through executive action or piecemeal legislation. But much of how the pandemic progresses will be determined not by laws but by citizens. “Command and control is never going to work in America,” Donald Berwick, a former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told me. “You have to appeal to people’s values. You need to help them see why it’s important that we act, together, as a country toward a common goal.” Trust in institutions has plummeted in recent decades, amid a sustained assault on the idea of collective action. Biden, the ultimate institutionalist—he arrived in Washington at the age of thirty and spent the next half century serving in the Senate and as Vice-President—insists that he can return the country to a level of political comity that his critics, and many supporters, claim is unrealistic. He campaigned on restoring the “soul of America”; the central theme of his Inaugural Address was unity—“that most elusive of things in a democracy.” Unlike in other countries, where the pandemic has brought people together, the American experience has further exposed and deepened our divisions. Biden’s task is to educate, persuade, and depoliticize at a moment when the nation’s crises are escalating rapidly. The U.S. economy contracted by about four per cent in 2020, and eleven million Americans are out of work. The country’s democratic norms have been trampled on for four years, and the insidious threat of violent far-right extremism is now coming into view. During the Trump years, we saw what malign leadership could do to our norms and social fabric. The question now is whether constructive leadership can make a compensatory difference in the opposite direction. Berwick served on the Biden campaign’s health-care task force. In the early nineteen-nineties, he founded the Institute for Healthcare Improvement—an organization credited with pioneering the quality-and-safety movement in American medicine—and he has long been considered among the nation’s preëminent health-policy thinkers. In 2010, during a congressional recess, Barack Obama appointed him to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Berwick served for nearly a year and a half but ultimately resigned, when it became clear that Senate Republicans would block his confirmation because he had said nice things about Britain’s National Health Service and committed other ideological infractions. I pressed Berwick on whether he thought Biden could succeed. “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe with strong leadership, and consistent messaging, and honoring of science, and evidence-based plans, and data collection systems that worked, we discover that we’re still just too polarized, our system is too broken. But maybe not. It’s a hypothesis that we haven’t tested yet.” This winter, America will face that test. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

A Fight to Expose the Hidden Human Costs of Incarceration,41138,"In July, 2016, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Baton Rouge to protest the death of Alton Sterling, a Black man who was shot by a police officer after being pinned to the ground outside a convenience store, where he had been selling compact disks. Although the protests were largely peaceful, officers in full riot gear dispersed the crowds and made more than a hundred and fifty arrests. A coalition of advocates, including the A.C.L.U. of Louisiana, filed a lawsuit accusing the Baton Rouge Police Department of infringing on the protesters’ First Amendment rights. A year later, Andrea Armstrong, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans, who had served as a legal observer during some of the protests, co-authored a report cataloguing degrading conditions at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, a local jail where the demonstrators were detained. Protesters were crammed into filthy, overcrowded holding cells and denied water and toilet paper. Some were pepper-sprayed. Others were strip-searched in front of strangers. In multiple instances, injured protesters received no medical attention. The abuse did not result in any deaths, but the pattern of humiliation and coercion witnessed in the jail led Armstrong to wonder what happened when no legal observers were around. In 2018, with support from the Promise of Justice Initiative, an advocacy organization based in New Orleans, Armstrong co-wrote another report, “Dying in East Baton Rouge Parish Prison,” which documented twenty-five deaths that had occurred in the facility between 2012 and 2016. The dead spanned several generations. Tyrin Colbert, a seventeen-year-old, was choked to death by a cellmate while crying out for help. Paul Cleveland, a Navy veteran in his seventies, died of severe heart problems, after staff allegedly left him naked on the floor of his cell; like many men described in the report, he suffered from an array of medical and mental-health issues. Nearly two-thirds of those who died were Black. Most strikingly, nearly ninety per cent of them—twenty-two men—had not been convicted of the charges that had led to their imprisonment. They were pretrial detainees, still awaiting their day in court—a situation that often happens because people cannot afford to post bail. Louisiana, Armstrong’s home state, has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the country. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, it also has the highest in-custody mortality rate. But, when Armstrong began searching for more granular data to determine how many deaths were taking place in specific detention facilities, she couldn’t find anything. Like other states, Louisiana is supposed to report such data to the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance, but advocates complain that there are few repercussions for failing to comply, and the raw numbers gathered by the bureau are not made public. The bureau also does not consistently disaggregate state data by facility and by factors such as race and sex, making it easy to mask disparities. Frustrated that no public database existed, Armstrong decided to create one, with the help of her law students at Loyola. Under her guidance, the students filed public-records requests with every jail, prison, and detention center in Louisiana. This past June, the database was unveiled, on a Web site called Incarceration Transparency, which features an interactive map of Louisiana’s sixty-four parishes (the state’s equivalent of counties). If a user clicks on a parish, the names of the correctional facilities within its borders appear, along with a list of people who have died in those facilities in recent years. Next to each entry are the person’s race and sex. There are links to documents related to each case, including the official death report that detention facilities in Louisiana fill out whenever someone dies in custody. The deaths have also been sorted by cause, such as suicide, accident, drugs, or violence. How many of these deaths were preventable? How often were they preceded by neglect or even abuse? Armstrong believes that the first step to answering these questions is establishing transparency. Like the asphyxiation of George Floyd, in May, 2020, the shooting of Alton Sterling became known to the world thanks to bystanders who recorded what was happening. Most in-custody deaths occur inside institutions that are inaccessible to the public. “Their faces are hidden—deliberately so,” Armstrong told me. “The law shields them from the public gaze.” Armstrong’s database enables citizens to see the human costs of America’s carceral system more clearly. It also draws attention to an issue that has largely been absent from contemporary discussions about criminal-justice reform, which, in liberal circles, have focussed on decreasing the number of people behind bars, either by reducing sentences or by abolishing prisons altogether. Armstrong’s work seeks to shift the focus to the dangerous, at times unconstitutional conditions inside the nation’s penal institutions, where more than two million people are confined. If we believe that the lives of incarcerated people matter, she maintains, we have a legal and moral obligation to make these conditions less inhumane. The lethality of jails and prisons was underscored during the pandemic: according to JAMA, the infection rate for covid-19 was five times higher among state and federal prisoners than among the general population, and an incarcerated person with the virus was three times more likely to die than a non-incarcerated person who got infected. Some of the disparity can be attributed to the difficulty of containing a highly infectious airborne disease in densely crowded cellblocks. But Homer Venters, an epidemiologist and the former medical director of correctional health services in New York City, told me that a lack of concern for the safety and well-being of incarcerated people also played a role. Since the pandemic began, Venters has conducted on-site inspections of more than twenty-five jails and prisons across the country. Officials often assured him that they screened prisoners daily and adhered to the social-distancing guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control, but prisoners told him a different story, complaining that the bathrooms lacked soap and that symptomatic people who submitted sick-call requests were ignored. After four people died of covid-19 at a federal prison in Lompoc, California, Venters concluded that a “grossly inadequate system of health care” had exacerbated the outbreak; his findings were cited this past March in a letter written by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Dick Durbin, calling for the Department of Justice’s inspector general to conduct a review of all covid-19 deaths in federal prisons. covid-19 fatalities are not yet included in Andrea Armstrong’s database. Deaths from heart attacks, respiratory diseases, and cancer feature prominently, however. The vast majority of the deaths listed in the database had medical causes. Some prison officials contend that these fatalities are unavoidable in institutions that house a disproportionate number of people with substance-abuse problems or such preëxisting conditions as diabetes. But Armstrong, who recently published a report that examined seven hundred and eighty-six deaths in Louisiana facilities between 2015 and 2019, told me, “Only fifty per cent of medical deaths we coded were from a preëxisting condition, which means fifty per cent of them were not.” Louisiana has the highest number of people in the country who have been sentenced to life without parole, and many prisoners are dying from illnesses that they develop while serving time. Do they receive proper preventive care, as is their constitutional right? This past spring, Armstrong helped write a report on the quality of care dispensed to state prisoners, and presented it to members of the Louisiana legislature. It included interviews with physicians at hospitals and external clinics who stated that, by the time they saw incarcerated patients, little could be done for them. “I’ve seen way more cases of obvious advanced cancer than I think anyone should see,” one doctor said. “Horrible stories of young people with end-stage cancer that could have been treated.” The report included a reference to Lewis v. Cain, a 2015 class-action lawsuit filed by a dozen prisoners at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola, alleging that the facility had denied them medical care. On March 31, 2021, Shelly Dick, a federal judge, affirmed this contention, in a ruling that cited numerous examples of blatantly deficient care. One case involved a prisoner, referred to as Patient No. 5, who complained for two years about abdominal pain. The discomfort eventually became so acute that the man couldn’t walk. When he was finally taken to a hospital, he was given a diagnosis of advanced colon cancer; shortly afterward, he died. Experts at the trial testified that the man’s death could have been prevented if the diagnosis had been made earlier. Judge Dick wrote in her opinion that Angola’s administrators had been “deliberately indifferent to the inmates’ serious medical needs in the means and manner of the delivery of healthcare,” violating the Constitution’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The ruling on deficient care at Angola resonated with Armstrong. In 2014, she attended a Thanksgiving dinner hosted by friends in New Orleans. Among the guests was Glenn Ford, who was eating his first Thanksgiving meal as a free man in three decades. Ford had spent twenty-nine years on death row at Angola for a murder that he did not commit. He had been released that March, after state prosecutors announced that “credible evidence” had emerged which exonerated him; they neglected to mention that exculpatory facts had been withheld from the all-white jury that convicted him, in 1984. “What are you doing for fun?” Armstrong asked Ford at the dinner. They struck up a friendship, attending jazz concerts at clubs in the French Quarter. But fifteen months after Ford’s release he died, of lung cancer. It was not, technically speaking, an in-custody death, but Armstrong told me Ford was convinced that his disease could have been treated had it been identified years earlier. As Armstrong’s friendship with Ford indicates, her commitment to scholarly rigor does not mean that she remains aloof from the people her studies focus on. When I asked her who had most shaped her thinking about the penal system, she said, “People who are incarcerated.” The voices of people behind bars are often overlooked or discounted, even by critics of mass incarceration, to say nothing of élite law professors. But Armstrong, who is forty-six, grew up in New Orleans, near the juncture of Louisiana and Broad, a stretch of blocks lined with modest single-family homes. The neighborhood was stable, but many of the areas surrounding it, including the Magnolia Projects, a public-housing development a few blocks away, were not, particularly during the crack epidemic, which peaked during Armstrong’s childhood. “It was impossible to grow up as a Black girl in New Orleans in the nineteen-eighties and not know people who got arrested or were victims of crime,” she said. Armstrong credited her public-school teachers with steering her onto a safer path, as well as her mother, who imbued her with a belief in the value of community service, taking her to soup kitchens to volunteer with members of their church. Armstrong joined the Peace Corps after college and embarked on a career in international human rights, but she eventually decided that she wanted to do human-rights work closer to home. After graduating from Yale Law School, she returned to New Orleans, in 2008, where she clerked for a federal judge before joining the faculty of Loyola. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" In person and in her scholarly work, Armstrong expresses her ideas in measured language that seems designed to appeal to people regardless of their backgrounds or their politics. When we met for lunch one day, at Café Reconcile, a soul-food restaurant, she suggested that exposing unconstitutional conditions in jails and prisons isn’t actually political. “It’s about government obligation,” she said. “We have an obligation to insure that justice is done and that every single person in that process is treated fairly and humanely. I don’t see that as a political idea.” But Armstrong also believes that the law has often been used to subordinate certain groups, Black people in particular. Although African Americans represent slightly less than a third of Louisiana’s population, they account for fifty-eight per cent of the eight hundred and thirty-four deaths behind bars that have been entered into Armstrong’s database thus far. “You can’t talk about incarceration without talking about race,” she said. Not infrequently, she noted, her race and gender were the only things that people she met seemed to notice about her. She once went to a courthouse in Baton Rouge to examine some records that she’d ordered, but was stopped at the entrance. “You’re not an attorney,” a white security guard insisted. “I am an attorney,” she calmly explained, showing him her bar card. “You don’t look like an attorney,” he snapped. Such attitudes have not stopped Armstrong from visiting prisons whenever she travels to new cities and asking to survey conditions inside. The walk-throughs were enlightening, she said, but they were so draining that she had learned to put nothing on her schedule the next day. “You’re basically walking around caged human beings in spaces smaller than the zoo, and sometimes interviewing them about their assault experiences,” she said. Armstrong, who is single, has two daughters. John Adcock, a civil-rights attorney in New Orleans who has known Armstrong for sixteen years, pointed out to me that someone with her credentials could easily find a lucrative job at a white-shoe law firm. But Armstrong said, “For me, the work has to translate into service, or what’s the point of it?” She found exposing jail and prison conditions particularly urgent, because “the government has the most power it could possibly have in those settings, with people who have the least amount of rights.” Irecently drove to Baton Rouge to meet Linda Franks, who told me about the last time she saw her son, Lamar. It was May 26, 2015, and Lamar, who was twenty-seven at the time, with a round face and dreadlocks that spilled over his shoulders, had just got back together with his girlfriend, with whom he had a daughter. “He was glowing and smiling,” Franks recalled. Later that day, as he was on his way to pick up his grandmother, an officer stopped him for driving a car with overly tinted windows. According to video footage from the officer’s dash cam, Lamar was told that he was being taken into custody for an outstanding warrant from another parish, related to a five-hundred-dollar check that he had illegally cashed years earlier. The officer seemed almost apologetic, saying, “You’ve been honest with me since you stepped out of the car, and I respect that.” Lamar was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison and placed in one of the dorms, Q-8, where, in the common areas, nearly a hundred men were overseen by only one or two guards, even though violence was reportedly pervasive. Lamar was broad-shouldered and athletic, but he apparently began to feel unsafe upon entering the dorm. According to various witnesses, he started talking loudly to himself and acting paranoid; it is possible that he’d ingested synthetic marijuana, which was widely available in the jail. Eventually he told a guard on duty that he needed to get out of Q-8. The guard ordered him to return to his cell and, when he refused, charged him with “aggravated disobedience.” Two prisoners later testified that the aggression came not from Lamar but from a group of guards, whom they saw beating and pepper-spraying him. (The jail has denied these allegations.) According to a lawsuit filed by the family, no mental-health assessment was performed on Lamar, even though he was clearly distraught; instead, he was transferred to solitary confinement. Linda Franks called the jail every few hours, trying to get some information. During one of those calls, a week after Lamar was pulled over, she was informed that he had been taken to the hospital after an accident. She recalls yelling into the phone, “Excuse me, what accident? That’s my child, and he’s in there for a traffic ticket!” Franks later learned that her son, who had no history of mental illness, had hanged himself in a cell that was supposed to be regularly monitored. Lamar was in the neural I.C.U., and soon died. A warden callously told Linda’s husband, Karl, “It is what it is—your son killed himself.” David Utter, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit, told me, “The official cause of death was suicide, but there’s no question in my mind that the jail killed him.” Lamar’s death was one of the twenty-five detailed in the 2018 report on the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison that Andrea Armstrong co-authored. Armstrong told me that officials at the jail responded to her findings by claiming that it simply held a lot of sick and mentally ill people. But the figures in her database showed that several jails in Louisiana had no deaths between 2015 and 2019. Armstrong called the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison “one of the deadliest jails in the country.” On June 10, 2021, a forty-year-old detainee at the facility, Saul Diaz, died of suicide—the forty-sixth death that she has documented there since 2012. (A jail representative told me that people on suicide watch are regularly monitored, and that “deaths due to violence” are not a problem.) It turns out that there is even less documentation about local jails, and what takes place in them, than there is about state or federal prisons. “We know absolutely nothing about jails,” Michele Deitch, an expert on correctional oversight at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “They are places so intimately connected to our communities, and we don’t have a clue what’s going on in them.” Armstrong said that, when she first began writing about the conditions of incarceration, she focussed on prisons, but, after conducting research on the jail in Baton Rouge, she began to see the two types of institution as cogs in an “interlocking system.” The dynamic is especially striking in Louisiana, which, in the mid-nineties, responded to a federal court order to reduce overcrowding in its prisons by enlisting the state’s sheriffs, who run the parish jails, to take on the excess population. Today, nearly half of Louisiana’s prison population is held in these jails, which receive $26.39 per day for each state prisoner they house—enough money to give sheriffs in rural parishes an incentive to admit new people, but not nearly enough to provide quality medical and mental-health services, much less rehabilitative programs. As bad as conditions are in state prisons like Angola, they’re even worse in parish jails, Armstrong told me, “because, in general, jails have fewer resources.” The absence of transparency is one reason that the stories of people who die in jails rarely make headlines. Jasmine Heiss, a project director at the Vera Institute of Justice, offered me another reason: the families of victims are usually too poor to “hire a lawyer to figure out how to hold the system accountable.” When I visited Linda Franks in Baton Rouge, she told me that even people who do have the means are often reluctant to demand answers, because of the stigma associated with having had a family member die behind bars. “They bank on the fact that I’m going to be ashamed to say that my son died in jail, so I’m not going to tell anybody what really happened—I’m going to keep it quiet,” she told me, while sitting in the hair salon that she owns, a small room with mustard-colored walls on the second floor of a shopping plaza. Several women on hand nodded. Since Lamar’s death, Franks had turned the salon into a gathering place for members of the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison Reform Coalition, a grassroots organization fighting to change conditions in the jail. Franks set out a tray of fresh fruit and passed around a box of tissues as people began to share their stories. Among them was Vanessa Fano, whose brother, Jonathan, was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison after experiencing a psychotic episode. He spent ninety-four days there—ninety-two of them in solitary confinement—before dying of suicide. The Reverend Alexis Anderson, a minister in Baton Rouge and a member of the coalition, told me, “If it weren’t for criminalizing poverty and criminalizing mental illness, a lot of these deaths wouldn’t happen.” In her view, people whose loved ones have died in confinement should be seen in the same light as those whose loved ones have been murdered by gangs or shot by the police. “They’re crime victims,” she said. “And they should have what happened to them acknowledged as a crime.” According to Armstrong’s database, in-custody homicides appear to be relatively rare. Just twelve deaths from violence were documented in Louisiana’s penal system between 2015 and 2019: six in parish jails, six in state penitentiaries. But Armstrong cautions that the accuracy of homicide statistics is open to question, since correctional officials have a strong incentive to cover up these deaths, not least to avoid liability. “Some deaths are coded as medical even though they are due, for example, to blunt-force trauma to the head,” she said. “All the data is subject to bias and coding errors made by the facilities.” (A representative of the Louisiana Department of Corrections vehemently denied that officials falsify data.) Steve J. Martin, a lawyer and a corrections consultant in Oklahoma, has spent several decades investigating fatalities in correctional facilities that resulted from the staff’s use of unnecessary and excessive force. He told me that one consistent thread in the cases he has examined is obfuscation and denial. Martin, who is the federal court monitor at the New York City Department of Corrections and has reviewed cases in more than three dozen states, said, “It is rare that the subject agency will ever acknowledge fault or blame related to an in-custody death from staff use of force. And there are so many avenues for the subject officers to distort and deny.” Often, the problem is compounded by local medical examiners, who have personal relationships with sheriffs and jail administrators. In one case that Martin recalled, security guards repeatedly Tasered a prisoner, causing a heart attack. “That death was recorded as a cardiac arrest,” Martin said. “It was a homicide.” In another case, a homeless man booked into the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles was placed in four-point restraints, even though he had not behaved violently, and was then asphyxiated by a group of guards who kneeled on his throat and torso. “They choked him to death, plain and simple, not unlike in the George Floyd case,” Martin said. Yet an internal investigation by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department concluded that the officers had not acted improperly, since none of them had kicked or punched the victim. According to Martin, officials sometimes justify the application of force by claiming that a prisoner was experiencing a bout of “excited delirium.” Earlier this year, a pathologist determined that Jamal Sutherland, a mentally ill Black man who was imprisoned in South Carolina, at the Charleston County jail, entered such a state during a fatal encounter with two deputies who tried to remove him from his cell. Sutherland died as a result of his “excited” condition “during subdual process,” the pathologist concluded. A few months later, a surveillance video of the incident was released, showing that the deputies had Tasered and pepper-sprayed Sutherland many times before kneeling on his back. “I can’t breathe,” Sutherland pleaded in the video, to no avail. The manner of Sutherland’s death was initially listed as “undetermined.” In June, after his family retained legal representation, an amended death certificate was issued, describing it as a homicide. But more often than not, when a homicide takes place behind bars, there is no video that clearly records what happened. In March of 2020, Jennifer Bradley was lying in bed on a Friday night when her niece called, telling her, in a trembling voice, that she was patching through a prisoner at a state prison in Macon, Georgia, where Bradley’s son, Carrington, had been incarcerated for several years. “Call the prison and check on your son—he got stabbed and they say he’s dead!” the prisoner, who’d got hold of a contraband phone, said. Bradley fell to the floor and started screaming. As she subsequently learned, a prisoner had fatally stabbed her son in the chest and neck during an argument. The attack occurred in a dorm where a hundred and eighty-eight prisoners were overseen by one guard. Bradley heard from other prisoners that her son was left bleeding for at least half an hour before receiving medical attention. Bradley said that no officials bothered to reach out to her—she had to call them. “They just never felt we were important enough to notify, I guess,” she told me. (A prison representative said that the warden had “contact” with Bradley, but wouldn’t clarify who initiated it.) According to the Southern Center for Human Rights, in Atlanta, the killing of Bradley’s son was one of twenty-nine homicides that occurred in Georgia prisons last year; the organization concluded that the conditions of incarceration in the state constituted a humanitarian emergency. After Carrington’s death, Bradley wrote to various officials, calling for an investigation. In a letter to Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, she mentioned that she still had not been granted permission to gather her son’s personal belongings, despite repeated requests. “Governor Kemp, I can’t even begin to describe to you how insignificant I felt they viewed my child’s life,” she wrote. When Bradley and I spoke in June, she told me that she was still waiting for a response from the governor. (Kemp’s office declined to comment.) She went on to say that Carrington, whose nickname was Sip, had been arrested at the age of seventeen, for shooting another boy in the foot during a fistfight. He deserved to be held accountable in some way, she told me, but he also deserved the chance to make amends and have a future. Sip, she said, was a generous, gregarious person who was known for helping other prisoners. After his death, several men who had served time with him expressed their grief and sympathy to her. “It was the first time I cried in years,” one of them wrote. In prison, Sip had obtained a G.E.D., and he had begun to think about the future. He died shortly before he would have been eligible for parole, Bradley told me, at the age of twenty-three. “We were planning this big party,” she said, choking back tears. “Instead, I had to plan his memorial service.” The 2018 report on the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison that Andrea Armstrong co-authored opens with an “In Memoriam” page, listing the names of the twenty-five men who died in the jail between 2012 and 2016. The pages that follow include photographs and biographical sketches of some of the dead. Antwoin Harden had a talent for fixing cars, and was happiest “when he was spending time with his younger brother.” David O’Quin, who had an M.F.A. from U.C.L.A., liked working on his art and walking his dog, Bogie. Armstrong included these details to humanize people who have died in custody, in part because she is convinced that failing to do so has important policy implications. In 2019, she published an article in the Louisiana Law Review titled “The Missing Link,” in which she examined twenty-three states that had participated in the Justice Reinvestment Initiative, a federally funded program designed to help jurisdictions adopt alternatives to incarceration. Many of these states had embraced sentencing reforms to reduce the number of people entering their prison systems, and many had also invested in “reëntry” programs that assist people upon their release. But not a single state had focussed on the living conditions of people still confined. Armstrong argued that this was “the missing link” in the criminal-justice-reform movement. In her view, meaningful reform is impossible without it. “Improved conditions can help break cycles of incarceration, enhance economic and social ties post-release, build equity for disproportionately impacted groups, and ultimately help build a safer society,” she wrote. The urgent need to change these conditions was overlooked, she told me, largely because “we don’t see the people inside as people.” Armstrong has been working on another project that will soon go online: a collection of narrative accounts describing the lives of men and women who have died in confinement. Her law students pieced together these stories by scouring court records and other databases for information about the subjects, and by using such sources as Facebook to track down friends and relatives. Armstrong shared a sample with me. Some featured poems that the subjects had written or paintings that they had made. Others contained photographs of their children or spouses. A few accounts were hauntingly vague. “The Pursuit of Patrick B. Bell” is about an African American man with H.I.V. who died at the age of forty-eight, the day after being released from prison. The student who wrote it was unable to locate Bell’s family members or any property or employment records. He did reach two public defenders who had represented Bell in court, but neither of them remembered him. Bell, the student wrote, was “an unseen specter,” whose traces could be glimpsed only through the few existing records of his arrests. So far, the scope of the narratives project is narrower than Armstrong’s database, focussing exclusively on people in a single facility: the Orleans Parish Prison, a jail in New Orleans with a deeply troubled history. In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont toured the city’s jail and described seeing “men together with hogs . . . put in chains like ferocious beasts; and instead of being corrected, they are rendered brutal.” More than a century later, in 1970, a federal judge ruled that the conditions at the jail “so shock[ed] the conscience” as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. By 2013, the Orleans Parish Prison had agreed to a court-ordered mandate to fix systemic problems, which was precipitated by a class-action lawsuit alleging that the facility was rife with violence and had become a death trap for many detainees. When I visited New Orleans, I met Mary Howell, a civil-rights attorney who has represented several families whose loved ones died in the Orleans Parish jail. In her office, she pulled out a binder labelled “40 & Counting,” which documented some of the people who’d died in the jail since 2006. One person who collaborated with her to track the deaths, she told me, was Armstrong. Howell likened Armstrong’s current project to the work of Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, a historian who, in 2000, published the Louisiana Slave Database, a collection of more than a hundred thousand documents about enslaved people in the state. “It struck me, when Andrea told me what she was doing, that there is a parallel,” Howell said. “These are lost people—lost stories of individuals who have been rendered invisible.” Howell took me on a walk, past the New Orleans municipal court to a gray brutalist building with a boarded-up front door. It was the House of Detention, once part of the Orleans Parish Prison, where some of the relatives of families she’d represented had died. The facility was now slated for demolition. Farther on, we stopped in front of the glass-and-brick Orleans Justice Center, a multimillion-dollar structure that opened in 2015. The jail’s physical plant had clearly been upgraded, Howell said. Whether its culture had been similarly altered was less apparent: the sheriff who ran the Orleans Parish Prison, Marlin Gusman, remains in charge, and, though advocates acknowledge progress, serious incidents—including some fatalities—continue to take place there. (A representative of the jail said that Gusman has “made significant improvements.”) Some criminal-justice-reform advocates fear that focussing on the conditions of incarceration may backfire. Not long ago, Louisiana officials unveiled a plan to build a new mental-health facility for detainees of the Orleans Justice Center. On our walk, Howell showed me the empty lot where they had proposed erecting it. Several community groups had banded together, calling themselves the Orleans Parish Prison Reform Coalition, to fight the plan. “We do not want it built,” Sade Dumas, the organization’s executive director, told me. Instead, the coalition has advocated for the creation of a crisis-stabilization center that would provide services for people before they end up behind bars. The controversy underscores the complexity of calling for improved conditions in jails and prisons, which some prison abolitionists see as a counterproductive approach that will merely set the stage for more carceral institutions to be built. In a 2017 essay in Jacobin, a group of abolitionists argued, “The history of the American carceral state is one in which reforms have often grown the state’s capacity to punish.” Dumas, who grew up in the Lower Ninth Ward and has a brother in prison, understands this concern, but also feels an obligation to people who are currently incarcerated. “Some abolitionists have a very strict lens through which they see things—if you’re not shutting down the jails and prisons tomorrow, your efforts are worthless,” she said. “But there are a lot of people in jails and prisons. To not fight for their lives, their humanity, their dignity is disrespectful.” At my last meeting with Armstrong, she was characteristically diplomatic about such tensions. “I don’t think that prison conditions will improve without abolitionists at the table talking about prisons as a punitive institution,” she said. “And I don’t think that abolition is a realistic goal without the voices of the people who have been inside, who have experienced that day-to-day harm.” The key to insuring that conditions actually improve, she said, was accountability. “Let’s see how the resources are being spent,” she told me. Officials at some jails and prisons in Louisiana, including the Orleans Justice Center, where Armstrong has been permitted to go on visits with her students, seem to recognize that they have an obligation to make their operations more visible. The heads of other facilities clearly do not. Twenty-nine per cent of the detention facilities in Louisiana have not responded to the repeated public-records requests that Armstrong and her students filed. She is now contemplating suing them, she told me. Despite the obstacles, Armstrong is hoping that her database will inspire researchers in other states to launch similar projects. “If we can do this here, with law students—hey, you, in Arkansas and Mississippi, don’t you want to know?” she said. There is certainly no shortage of places that could benefit from such a database. Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer at the Southern Center for Human Rights, has spent much of her career investigating deaths behind bars. She told me that the work has become harder in the past few years, as officials in Georgia, where she lives, have made obtaining documents more difficult. “In the past, you could request an incident report about an assault or death and you’d get an officer narrative, witness statements, after-action reports,” she said. More recently, incident reports have been “scrubbed of virtually all detailed information.” (A representative of the Georgia Department of Corrections said that “investigative files are confidential state secrets.”) After we spoke, Geraghty sent me a series of declarations that the Southern Center for Human Rights had obtained from prisoners at the chronically understaffed Georgia State Prison, in Reidsville, where scores of deaths have occurred in the past couple of years. In one of the declarations, a prisoner suffering from bipolar disorder stated that he had gone months without seeing a psychiatrist or breathing fresh air. In another, a man described being locked for two hours in a scalding shower, with the temperature controlled from the outside by guards: “I felt faint from the heat, and my skin burned.” Geraghty told me that, since 2019, there have been at least twelve suicides and five homicides at the facility. Few of these deaths made the news, which does not surprise Krishnaveni Gundu, a founder and the executive director of the Texas Jail Project, which exposes civil-rights violations in the state’s jails. Between 2009 and this past May, she told me, there were a hundred and forty-three deaths in a single facility that her group monitors: the Harris County jail, where upward of eighty per cent of the people in custody are pretrial detainees. “To put that in perspective, the whole state of Texas has executed a hundred and fifty-two people in the same time period,” she said. We spoke on May 25th, the first anniversary of the death of George Floyd. It had been a hard day, Gundu said, both because it brought back memories of Floyd’s murder and because it made her think about “all these people dying in jails that nobody’s talking about.” In the middle of our conversation, which took place over Zoom, Gundu’s cell phone started buzzing. The caller was LaRhonda Biggles, whose twenty-three-year-old son, Jaquaree, had been beaten to death by guards at the Harris County jail in February. (Jaquaree, who died of brain bleed and blunt-force trauma, was punched so hard that the metal grill on his teeth was dislodged; it was later found by another detainee.) Biggles, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, had organized a protest, Gundu told me. Almost nobody showed up. “She called me after that and was so heartbroken,” Gundu said. “She said, ‘Krish, George Floyd didn’t even die here and the whole city shut down with protests. My baby died right here in this jail and the cops were laughing at me, because we found only ten people to come out.’ ” Gundu attributed the difference to invisibility—“no video, no outrage,” she said. I heard another explanation from Susan Hutson, who until recently served as the independent monitor of the New Orleans police. Hutson is now running for sheriff of Orleans Parish, challenging the longtime incumbent, Marlin Gusman. There is a connection between police shootings and deaths in custody, she said, but the latter don’t arouse the same indignation, because people assume that incarcerated victims somehow “deserved” their fates. Armstrong hears this sentiment frequently. Most recently, it was expressed to her in an anonymous e-mail that she received on Mother’s Day, which mockingly suggested eliminating the enforcement of all laws, so that Black people could “run wild through their communities, destroying them.” Doing so “will have zero effect on me,” the author of the e-mail hastened to add, implying that he lived among law-abiding white people. The e-mail upset Armstrong, not only because it was racist but also because she believes that the assumption underlying it is wrong. In one of her law-review articles, Armstrong cites a study indicating that one in seven American adults has had a family member who was incarcerated for at least a year. Even citizens who don’t fall into this camp pay taxes that are used to build jails and prisons, she noted—institutions that operate in everyone’s name and that implicate all of us. In another law-review article, Armstrong summons the words of the former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger to emphasize this point. When a prison official “takes a man from the courthouse in a prison van and transports him to confinement,” Burger observed, “this is our act. We have tolled the bell for him. And whether we like it or not, we have made him our collective responsibility. We are free to do something about him; he is not.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Deciding Who Should Be Vaccinated First,22318,"Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (A.C.I.P.) recommended that covid-19 vaccines be given first to frontline health-care workers and adults over the age of seventy-five. Earlier in the month, A.C.I.P. had released preliminary recommendations and suggested that it would place the greatest emphasis on protecting frontline workers, in part because those workers are disproportionately members of hard-hit communities of color. But the new recommendations bring the C.D.C. more in line with Canada and the majority of European countries, which have released plans focussing on older people, and which most public health officials believe are likely to save the most lives. I recently spoke by phone with Barry Bloom, an immunologist and professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. He is also a member of the Massachusetts governor’s covid-19 Vaccine Advisory Group. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how the virus has affected different populations, how to balance the needs of older Americans and frontline workers, and whether health officials have done a good job of communicating with the public. What did you think about the latest round of A.C.I.P. recommendations? I’m going to say some simple things. The first premise of all of this is that every life counts equally. That may sound strange, but when you have a scarce resource—and my prediction is that once the vaccine rolls out nationwide, you will see the demand rise beyond what the supply can accommodate—trying to set a value that every life counts means famous people and hustlers should not get in front of the line. It’s an obvious point, but that’s been very much on our minds. Forty per cent of all deaths are from people in nursing homes and congregate settings, and, if the object is to save lives, they have to be given high priority. Second—and it’s particularly obvious now, but was predicted in all the discussions prior to this—we have limited hospital capacity to deal with covid and every other hospitalizable condition. Protecting people who keep our hospitals functioning—which, in the first iteration, in March, was bending the curve to keep the hospitals from crashing—is very much on everybody’s mind here. Hence, people who have face-to-face contact and face the most direct risks with covid had to be prioritized in the allocation of covid vaccines. I think thereafter things become more complicated. A.C.I.P. is now giving more prioritization to people over seventy-five. There’s been some dissent from public-health professionals who think that they should have even gone further with age, like, down to sixty-five. I’m curious whether you think that the prioritization of age has been sufficient. The prioritization of age is so important because people over the age of sixty-five account for about eighty per cent of the deaths. The issue that was raised at the A.C.I.P. meeting that I must say has concerned me is that there was no difference in apparent risk in the data presented by the C.D.C. between the ages of sixty-five to seventy-four and over seventy-five. The one objection that was raised by one of the members of A.C.I.P. was that, if the risks aren’t significantly greater, why not include sixty-five-plus-ers. I’ve thought about that, and the sixty-five-plus age group was not the priority in Massachusetts. We are having a scheduled meeting on Wednesday, as we do every week, and I just think we should rethink that. There are a couple of reasons, in my view, why that would make sense, and one of them is that the risks are about the same. And if the risk is the same, you would be saving as many lives by extending the prioritization to that category. [Bloom added, after the phone interview: “There was a big discussion, and it’s a trade-off, essentially, between frontline health workers who are exposed and the issue of age, which the C.D.C. has released very striking data on—that the single largest predictor of death is clearly age, and single comorbidities are lower than that. So the discussion was: Do you open it up to everyone over sixty-five? The numbers would be enormously greater, and things are going slowly, so, with the thought that the priority was protecting people at the greatest risk of death, start with the seventy-five-plus, then covid workers doing direct-facing care, long-term care facilities, police and fire, corrections, shelters, and home-based healthcare workers.”] The second is almost trivial but really quite important practically. These are clear-cut decisions. You know who is sixty-five, and who is seventy-five. When you get to people with comorbidities, it’s a much more difficult situation to ascertain, and how can you be sure who has high-risk conditions, and whose doctor is willing to write a note that they have high-risk conditions? My sense would be, administratively, to protect the integrity of the program as well as to save more lives, I would like to see us drop the age to sixty-five and prioritize that before we get into high-risk conditions and the issue of categories of essential workers, and that’s going to be, again, a very difficult set of decisions that different states, I think, will value in different ways. Those are hard decisions that affect the integrity of the process, which I’m concerned about. If you want people to trust vaccines, they have to trust the process that enables people to get vaccines, and also protect the people who are at risk, who are not always the people who are prioritized. The preponderance of illness is three-to-five times greater for African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, and they are traditionally disadvantaged. If you have a tool to save lives, and they’re at the greatest risk, how do you do that in a way that is equitable? That’s what our group has struggled with and, I think, A.C.I.P. has struggled with. My understanding is that if you prioritize frontline workers more than people over sixty-five or seventy-five, you are prioritizing more people of color, who have a disproportionate number of frontline jobs, whereas, with seniors, that’s not the case. But the data used by the C.D.C. itself seems to show that you would protect the most number of people of color, too, by protecting seniors, because of how likely seniors are to die from the virus. Is that your sense? VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? That’s my sense too, and so in the age category, for me, it’s a clear-cut decision that saves more lives, and it’s defensible and clear and ascertainable. Beyond that is where things get stickier and, for example, when you get to things such as how to deal with essential workers versus people with comorbid conditions. They’re lumped together in the A.C.I.P. report. That’s going to be dicey, how each state would sort that out. We separated them in Massachusetts, and people at high risk for dying because of comorbid conditions were placed higher than essential workers. Can you talk a little bit about the frontline workers who you think should be at the top of the list? Are you taking anything into account other than lives saved? Are there certain workers who should be protected because of their importance to keeping the economy going, keeping schools going? It is clear that frontline health workers in hospitals are not at the highest risk for dying or getting serious illness. They have protective equipment. On the other hand, they’re at risk every minute of every day, and, when you go through the lists, the physicians actually have a lower risk than the nurses, for example, and other affiliated workers in the hospital. The object there was to keep hospitals open, and that is an independent decision parallel to but separate from just saving lives. That’s what every group that thinks about this is worried about. A big debate in Massachusetts, and I think everywhere, is what the definition of an essential worker is, and they come in two speeds: those with the highest exposure to people with covid—and that’s a reasonable category—but there are also other people, such as schoolteachers, who are unlikely to be at the highest exposure rate, or at the highest risk of dying, and yet the damage that everyone accepts is destroying the socialization and education of kids. I think that every state is having to wrestle with how to evaluate those things, and one ends up with different perspectives in these various committees. Do you lean a certain way about these decisions with lives saved versus other benefits? How do you think your responsibility through? I’m at a place that I think has one of the three best epidemiology and epidemiological-modelling groups in the world. We have data coming in every day from all over the world. We know what the scientific numbers are, and the tendency is to believe that the numbers have to drive things. But I was put on the governor’s group, and there are a couple of things that strike me as interesting. One was that the governor of Massachusetts put together a committee to consider this, as opposed to sitting down with the people in the Department of Health, getting a letter from the C.D.C., and saying, “We will do what the C.D.C. told us to do.” I found that extraordinary. The second thing that I found extraordinary is that the committee is composed of a group of people whom as an academic I would never have the opportunity and privilege to hang out with: a religious leader, the head of community health centers, the mayor of a town outside Boston with among the highest incidence rates of covid infection, public-health officials from the state, the head of emergency planning at a major hospital, a state senator, and a representative from Western Massachusetts, a rural, generally underserved area. When you talk about how you make decisions, that was an experience that I found extraordinary in that I started with the bias that, if you don’t have the scientific numbers, what do you know, and I ended up listening more and learning more—from the concerns and needs of the religious leaders, of the people who run community health programs across the state, the people who knew every case in every district across the state—and coming to a set of values that we could all agree upon. Everybody started in a different place than we ended, and we haven’t ended. We will reconsider the issues and ask whether we’ve done it right. I can’t tell you how many committees I’ve sat on in my long lifetime that have been a total waste of time, particularly in universities. This committee was inspiring. If you go back to this essential-worker-versus-older-people dichotomy, there’s been some sense that, if you give the vaccine to older people, you save lives, but, if you give it to essential workers who are interacting with more parts of the economy, you shut down transmission more. Is that something you’ve been thinking about, or do we not know enough about vaccines and how they will affect transmission yet? I will start with an immunologist’s guess, but not based on any compelling scientific evidence at the moment, and that is, if you have a virus that’s infecting some people and killing them, and there are other people who are asymptomatic, if you protect the people who are going to die, you’re probably likely to reduce the burden of virus on people who are asymptomatic. And, so, whether you produce sterilizing immunity, such that no one gets any virus and has none in their nose, or whether you reduce it to the extent that nobody dies and people don’t end up in hospitals in serious condition—and, by the way, if asymptomatics have their virus loads reduced by eighty per cent—I can live with that. I would find it very strange, though not impossible, if you got total protection from the vaccine but didn’t extinguish transmission, but I’ll give you an example where that is a problem. In the case of polio, where you protect people with the vaccine from getting the virus out of the gut and into the bloodstream and the spinal cord and brain, you still, in the feces, are excreting virus for very long periods of time and contributing to transmission. So assuming that your hunch is correct and this is not a polio-like case, how do we go about this? What’s the lesson? I think that for me and I think A.C.I.P.—and you’re framing the question as an either/or—the highest priority for everybody is to prevent people from dying, and vaccines are likely to do that. The second priority is to keep hospitals open. And now the question is how do you deal with the issue of maintaining society at a functional level, as a different part of the question than the scientific matter of where do you get the most bang for your buck for preventing transmission. If you wanted to only prevent transmission, you would vaccinate high-school students and college students and let everybody else die off, which is what one of the herd-immunity proposals actually ended up looking like to me. I don’t think that’s the highest priority. I think that, if young people are going to get infected and they transmit and they don’t die, to me, that’s a lesser priority than if people get infected and die, and we can prevent that. If we’re less efficient when we get down to the lower-age groups, that’s fine. What we’re all talking about here is the assumption that everybody is going to be offered a vaccine. We’re only dealing with the transient period, which I hope is short, of six to eight to nine months, before everybody has that opportunity. These are not permanent positions—that you will not get the vaccine because you’re not an important-enough worker. It seemed to me as if A.C.I.P. backtracked a little bit from its early-December presentation. I don’t know whether that’s because there was some degree of public criticism or there was private criticism, or just the fact that the data has got clearer. But it seems that some of the public-health messages from official sources—and I’m not talking about political leaders, because obviously we agree on the disaster that that’s been—has been not great. The greatest domestic vaccine-advocacy program ever, in my knowledge and in my experience, was the March of Dimes, which ultimately wiped out polio in the United States. It was totally nongovernmental and private. It was part of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, a completely independent N.G.O. that had the best social-marketing ever put to use in public health in this country and perhaps anywhere. I have followed, for the last forty years, public-service announcements from the C.D.C., and they work really hard to get the most accurate, most clear-cut, most definitive data out in a way that is seldom inspiring or motivating. That’s their job. Their job is not to make mistakes and have reporters say they were inconsistent between one talk and the next. That’s the world they live in. I was on a Webinar at the school, and I lost it when I was asked what would I most wish for. I would most wish for advertisements for vaccines during the halftime in N.F.L. games, instead of beer ads and plaque-psoriasis drugs. That being said, I am heartened by the fact that the Ad Council, which knows how to sell plaque-psoriasis drugs, has a big program planned to be released. I know nothing more about that, but getting that to communities in language that they can accept in a much better way than a handout from the C.D.C. is the only way we’re going to get real coverage in the places we need it. It isn’t meant to be critical of the C.D.C. They have a job, and they have scientific and ethical constraints, but they don’t have the tools of social marketing to be able do the things that the private sector does every day but has been utterly uninvolved in, to my knowledge, up to this point. Well, that was a nice story, but also somewhat of a dodge, I think. I think it wasn’t a dodge. Have they been good or bad at the messaging, and I think my answer was that they’ve never been good at messaging that is motivating, so this doesn’t surprise me. Have they been less good in this context than they were in childhood immunization? Yes, because they have been under pressures and threats and probably interventions of which I am not directly aware but I read about, such that they couldn’t even do what they usually do to get out factual information, and they were compromised by the political situation, which I’m sure has made serious and good people here really feel terrible. There was a New York Times story a couple of weeks ago that was somewhat controversial, with some quotes about the importance of social justice, given the effect that the virus has had, especially on nonwhite communities. Do you think there has been any politicization coming from the left? I am concerned about the integrity of the process. The process should be as much as possible an evidence and data-based set of priorities, based on who is greatest at risk, how individuals can benefit, and how society can benefit. The prioritization of vulnerable populations should be based on data. We should not be about making decisions based on an abstract notion of racial justice. That’s not what we are about here. But many nonwhite people have three-to-five times higher risk of hospitalization, infection, and serious disease, and many of them are in high-risk groups even if they are not over seventy-five. If you start with the ethical guidelines for providing any medical intervention to people, there are issues such as beneficence, fairness, and equity—and particularly acutely in the interventions with scarce resources. How do you do that without having racial or social biases? The C.D.C. has tried to do that, I believe fairly, by the only way science can do it—collecting numbers. Who dies first, who dies second, who dies third? Who has the highest risk of disease per hundred thousand people? Those numbers tell you two things: over the age of sixty-five, you have a high risk of dying; if you are African-American or Hispanic or Native American in America, you have a higher risk per hundred thousand people of being hospitalized, getting sick, or dying. Those are the numbers. That strikes me as not biased but saying, with limited resources, how do you prioritize their application? Every state that deals with this is trying to cope with that. We know that in the normal course of events, more-affluent and better-educated people have the greatest access to limited resources, and equity is a priority in providing health care. That’s why we’re in public health. Everybody’s life counts. That’s how I started the conversation. I would ask you to look into the Social Vulnerability Index that the C.D.C. has, which is a measure of multiple parameters that lead to disadvantage, with respect to the health of various communities, which predominantly are racial and ethnic. What Massachusetts did that I thought was extremely edifying for a scientist like me is that it imposed that, by count, on every district in Massachusetts. We saw where the Social Vulnerability Index would prioritize, within any phase or category of our patients, the first use or distribution of those vaccines. The state then came up with where the burden of covid is, where are the most people testing positive for covid. And this isn’t perfect, but they are not coincident. The advisory group that I serve on asked the state authorities to blend the two, to incorporate the Social Vulnerability Index and the places that are suffering at the moment, which they did. That’s the best that you can do. It’s based on real numbers to deal with a real problem. To ignore the problem and say everybody gets treated equally—we know what that leads to. The rich and the affluent get the first shot. I’m not an expert on Massachusetts, on what you guys have done, but my sense is that you’ve put a higher priority on prisoners than other places, including the C.D.C., have. Can you explain very quickly to people why this is so important? I believe the greatest single outbreak in the United States has occurred in a prison system, and the reason I believe that is one of the speeches at A.C.I.P. was by the physician who heads the medical services for federal prisons, who made a powerful case that the conditions in the prisons, from ventilation to exposure to having to eat in common rooms, with very little other choice, were such that these people were at enormously high risk, and that meant that the communities which housed them had workers at every level who were at risk. Prisons had to be protected because they were essentially at the same rate of illness as people in nursing homes. Massachusetts puts them in the same category as people at the highest risk in nursing homes and frontline health workers, to protect communities as well as the workers and the incarcerated, too. But there’s a big difference between jails and prisons. Jail residencies turn over fifty per cent every week. People are going in and out of jails all the time, and I don’t know how to deal with that. I think that, with prisons, where people are really in constant constrained contact, our decision was right, that those people are at an enormous risk, as are their communities and community workers.

Black America Has Reason to Question Authorities,19994,"By Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor On the grounds of the Chelten Hills Cemetery, in West Oak Lane, Philadelphia, not far from where I live, brightly colored helium balloons stretch toward the sky, and fresh mounds of light-brown dirt mingle with brilliant potted flowers. These days, the cemetery hums with families, who stagger to and from the plots, holding their relatives. Their presence is a sombre reminder of how and where the pandemic has swept most furiously through this city. East and West Oak Lane are ninety-five-per-cent Black and brown, and account for hundreds of hospitalizations and dozens of deaths caused by the spread of covid-19. Across Philadelphia, two thousand four hundred and fifty people have died from covid-19; in a city where African-Americans are forty-four per cent of the population, forty-seven per cent of the dead are Black. Within weeks of covid-19’s emergence in the United States, its disproportionate devastation in Black communities became a leading story. Across the country, it remains a disease that is killing African-Americans and Native Americans faster than others. Fifty thousand African-Americans have died from covid-19. Black people account for eighteen per cent of those who have died from covid-19 complications, far higher than their thirteen per cent of the national population. Even in Alaska, African-Americans are dying because of covid-19 at a rate higher than their proportion in the state. But even as a vaccine has been produced in record time, bringing with it some sense that the end of the pandemic nightmare is even thinkable, African-Americans have expressed the greatest skepticism about being vaccinated. The latest polls show that only forty-two per cent of Black people will seek out the vaccine immediately, compared to sixty-one per cent of Latinos and sixty-three per cent of whites. The skepticism among the Black public is not rooted in the same kind of anti-scientific sentiment that has motivated those small communities that reject vaccines in general. Instead, Black concerns are enmeshed within a history of Black health care that is replete with acts of cruelty and depravity and has caused Black communities to regard the health-care professions with warranted suspicion. More important, racism in the provision of medical treatment in the United States has tainted the ways that health-care professionals view Black suffering and symptoms, and Black bodies, more generally. A 2016 study of more than two hundred white medical students and residents found that half of them believed that there are biological differences between Black and white people. One of those perceived differences was that Black people feel less pain than white people—a bias that persists even when the patients are children. According to a 2015 study, Black youngsters experiencing acute appendicitis were “significantly” less likely to receive opioids than their white peers. Nearly two decades ago, the National Academy of Medicine released a landmark study, called “Unequal Treatment,” which found that “racial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality health care than white people—even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions are comparable.” The study identified an “uncomfortable reality”: that “some people in the United States were more likely to die from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes simply because of their race or ethnicity, not just because they lack access to health care.” When coupled with the realities that Black people experience greater unemployment, are poorer, and have significantly less accumulated wealth, that bias is corrosive in maintaining a good health-care regimen. These dynamics sharpen when one considers that many people with limited access to for-profit health care delay treatment or ignore their health-care needs altogether because of the expense. Taken together, these factors explain the greater vulnerability of African-Americans to the worst effects of covid-19. But it is the involvement of the federal government in the distribution of covid-19 vaccines that may raise the biggest question for the Black public. Some of the most outrageous acts of medical abuse directed at Black communities have been orchestrated by state-led entities. The Tuskegee experiment was initiated in 1932, when the U.S. Public Health Service recruited six hundred men from Macon County, Alabama, which at the time had the highest rates of syphilis in the United States. Of those recruited, three hundred and ninety-nine had been diagnosed with syphilis; the other two hundred and one were not sick and functioned as an unknowing control group. None of the men consented to being enrolled in a study; instead, they were told that they were being treated for an ill-defined “bad blood.” In fact, they were not being treated for anything, including syphilis, because the actual objective of the study was to examine the untreated progression of the disease. Indeed, the most thorough examination could only come through death and autopsy. Even when treatments did develop, including the discovery that penicillin could effectively treat syphilis, the men continued to go untreated. Not only did this threaten the lives of the Black men enrolled in the experiment but it meant that those who were infected unknowingly passed the disease to their sexual partners, leading to cases of congenital syphilis among their children. The study came to a disgraceful end in July of 1972, when it was exposed by a front-page story in the New York Times. The federal government paid an appallingly low ten-million-dollar settlement to the survivors in 1974, and President Bill Clinton apologized on behalf of the federal government in 1997. None of this is ancient history. It is so recent that the last survivor of the experiment—a member of the control group—died in 2004. This was hardly an isolated incident of government officials overlapping with health-care professionals in abuse of Black patients. There is an entirely separate history of local and federal officials sterilizing poor and working-class Black and Puerto Rican women. The scholars Harriet A. Washington and Dorothy Roberts have systematically chronicled the terrible ways that Black people, especially Black women, have been abused by government-endorsed health-care professionals. As Roberts wrote in her devastating book “Killing the Black Body,” “During the 1970s sterilization became the most rapidly growing form of birth control in the United States, rising from 200,000 cases in 1970 to over 700,000 in 1980. It was a common belief among Blacks in the South that Black women were routinely sterilized without their informed consent and for no valid medical reason. Teaching hospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on poor Black women as practice for their medical residents. This sort of abuse was so widespread in the South that these operations came to be known as ‘Mississippi appendectomies.’ ” The civil-rights legend Fannie Lou Hamer recounted that, in 1961, she went to have a uterine tumor removed at the North Sunflower County Hospital, in Mississippi. Instead she was sterilized by tubal ligation. According to Washington, sixty per cent of Black women surveyed in Sunflower County said that they had experienced postpartum hysterectomies. These coercive practices were hardly confined to Mississippi. Between 1929 and 1974, North Carolina forcibly sterilized more than seven thousand women, thirty-nine per cent of whom were African-American. The same year that the North Carolina program ended, the Southern Poverty Law Center sued Alabama on behalf of two sisters, Mary Alice and Minnie Relf. Their mother, poor, Black, and illiterate, had signed a piece of paper with an “X” that allowed the state to sterilize her daughters. The lawsuit revealed that between a hundred thousand and a hundred and fifty thousand women were being sterilized annually through federally funded programs. Half of those women sterilized were African-American. It would be easy to assume that this kind of misogynistic barbarism was confined to the South, but these were modern practices, continuing well into the nineteen-eighties, and they were national. A 1973 study of Los Angeles County hospitals found that doctors were “cavalierly subjecting women, most of them poor and black, to surgical sterilization without either explaining the potential hazards or alternate methods of birth control.” Other women were threatened with the loss of their welfare benefits unless they submitted to state-sponsored sterilization. Before Harriet Washington was a scholar, she was a social worker in New York State. There she recalled coming across files that documented cases in which Black women who were discovered with an “unauthorized” man in their home were forced to choose between losing access to welfare benefits, including public housing, or submitting to sterilization. In 1983, Black women comprised only six per cent of the population, but they constituted forty-three per cent of women sterilized in federally funded family-planning programs. The uncertainty surrounding the use of the vaccine in Black communities is not quaint or antediluvian. Instead, it reflects a history of medical neglect and malpractice that continues to reverberate in contemporary health-care practices. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" The creation and dissemination of this vaccine is hardly routine, which has prompted questions from broad swaths of the public, not just African-Americans. The central role of the U.S. government has raised the most questions for everyone. The Trump Administration called the program to develop a vaccine Operation Warp Speed, and, indeed, at the end of the Presidential campaign, President Trump promised that the arrival of a covid-19 vaccine was pending. In the October Presidential debate, Trump insisted, “We have a vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks, and it’s going to be delivered.” Even after Trump’s election loss, his attempts to manipulate the vaccine delivery did not end. Just hours before the Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer vaccine, a Trump Administration official threatened to fire the head of the F.D.A. if the drug did not win approval by the end of the day. The questions that arise from the involvement of the federal government with medical care are augmented when they converge with people’s daily experience of government ineptitude and casual disregard for public health. Consider the debate over reopening the schools. Almost no one thinks that children being out of school is a good thing. Countless studies are being produced to show the impact that this disastrous year is having on poor and working-class Black children, in particular. But, as with the covid-19 vaccines, Black parents have been the most resistant to sending their children back to schools. A new study from the C.D.C. shows that, while sixty-two per cent of white parents surveyed this past summer thought that schools should reopen in the fall, only forty-six per cent of Black parents and fifty per cent of Latino parents agreed. Black parents are predictably chastised for not fully understanding the implications of continuing to rely on remote learning. Liberal critics have combined with school boards to describe school reopening as an “equity” issue, often targeting teachers’ unions that have also insisted on trying to stay out of schools that have not been properly retooled to increase ventilation or that lack the space capacity for social distancing. It is as if Black and Latino parents, whose communities have borne the devastating brunt of this disease, need to be lectured about what constitutes equity for themselves or their children. A staggering seventy-one per cent of African-Americans know someone who has been hospitalized with or died from the virus, compared to forty-nine per cent of white people. In fact, it is the absence of equity that has driven these families to want to keep their children at home. For all of the citation of studies and student outcomes in South Korea or the Netherlands, the return-to-school advocates seem to miss that Black parents simply do not trust that local officials and school administrators are telling the truth about the condition of the schools and the susceptibility of their children to the disease if they are in school buildings. Before the shutdown of schools due to the coronavirus, the Philadelphia School District was embroiled in a scandal surrounding the mishandled removal of asbestos in public schools around the city. Beginning in October, 2019, a thousand students were displaced from Ben Franklin High and Science Leadership Academy. For months, the school district had rushed the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Ben Franklin High in anticipation of relocating students from the magnet Science Leadership Academy. Nearly a month after school began, the discovery of mishandled asbestos resulted in the quick closure of both Ben Franklin and S.L.A. Students at Ben Franklin, which is almost ninety-seven-per-cent Black and brown, had been complaining throughout the previous year about the conditions in their school. But it was not until the arrival of students from S.L.A., which is thirty-eight-per-cent white, that the district became responsive to concerns about the condition of the building. The superintendent, William Hite, said that the district was “caught off guard” by the discovery of the asbestos, but, according to a Pulitzer-nominated investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer, careful asbestos removal has been a consistent problem in the Philadelphia public schools. The Inquirer reported about the conditions at Ben Franklin High, “The district and its outside environmental firms, for one, failed to provide a full picture of the asbestos hazards, as required by law. . . . The district ignored early warnings from contractors, alarmed by the extent of the asbestos, and pushed an untenable deadline to complete the work by the start of the 2019-20 school year.” Between December, 2019, and January, Alexander K. McClure Elementary School, in Northeast Philadelphia, was closed twice for asbestos removal. After the first closure, school officials pressured teachers and parents into returning to the school. A parent with children in another school complained that when she kept her children home, school officials threatened to charge her with promoting truancy. In early January, Philadelphia public-school officials pledged to keep Francis Hopkinson School open during repairs, saying that they had isolated the location of the disturbed asbestos. But when a teacher revealed that the school had replaced ceiling tiles the previous summer without adhering to asbestos-abatement protocols, officials conceded that they had to close the school until the asbestos was properly removed. McClure’s school nurse, Emily Seiter, captured the effect of the district’s actions. She said, “We had all these conversations with parents about whether or not the school was safe and I relayed the information provided by district officials. Now we know that we should not have trusted the school district and any trust that parents had in the district has been completely destroyed.” By the time of the covid-19 school shutdown, in March, seven public schools in Philadelphia had been closed because of the potential for asbestos poisoning. These skirmishes over public-school conditions exist in countless cities. Whether it is asbestos in Philadelphia, or lead paint in Baltimore and Chicago, or lead in public drinking water in Detroit, Portland, Oregon, or New York City, school officials and elected leaders’ inability to safely attend to such problems breeds mistrust and hostility. These are not simple issues. They involved funding streams that have, most recently, been undermined by the Trump Administration’s tactic of starving state and local governments to force people to return to normal life. But the intricacies of federalism and local funding matter little as an explanation for deplorable conditions in public schools. They matter even less when it is discovered that public leaders have not been forthcoming about these conditions, putting the lives of young Black and brown students at risk. The public hand-wringing about the fate of Black children during the pandemic seems false when those same hand-wringers appear indifferent to every other aspect of the children’s lives upended by the pandemic. This routine mistrust between poor and working-class families and public officials is the context within which we can understand the Black public’s reluctance to simply take the word of public officials that the vaccine is safe. The face of government in most ordinary African-Americans’ daily lives is one of deceit, intimidation, coercion, and sometimes death. From evictions, to predatory parking tickets and boots on their cars, to utility cutoffs, to potholes, to police brutality and abuse, to hospital closures, these episodes chart a lifelong course of indignity and disrespect. It has not led to African-Americans’ being anti-government zealots, as is often the case in white-grievance politics. Instead, African-Americans largely understand the state to be malleable through popular protest and the reach of electoral politics, knowing that it can bend toward responsiveness in ways that the private sector does not. This complicated relationship between African-Americans and the state can sometimes be confusing or unrecognizable to white liberals who think they know better. When their encounters with the state are largely unobjectionable—whether that means the police are responsive and nice to them, or their doctors do not collude with a public entity and remove their reproductive organs—a different relationship to the state exists. So, when public officials insist that schools are safe to return to—just as they did in early January with students at Francis Hopkinson—they have already lost the benefit of the doubt. It is easy for African-Americans to generalize about the ineptitude, callousness, and duplicity of officials, from those at the local schools to those in the federal government. And it is not unreasonable for Black communities to have questions about the vaccine or about the safety of the schools to which they send their children. It should be expected given the long history and contemporary expression of racism and inequality in this country. This doesn’t mean that African-Americans won’t take the vaccine or eventually feel comfortable returning their children to school, but both will require a credible public campaign and the implementation of safety measures that don’t dismiss the Black public’s concerns but, rather, seek to overcome them with trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability.

The Fight for Fifteen at an Orlando McDonald’s,26665,"Afew days after Mother’s Day in 2019, a McDonald’s in Orlando, Florida, found itself out of scrambled eggs and receipt paper, wiped clean from the holiday rush. Fortunately, a store on the other side of town was well stocked, and the general manager asked a shift manager to pick up the supplies. The shift manager declined, and so, when the general manager asked, did a second and third. But a fourth shift manager, Cristian Cardona, sighed and agreed to the errand, believing, wrongly, that he was obliged to perform such requests. While Cardona was driving back to his store, a truck drove into the passenger side of his car. He was not seriously injured, but his car was totalled. Cardona returned to work, handed off the cartons of scrambled eggs, loaded the receipt paper into the register, and finished his shift. That night, he filed an incident report, intending it as a request for compensation for the cost of his car. Months passed without any action from his employer. So Cardona took out a loan of fifteen thousand dollars and bought a new car. “Now I can’t leave McDonald’s,” he told me, during one of our first conversations, “because if I leave, I won’t have much to pay the debt I got into because of them.” (Cardona said that, about a year later, McDonald’s compensated him.) I met Cardona in March of 2020, by phone, while volunteering for the Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (ewoc), an effort to support non-unionized workers seeking to organize their workplaces in the face of covid-19-related threats to their safety. ewoc is spearheaded by the United Electrical Workers and the Democratic Socialists of America, and many of its organizers were active in Bernie Sanders’s Presidential campaign. As the campaign decelerated, those organizers sought to repurpose its infrastructure to support the key issues that had propelled Sanders’s run: workers’ rights and health-care protections. They roped together hundreds of volunteers, trained them to lead organizing conversations, and deployed them to connect with thousands of workers who had requested help organizing their workplaces for covid-19 protections. Cardona was one of the workers who wrote to ewoc; I was one of the volunteers who responded. Though Cardona had been interested in organizing for some time, covid-19 increased his sense of urgency. The McDonald’s at which he works is around the corner from a hospital, and is frequently filled with its staff and patients. Cardona and his colleagues were nervous; they now saw their customers as potential health threats. For the first month of the pandemic, few McDonald’s employees were given masks, provided with sufficient hand sanitizer or soap, or trained on social-distancing guidelines, according to a survey of more than eight hundred McDonald’s workers conducted by the Service Employees International Union. McDonald’s told me that it followed all C.D.C. guidelines from the beginning of the pandemic and that, like many companies, it at first struggled to procure masks because global supply was short. “Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve taken serious action to provide for crew safety and well-being in all restaurants,” a spokesperson said. But Cardona understood that he and his colleagues would have to protect themselves. He told me, “I wanted to organize because I felt like I had nothing left to lose.” Cardona, who is twenty-one, has been working at McDonald’s since 2017. He currently makes eleven dollars and thirty cents per hour. He lives with his parents and younger sister, in Orlando. His mother works as a cleaner for a bank. His father worked as a hotel-shuttle driver, but when the pandemic decimated tourist industries he lost his job; he has since found work doing construction and odd jobs. Cardona’s parents each make less than twelve dollars per hour. The family moved to Orlando from Colombia when Cardona was nine, to escape violence and gang activity. “We came here for the same reason a lot of people come here,” he told me. “Seeking something better.” But the American Dream hardly brought reprieve. Cardona wanted to attend college, but he couldn’t afford tuition, so he started working at McDonald’s after graduating high school. Today, many of his friends in Orlando stay in homeless camps and are food-insecure. “We have more houses than we have homeless people, but somehow we can’t give them homes,” Cardona said. “It just doesn’t have to be like that.” A patient kind of anger, well aimed but warm, uncoils in him when he talks about his observations of injustice. Cardona spends his spare time devouring history books and articles, finding voices on social media that connect the present moment to historical struggles for justice. “I like to follow people who tell their stories about organizing around them,” he told me. He also is an avid gardener. To his parents’ initial dismay, he converted the family’s small back yard into a garden plot, where okra and black-eyed peas erupt from a mountain of wood chips. He hopes to grow enough food one day to feed his family—and, eventually, his whole community. “The idea of liberating my people, my community, my family is my dream,” he told me. “I want to get a big plot of land. I want to grow everything I need—food, medicine, everything. I don’t want to earn a wage job where I’m working for a store owner, making him money, while I’m getting paid pennies on the dollar.” In November, more than six million Floridians approved a ballot initiative to raise the state’s minimum wage to fifteen dollars per hour by 2026. Though this increase will benefit Cardona and his family, it is hardly enough for him to get his own place or to make headway toward his dream of a community garden. He sees the minimum-wage increase as an important step forward, but too small and long overdue. “We won’t get fifteen for another five years. We need that now,” he said. “When this fight started, in 2012, they were asking for fifteen dollars an hour then. It’s no longer enough. By the time we get fifteen, it’s going to be even less.” Cardona is well liked and trusted by his co-workers. Some told me that he is one of a few crew members who can work any position at the restaurant well, from manning the grill to ringing up customers. After a year on the job, Cardona was promoted to swing manager, a ranking below general manager but above floor supervisor. Despite his promotion, he was troubled by his work environment, a story told by the burn scars on his arms, the heap he collapses into after his shift, the list of his co-workers who quit each week. “There’s very few people that are willing to put up with all that comes with working at McDonald’s. It’s pretty much the most desperate people,” he said. Mason Smoot, the chief restaurant officer of McDonald’s, said the company was “disappointed” to hear of Cardona’s experiences, which “are not reflective of the positive and safe work environment McDonald’s and franchisees foster for restaurant crew. This is not what we want for anyone in McDonald’s restaurants and [we] are investigating these matters further.” Cardona told me that he thinks he might have Stockholm syndrome because he hasn’t left yet. Then he thought a bit more and clarified why he has stayed: “I truly like a lot of the people I work with, and they all deserve better. Providing a quick service that feeds a thousand people a day is a valid job and essential, according to the state. No need to feel ashamed just because it’s McDonald’s.” He paused. “The people in charge are the ones that should feel ashamed. They take advantage of people in desperate situations.” Cardona, like millions of employees, is constrained by debt. His employer, like hundreds of corporations, has been liberated by it, thanks to fiscal policies of the past decade. After the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates as a recovery measure. Corporations, including McDonald’s, filled their shopping carts to the brim with debt. Between 2010 and 2019, S. & P. 500 companies nearly tripled their corporate debt, according to a Forbes investigation; during that time, the debt held by McDonald's increased from $9.1 billion to $33.1 billion. (McDonald’s disputed the accuracy of these figures but did not offer alternative numbers.) With the money tap running freely, McDonald’s filled its shareholders’ cups. Between 2014 and 2019, McDonald’s bought back thirty-five billion dollars of its own stock, driving up prices, while its shareholders raked in at least fifty billion dollars. (McDonald’s suspended share buybacks in March, 2020.) In the wake of the Great Recession, the company’s corporate structure proved capable of not merely surviving recessions but capitalizing on them. For McDonald’s employees, the global financial downturn brought renewed energy to struggles for workplace dignity. Invigorated by Occupy Wall Street, in 2011, and by mass protests in Wisconsin the same year, fast-food workers started organizing. Occupy Wall Street’s catchphrase, “We Are the 99%,” offered a pithy analysis of rising inequality, and fast-food workers added concrete demands: they wanted fifteen dollars per hour and a union. On November 29, 2012, an estimated two hundred fast-food workers in New York City walked off the job. Since then, fast-food workers across the nation have led walkouts, protests, and rallies, and their message has become a full-fledged movement: the Fight for Fifteen. This Tuesday, fast food workers in fifteen cities across the country will go on strike in conjunction with Black History Month to demand a fifteen-dollar-per-hour wage, as Congress considers including the measure as part of its covid-19 rescue plan. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures Already, at least nine states and several large cities have passed laws establishing a path to a fifteen-dollar-per-hour minimum wage. But the movement has always been about pressuring employers to treat their workers better; electing politicians to create wage laws was a secondary concern. As one of the world’s largest employers, McDonald’s has been a key target; changing practices there would set new standards not only for the fast-food industry but low-wage work as a whole. In 2019, the company agreed to stop lobbying against legislation to increase the minimum wage. But McDonald’s workers allege that it also responded to the movement with retaliation. Hundreds of workers reported having returned from Fight for Fifteen protests, actions, and meetings to find their hours reduced, their pay cut, their schedules changed; others found themselves demoted, some even discharged. Employees reported being harassed, spied on, and interrogated because of their activity with Fight for Fifteen—actions that would constitute violations of federal labor law. (McDonald’s said that it does not tolerate retaliation.) Between 2012 and 2014, McDonald’s workers filed two hundred and ninety-one charges of violations of employees’ rights with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that workers faced illegal employer retaliation for their workplace organizing. In response, McDonald’s claimed that franchises, rather than the corporation, were the responsible parties. In 2019, after years of legal delays, the Donald Trump appointees on the N.L.R.B. ruled in favor of the company’s claim that the vast majority of McDonald’s workers are not employed by McDonald’s. (The company said that the N.L.R.B. case does not allege that McDonald’s U.S.A., the corporate entity, acted in violation of labor laws, and that the settlement ended with all allegations fully remedied.) In 2018, Cardona said, Fight for Fifteen organizers came to his store and put posters about workers’ rights in the bathrooms; for a week afterward, he and other store managers had to report to top management every hour, confirming that organizers had not returned. Crew members were not allowed into the lobby on breaks, in case an organizer might approach them with a probing question, such as “How is work going?” “It was almost like we were on lockdown for a whole week,” Cardona told me. During that time, he reached out, via Twitter, to Orlando’s Fight for Fifteen organizers, offering to sneak them back into the store during his manager shifts. But he was unable to make contact, and at his store the issue of workers’ treatment and pay remained fallow for months. That is, until covid-19 arrived. In the spring of 2019, a few months before Cardona took out thousands of dollars in loans for a new car, the C.E.O. of McDonald’s bragged to the company’s shareholders about the year’s strong performance. “McDonald’s business continues to generate significant cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in the business for future growth,” the C.E.O. wrote in a letter to shareholders. Eleven months later, the pandemic threatened to puncture corporate borrowers’ soaring confidence. But no such perforation occurred. Instead, in late March, the Federal Reserve intervened in the corporate-debt market, taking a rare step of lending money to nonfinancial corporations, and, for the first time in its history, directly buying corporate debt. Suddenly, many corporations, regardless of their financial stability prior to covid-19, were given a lifeline. Thanks in large part to the Fed’s intervention, McDonald’s secured six and a half billion dollars in debt financing, more than six million from the Fed itself. As Americans watched their loved ones, housing, and paychecks slip away, McDonald’s found itself on startlingly solid ground. Meanwhile, Cardona knew that it was only a matter of time until someone at his store got sick. In mid-March, top McDonald’s executives got on a phone call with President Trump and other fast-food industry leaders—“all the big ones,” in Trump’s words. The leaders sought assurance that fast food would be designated as an essential service during coronavirus lockdowns, allowing their stores to stay open. The President, a known fast-food enthusiast, willingly agreed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin affirmed the industry’s necessity, as did an emergency physician at Northwell Health, New York State’s largest health-care provider and private employer, who told Business Insider, “Remember, we have thousands of healthcare workers who are working long shifts, aren’t going to have time to cook or prepare food and may be relying on restaurants to keep them going during this time.” Pieces of a new common sense were clicking into place: fast food is essential because it feeds the essential workers who are keeping the nation alive. But the essentialness of fast-food employees? On this, McDonald’s was more ambivalent. Five per cent of McDonald’s stores, including Cardona’s, are corporate and offer paid sick leave to their employees. At the other ninety-five per cent, sick leave is subject to local regulations or to the whims of their franchise employer. (The company said that many franchises offer paid sick leave, but gave no specific numbers.) Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which went into effect on April 1, 2020, franchises were required to provide paid sick leave to employees, but that requirement expired on December 31st. With all concerns—the flu, a stomach bug, even coronavirus exposure without a positive test result—most employees choose between coming to work sick or forgoing their pay. Between March 20th and March 31st last year, hundreds of McDonald’s and other fast-food employees led one-day strikes across the country—in Raleigh, Durham, Los Angeles, Tampa, St. Louis, Memphis— protesting a lack of gloves, masks, hazard pay, and sick leave. On April 1st, McDonald’s agreed to provide personal protective equipment, such as masks and hand sanitizer, to its employees. (The company said that it began taking action in March.) But, for many workers, the efforts were too late and not enough. Matters came to a head at Cardona’s store that month, when McDonald’s rolled out Thank You Meals. For two weeks, any health-care worker, firefighter, or cop with a craving for an Egg McMuffin or Chicken McNuggets could enter the drive-through for a meal on the house. Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald’s U.S.A., boasted of the company’s efforts to recognize the nation’s heroes. “I couldn’t be more proud of how our company, franchisees and supplier partners have come together to give back to those who are working tirelessly for our country,” he said in a statement. “That is truly our McDonald’s system at its best.” But, for Cardona and his co-workers, it was the McDonald’s system at its most McDonald’s: squeezing the most out of its employees while compensating them as little as possible and scripting them to smile. As soon as the Thank You Meals were announced, orders flooded Cardona’s store. The crew was insufficiently staffed. “In reality, we needed, like, five or six people,” Cardona told me. “We only had three.” The Thank You Meals had multiple components—a drink, fries, a note, a sandwich—making them time-consuming to assemble. An order with several Thank You Meals could take five minutes to put together—three minutes longer than it was supposed to. The crew was sweating to keep up. “When we’re understaffed, we’re doing multiple people’s job at the same time. But we’re not getting paid like three people’s paychecks,” Cardona said. (McDonald’s disputed this, saying that Cardona’s shifts were fully staffed at that time.) Temperatures surged, figuratively and literally. The store’s grills, toasters, and fryers were running at maximum capacity. Summer was rolling into Florida, and Cardona said the overworked A.C. would sometimes break down. (The company said there was no problem with the air-conditioning system.) A constant failure to keep up with orders “messes with your sanity,” Cardona said. “Like, how do you keep doing that for eight hours? Doing the job of multiple people, and not being on or fast enough for every order?” Customers, too, were at their limits—service was slow, orders not right. In response, management declared that future customer complaints would result in crew suspensions. Now, Cardona told me, “there’s also a fear that, if we’re not fast enough, customers are going to get angry and we’re going to get suspended. People depend on these paychecks. If they get suspended, they could lose their homes.” After one particularly gruelling shift during the Thank You Meals period, an employee of twenty-three years, whom I’ll call Charisse, wondered what she would feed her family that evening; food had been scarce the past few weeks. Cardona rang her up for a double fish filet—her employee meal for the shift—and a double Quarter Pounder for her son, but didn’t charge her for the second sandwich. McDonald’s was giving out hundreds of dollars of free food to other essential workers—would they really deny a $4.79 meal to one of their own? It turns out, yes. The next day, the general manager pulled Charisse and Cardona aside and told each of them that they could be fired for stealing food. She decided to grant them clemency, but, Cardona suspected, mostly to avoid having to let go of two of the shop’s best employees during such back-breaking days. A few weeks earlier, a new manager had left after his second day on the job. (McDonald’s called this account “inaccurate” and said that, at corporate stores, employees are entitled to free meals when they are working and half-price meals when they are not.) While McDonald’s gave away thousands of meals to recognize the lifesaving efforts of “frontline heroes,” its own employees were working twice as hard, in dangerous conditions, and felt they had minimal recognition or rewards. The nine managers at Cardona’s store got a one-time bonus; Cardona remembers receiving about a hundred dollars before taxes. (McDonald’s said that several crew members at the store were offered bonuses again in June.) The store’s general manager printed signs with pictures of Ronald McDonald and a message, in cursive font, that read “You are the McHappy to our customers. ‘We appreciate you!!’ ” and taped them around the store. At one point, the general manager ordered a stack of pizzas from Papa John’s for the crew. “I appreciate the thought, but that’s not going to pay our bills,” Cardona told me. “We could buy our own damn pizza if we got paid an extra dollar.” One of Cardona’s colleagues put it more bluntly: “If you’re gonna die, you’re gonna die. But, if you’re gonna live, you still gotta pay your rent.” In the United States today, there are workers and then there are workers. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the myth of the white male breadwinner loomed large as Donald Trump bellowed about his plan to save coal-mining jobs while offering neither rhetoric nor policy that would recognize the hardships of the more than eight hundred thousand people employed by McDonald’s in the United States. Essential care-giving labor—feeding, teaching, nursing, healing, minding, washing, soothing—has long been submerged in illusory notions of what work is and who does it. Although not one of us can survive a day without reaping the benefits of care work—the tending necessary to maintain life—actually doing this work for wages provides little to no formal economic benefit. The pay is low, the benefits meagre, and the social respect almost nonexistent. In an overworked society, fast food has become the national kitchen. On any given day, fast food feeds more than a third of the country. When working people are, almost by definition, short on time, quick access to cheap calories constitutes, in effect, a pay raise. During the Great Recession, as many cut back on full-service dining, fast-food consumption increased especially among working single parents. Today, fast-food sales are steadily rising, even as the pandemic has crumpled the restaurant industry at large. By the end of 2020, tens of thousands of restaurants in the U.S. had permanently closed, but McDonald’s boasted of its sixth consecutive year of sales growth. Yet fast-food workers—two-thirds of whom are women, and nearly half of whom are people of color—struggle to get by. A study by the University of California, Berkeley, from 2015, found that more than half of the 3.7 million people who work in fast food rely on public benefits to survive. Today McDonald’s is one of the five biggest employers whose full-time employees survive on food stamps and Medicaid programs. Work’s mythic foreground—its factories and firms—relies on its shrouded backdrop: a place to sleep, clean clothes, food to eat. That we both depend on care work and disavow its value creates a contradiction, what the feminist theorist Nancy Fraser calls a crisis of care. But a crisis is not the same thing as a disaster. A disaster, its etymology tells us, means a bad star, a fate which crashes into us, leaving craters of hopelessness behind. A crisis, in contrast, is a moment that demands judgment, a fork in the road that provokes difficult decisions. A disaster renders us helpless; a crisis empowers us with choices. An utter crisis, covid-19 has forced the world to reckon with the forces that sustain us, the essential labor that keeps us alive. But a crisis is merely the moment which demands hard choices; it does not guarantee that wise actions will follow. In the meantime, conditions remain poor. Last summer, McDonald’s workers across the country organized another round of strikes, in protest of their employer’s insufficient response to covid-19. When multiple workers in Oakland tested positive, thirty-three of the store’s employees went on strike for nearly three weeks, demonstrating against the owners’ failure to protect employees. Around that time, Cardona told me that four employees at his store had tested positive, though only one of the cases was disclosed to all employees. He said the store had never been closed for cleaning, though, once, a general manager strolled through the store with a spray bottle, wiping surfaces. (McDonald’s refuted this claim, saying the company’s protocols insured that, after a case was reported at the location, it was immediately closed for an overnight cleaning.) Cardona also recounted that one of his colleagues had come to work ill—vomiting, diarrhea. Cardona told him to go home and rest; his co-worker refused. “A lot of times, people chose their paycheck over their health,” Cardona said. “They don’t want to go homeless. They don’t want to go hungry. Maybe they have someone they need to take care of.” My organizing calls with Cardona—suspended across thousands of miles, rooted in different cities—are neither halting covid-19 nor raising workers’ pay. More often than not, I simply listen as he explains to me what it is like to get by as a low-ranking manager at a McDonald’s in Orlando, Florida, in the midst of a global pandemic. Once, early in our conversations, I asked him to tell me what he needs most from me. He laughed gently. “The feeling of having our voices and stories heard is already powerful for us,” he said. I frowned. Would not a concrete organizing plan or a corporate research campaign or connections with local organizers be more materially beneficial? It took me weeks to realize that Cardona wanted what his employer and his elected leaders had denied him: to be valued, considered irreplaceably precious. After all, he and his colleagues knew they were essential; it was the world who needed convincing. In a disaster, we demand heroes to protect us. But this is not a disaster. It is a crisis. Choices to value the labor we depend upon, not simply praise it, will secure our fate. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Protest Delivered the Nineteenth Amendment,7581,"For a country that prides itself on its democracy, the United States has forced a lot of its citizens to fight for the privilege of voting. August 18th marks the centenary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that the right to vote “shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” That milestone is sometimes described as having “given” women the right to vote. It wasn’t a gift; it was a hard-won victory on the part of suffragists who’d been agitating for it for more than seventy years, on the basis of their common humanity with men. Even in the decade before the amendment was passed, its ratification was by no means a certainty. Though women had the vote in a handful of Western states, elsewhere in the country state after state turned down women’s suffrage. The antis, who fretted that women would be irredeemably sullied by the rough-and-tumble of politics (and would push issues such as temperance and wage equality), included women as well as men. It took a surge of inventive, audacious, confrontational protests, inspired in part by militant British suffragists, to reënergize the movement. In January, 1917, the National Woman’s Party, led by the single-minded young suffragist Alice Paul, began a campaign of civil disobedience. For the first time, protesters picketed the White House. Woodrow Wilson, a Southern Democrat and patrician racist who had been reëlected President the previous year, had no interest in supporting a federal amendment granting women the vote, but tolerated the provocation for a while. After the United States entered the First World War, though, the suffragists started carrying signs comparing Wilson to the Kaiser, and his patience ran out. In June, the police began arresting the protesters en masse. Convicted of offenses such as “disorderly conduct” and “obstructing sidewalk traffic,” they were imprisoned, in harsh and filthy conditions, at the Occoquan Workhouse, in Lorton, Virginia. When the women were denied recognition as political prisoners, they went on hunger strike, and guards subjected them to horrific force-feedings. The more moderate suffragists continued to lobby male politicians, for the most part politely and effectively. But when Congress finally passed the Nineteenth Amendment, and the states ratified it, that victory was largely due to the new breed of suffragist who simply would not stand down. “People who had never before thought of suffrage for women had to think about it,” a jailed picketer recalled, “if only to the extent of objecting to the way in which we asked for it.” In the Presidential election of 1920, and for some years after, women did not vote in the expected large numbers. It was easy to blame them for a deficiency of civic spirit, and plenty of people did, including former suffragists. But there were structural forces at work. Local election officials often regarded the influx of new voters as a burden, and imposed poll taxes and literacy tests. Black women, in particular, faced obstacles that made voting risky and difficult, if not impossible. FEATURED VIDEO Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Responds to Verbal Abuse by Ted Yoho The disenfranchisement of Black women was a cause that Alice Paul and the newly formed League of Women Voters should have taken up—not least because African-Americans had been key figures in the drive for female suffrage, dating back to Frederick Douglass’s enthusiastic participation in the Seneca Falls Convention, in 1848, and Sojourner Truth’s “Ar’n’t I a Woman?” speech, three years later, up through the N.A.A.C.P.’s advocacy for the cause, starting in the nineteen-tens. Yet when Black women’s groups appealed to Paul for help, in 1921, she refused them, saying that the problem was a “race issue,” not a “women’s issue.” Some suffragists had hoped that women would consolidate into a coherent voting bloc, but this never happened. Women had their own crosscutting interests of class, race, and political and religious beliefs. They disagreed even on so-called women’s issues, such as abortion. But the past four years have been remarkably effective at turning women into a more united force. The historian Lara Putnam and the sociologist Theda Skocpol, who have studied the unprecedented mobilization of suburban college-educated women, most of them Democrats, since the Women’s March in 2017, call it a “national pattern of mutually energizing local engagement” that is shifting the political landscape. The gender gap that first appeared during Ronald Reagan’s Presidency has widened into a chasm since the election of Donald Trump: according to the Pew Research Center, fifty-six per cent of women now say that they are Democrats or lean that way, versus thirty-eight per cent who identify as or lean Republican. Black women, who tend to vote more reliably than other groups and who cast their ballots overwhelmingly for Democrats, played a crucial role in the 2018 midterms and in the 2020 Presidential primaries, especially in the South. Even among the white working-class voters who anchor Trump’s base, support for the President has fallen among women—from sixty-one per cent to fifty per cent, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. (His support among white men is as high as it was in 2016.) A year ago, the Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg conducted focus groups of working-class voters in Maine and Wisconsin. According to the Los Angeles Times, the resulting report concluded that women who had pulled away from Trump did so because“his ego makes him impulsive and a bully, healthcare remains unaffordable, he’s dividing the country, he doesn’t care about the working class, only the 1 percent, he’s corrupt and out for himself and he doesn’t respect women.” (And that was before his mishandling of the pandemic.) Voting out of office a President whom even former supporters describe that way—and who seeks to discourage voter turnout and crush protests aimed at advancing human rights—would be a better way to mark the struggle that women endured to win the franchise than any reverent commemoration. In a powerful speech on the House floor last week, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez denounced the language that she had been subjected to by a Republican colleague, Ted Yoho. He had called her, among other things, “disgusting” and “out of your freaking mind.” In some ways, the kind of verbal abuse she cited isn’t so different from the denigration heaped on women who protested for the vote. In 1918, the Times editorialized that women being jailed for “suffrage obsession” ought more properly to be put in the hands of psychiatrists. How grateful we are to those women and their obsession now. ♦ A previous version of this article misspelled the National Woman’s Party.

"In the Gendered Economy, Women Are Perpetual Debtors",10464,"Women make up nearly nine in ten nurses, more than eight in ten home health aides, and more than two-thirds of grocery-store cashiers. In other words, they perform the lion’s share of the vital care that we now call “essential” work. At the same time, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, women have been laid off at an outsized rate (a reflection of their concentration within the country’s lowest-compensated, least-secure jobs) and have been forced to reduce their paid hours to look after children at nearly twice the rate of their male partners. As the kinds of labor that sustain life have grown deadlier, women have taken on more of the risk. As paid work and the time to perform it become scarcer resources, men are retaining the better part of both. What conclusions can we draw from the gendered dimensions of the current crisis? Kate Manne’s “Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women” presents a paradigm that maps neatly onto life in lockdown. Manne, a professor of philosophy at Cornell, argues that women “are expected to give traditionally feminine goods”—including physical and emotional care—and “to refrain from taking traditionally masculine goods,” such as power and authority. These assumptions result in a society in which men “are tacitly deemed entitled” to much of what life has to offer, while women are perpetual debtors, their very humanity “owed to others.” Once again, Manne’s work is speaking to a moment that she could not have foreseen. Her first book, “Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny,” was released into the gathering storm of the #MeToo movement, in November, 2017. It was uncanny timing, and the intuitive explanatory power of Manne’s argument attracted a broad, enthusiastic following to a demanding academic work. Manne proposed that misogyny “should be understood as the ‘law enforcement’ branch of a patriarchal order,” a system of punishment that swings into action whenever women violate the rules. Sexism, by contrast, is the set of ideas that justifies the power which men hold. “Sexism wears a lab coat; misogyny goes on witch hunts,” Manne writes in “Down Girl.” “Sexism has a theory; misogyny wields a cudgel.” In “Entitled,” Manne turns her attention to the gendered economy that these forces defend. If sexism is a scientist and misogyny is a cop, then the system of entitlements is a suite of financiers forever seeking ways to profit off someone else’s debt. Manne applies her theory to a litany of lopsided situations, sorting them into one of three scenarios: first, how women can be punished for failing to provide sex, love, admiration, or anything else that the dominant sex considers its due (Manne points to mass murders perpetrated by incels, who kill in protest of perceived rejection); second, how women struggle to lay claim to masculine-coded powers and privileges, the Presidency being one prominent example; and, third, how women may be denied the feminine-coded forms of care—such as attention to their pain—that they are expected to supply, not demand. Manne first posited this slanted system of goods and services in “Down Girl,” and her arguments in “Entitled,” her first book for a general audience, may at times feel overly familiar to readers already acquainted with her work. In some cases, the new book remedies the other’s omissions, especially by considering transmisogyny and misogynoir, the interlocking systems of oppression that affect trans and Black women, respectively. Manne illustrates her ideas with recent headlines and cultural touchstones, travelling smoothly from the Brett Kavanaugh hearings to the sentencing of Brock Turner, from the movie “Gaslight” to the short story “Cat Person.” Manne examines these stories in order to reveal what male entitlement costs women and non-binary people, and how we might begin to resist its demands, even as the invisible matrix of male power shapes every imaginable interaction. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Our cultural scripts, Manne argues, award “outsize ethical importance” to men’s most passing desires; this helps to explain the pains that women take to avoid wounding men’s pride, whether by declining to speak up about topics they have expertise in or by consenting to sex because it seems rude to refuse. Sometimes, the system of entitlements is encoded in law, or reflected in its enforcement. Writing about the depressingly durable fact that only a tiny fraction of rape cases ever goes to trial—and that hundreds of thousands of rape kits sit untested in police labs all over the country—Manne argues “that we regard certain men as entitled to take sex from certain women.” She cites Kavanaugh and Donald Trump as evidence that “the most powerful of powerful men are deemed sexually entitled to ‘have’ virtually anyone, with minimal repercussion.” The least powerful women suffer a painful extension of this logic: “For girls and women who are marginalized in multiple ways—in being Black, trans, or disabled, among other possibilities—the proportion of men who may rape them with impunity tends to be so large as to render their rape kit not worth testing,” Manne writes. The ultimate male entitlement, Manne suggests—the one on which all the others rest—is the right to be right, both epistemically and morally. When a man views truth and authority as his property, a woman who contradicts him becomes a usurper. This explains why men who silence women—whether through Internet trolling or violent abuse—are liable to see themselves as their victims’ victims, and to feel justified in inflicting even deadly harm. (The mirror image of men’s self-pity is “himpathy,” a term that Manne first coined in “Down Girl” to describe the sympathy shown to boys and men who commit acts of misogyny.) Manne’s concept of entitlement is versatile and useful; like the theory of gravity, it has equal power in explaining phenomena both big and small. But if men are bloated Jupiters, drawing everything toward themselves, the question becomes how women can resist the pull. Manne’s answer is that we should be more entitled, when possible. “Entitlement is not a dirty word,” she writes. “Entitlements can be genuine, valid, justified.” This is far from a complete solution, as Manne acknowledges, partly because it’s frequently not “feasible or safe” for women and non-binary people to claim their due. What’s more, the women best positioned to act from a sense of entitlement are rarely those who suffer most from its lack. In a chapter about medical care, Manne describes how women in general, and Black women in particular, are often treated with skepticism in hospitals, their pain misdiagnosed as malingering or hysteria. This “testimonial quieting”—the philosopher Kristie Dotson’s term for cases in which “an audience fails to identify a speaker as a knower”—has no case-by-case remedy. Black women have little recourse when doctors refuse to judge them as authorities on their own bodies, or fail to see them as deserving of care. Ultimately, Manne writes, “Learning what one is entitled to is—or at least should be—inextricably connected with learning what one owes to others.” The most important entitlements can be claimed only collectively, by pressing for new laws and policies. In a review of “Down Girl,” in 2017, the writer Moira Weigel expressed a wish that Manne would engage with leftist-feminist thinking, which argues that the way to “change a society defined by ‘asymmetrical giving’ ” is “through such mechanisms as family leave, childcare, healthcare, care for the elderly, equal wages.” Society can refuse to provide essential services by compelling women to offer them free of charge. The pandemic has made this especially evident: in the absence of schools, women across the socioeconomic spectrum have sacrificed work to tend to homebound children. Businesswomen have turned down new clients, academics have stopped writing, and working-class women with no one to watch their kids often can’t leave home to work at all. Now that a disastrous summer has guaranteed continued school closures, wealthy families are hiring private tutors or signing up to pay twenty-five thousand dollars for “pod schools.” Only the most fortunate women have a hope of evading the crushing obligations that a society built on entitlements seeks to impose. Manne’s argument explains our predicament but offers little help in imagining a way out of it. Frustratingly, her consideration of caregiving is largely confined to professional women, whom she encourages to expect more of their shiftless co-parents. That suggestion feels far from adequate in a country that has abdicated the responsibility to care for its people. In a world in which women’s labor was not taken for granted, not only would husbands split the “second shift” with their wives but everyone would have access to decent health care, child care, and care for the elderly—and the workers who provide it would cease to be among the nation’s most underpaid. Those larger changes would require the creation of a political coalition that could bring together women with widely varying levels of what Manne calls “valid” entitlement. It would be interesting to see Manne make room in her analysis for the ways that women who already possess some power and privilege might begin to use it on others’ behalf.

The Loneliness of the Pro-Choice Republican Woman,19231,"Susan Cullman, a cigar heiress, philanthropist, and pro-choice activist, joined the Republican Party in the nineteen-seventies, when support for abortion rights was widely seen as consistent with conservative ideology. Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for President in 1964, was himself pro-choice, and his wife, Peggy, had helped to found an Arizona chapter of Planned Parenthood. “The conservative view at the time when Goldwater was around was that you don’t want the government in your life,” Cullman said. “The government isn’t supposed to enter your home, never mind your body.” In 1981, Cullman moved from New York City to Washington, D.C., as a consummate Republican insider: her former husband, Larry Kudlow, advised President Ronald Reagan on economic policy, and Cullman joined the President’s task force on private-sector initiatives. By that time, after a decade of courting Catholic voters and amid new efforts to sway evangelical Christians, the G.O.P. had become less hospitable to pro-choice views. Reagan and Bush had both turned against abortion rights, and the 1980 Republican Party platform supported a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade. “I would say, ‘Larry, I just got a thing in the mail from Planned Parenthood—I think I’m going to send some money,’ ” Cullman recalled. “And he would say, ‘Well, don’t tell anybody.’ ” (A spokesperson for Kudlow denied that these exchanges ever took place.) In 1991, Cullman, by then divorced from Kudlow (who is now director of the National Economic Council), joined a nascent advocacy organization and political-action committee founded by Mary Dent Crisp, the former co-chair of the R.N.C., called the National Republican Coalition for Choice. “I discovered that I joined an Administration that was starting to reduce women’s ability to manage their own life,” Cullman said. “So I was going to fight them, and I wanted to fight them on the inside.” The group, renamed the Republican Majority for Choice (R.M.C.) in the early two-thousands, shut down operations two years ago, but many former R.M.C. members remain close. It was these women, all of them white and well-connected, to whom Cullman turned on the evening of Friday, September 18th. She had just sat down to dinner with her stepson and his wife in her home in Stamford, Connecticut, when her stepson’s phone dinged. “Ginsburg died,” he said. “I felt horror in my bones, just horror,” Cullman said. She left the dinner table, turned on MSNBC, and started e-mailing her “old gang” from the R.M.C. These women had spent decades arguing to G.O.P. leadership that the Party’s increasingly narrow outlook on abortion, as reflected in its platform, candidates, and judges, did not reflect the views of a majority of Republican voters. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal feminist icon, would give President Trump his third Supreme Court appointment, cementing the rightward turn of the court for a generation or more, and placing the future of Roe v. Wade in doubt. The e-mail thread began in despair and moved to possible action. The group would need to convince a handful of Republican senators to delay a vote on Ginsburg’s replacement. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, the last two pro-choice Republicans remaining in the Senate, confirmed that weekend that they would not support a vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election. (Murkowski reversed her position on October 24th.) The group tried to think of other, relatively moderate Republicans who might be swayed to delay confirmation: Rob Portman, of Ohio; Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia; Mitt Romney, of Utah. But none of the women had any current connections to Portman or Capito. And, back in 2007, ahead of the Presidential primaries, the R.M.C. had run ads in Iowa and New Hampshire that called out Romney for his “flip-flops” on reproductive rights. “We realized,” Cullman said, “that we really didn’t have much of a leg to stand on.” The eventual nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is a devout Catholic; as a professor at Notre Dame Law School, she was a member of University Faculty for Life, and she once signed her name to an ad calling Roe v. Wade “barbaric.” Barrett was confirmed to the Supreme Court on October 26th, with Collins as the lone Senate Republican voting against her. At the end of 2016, the National Institute for Reproductive Health (N.I.R.H.) conducted focus groups in Ohio and North Carolina that tried to deduce if Trump’s electoral success in those states indicated an over-all drop-off in support for reproductive rights. “These voters thought, He says lots of things, but maybe he doesn’t believe them all,” Andrea Miller, the president of the N.I.R.H., told me. “They didn’t believe that this”—rolling back abortion rights—“was truly the agenda.” Historically, Miller said, “the Republican Party had the ability to have their cake and eat it, too—to speak to the base with a wedge issue and still maintain the support of white suburban women.” Decades ago, Republican lawmakers could claim credit for many advances in reproductive rights. In 1967, as governor of California, Ronald Reagan liberalized the state’s abortion law. Three years later, another Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller, signed a bill, co-authored by the Republican assemblywoman Constance Cook, that made New York the first state in the country to legalize abortion without a residency requirement. George H. W. Bush—a son of Prescott Bush, who was an early treasurer of Planned Parenthood—earned the nickname “Rubbers” for his support for contraceptive access. As a freshman member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bush co-sponsored legislation that created Title X, the domestic family-planning program that the Trump Administration is now dismantling. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Yet, in the late nineteen-sixties, Republican strategists were beginning to identify blue-collar social conservatives as an untapped voter base. These potential converts to the G.O.P. cause included Southern whites and Catholic Democrats—the latter mostly Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrants, who were historically bound to Democrats through urban machines. “Men showed a strong anti-Democrat trend between 1960 and 1968; women showed considerably less change,” the strategist Kevin Phillips wrote in the book “The Emerging Republican Majority,” from 1969. “The new popular majority is white and conservative.” Some of the Republican strategists of the time, such as Richard Viguerie and Paul Weyrich, were Catholic themselves, and sought to align themselves with an increasingly vocal Catholic leadership. Weyrich identified abortion as a key wedge issue, “perhaps the most effective” of all the single-issue groups, as Michele McKeegan, the former executive director of California’s Six Rivers Planned Parenthood, wrote in her book “Abortion Politics,” from 1992. Donald Devine, another strategist, suggested wrapping traditional Republican priorities, such as lower taxes and smaller government, in a blanket of opposition to abortion rights, sexual freedom, and women’s liberation. This approach, Devine argued, would heighten the Party’s appeal to a group of voters—twelve per cent of Americans, by his calculations—who didn’t vote Republican but held socially conservative values. Phyllis Schlafly, the telegenic conservative who helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, rallied women to the G.O.P. in the name of family values. By 1970, Republican registrars stood outside of Catholic churches across California, ready to enlist voters who were frustrated by the state Democratic Party’s support for legal abortion. Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, tightened this alliance. Toward the end of the seventies, evangelical Christian leaders—such as Jerry Falwell, of the Moral Majority; James Dobson, of Focus on the Family; and Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network—sensed an opportunity to align themselves with powerful political forces. The emerging Christian right’s enthusiasm for the issue, however, was not reflected among the rest of the Republican Party’s voting base. In 1972, a Gallup poll showed that sixty-eight per cent of Republicans believed that “the decision to have an abortion should be made solely by a woman and her physician.” These numbers remained steady, even rising at times, for the next two decades. Even today, although polling indicates that clear majorities of Republican voters oppose abortion access and support anti-abortion candidates, their stated views can shift significantly depending on how a question is posed. In May and June of this year, when the N.I.R.H. Action Fund polled voters in Arizona and Pennsylvania, sixty-one and sixty-five per cent of Republicans, respectively, agreed with the statement “I can hold my own moral views about abortion and still trust a woman to make this decision for herself.” Similar proportions of Republicans agreed that “these decisions are best left to women, their families, and their doctors/healthcare providers.” In the nineteen-nineties, the R.M.C. (then still the National Republican Coalition for Choice), had chapters in nearly twenty states, an annual budget of a million dollars, and eight people working in its D.C. office. Its political-action committee helped elect many pro-choice, moderate Republicans: Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Lincoln Chafee, of Rhode Island; Susan Molinari, of New York; Christine Todd Whitman, of New Jersey; Jodi Rell, of Connecticut; Bill Weld, of Massachusetts; and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, of Maine. But even candidates who shared the organization’s views felt increasingly compelled to hide them. “They would say, ‘I agree with you, but I gotta get elected first,’ ” Cullman said. Of the many Republican turnarounds on abortion, one of the most striking was Romney’s. In 2002, as a candidate for governor of Massachusetts, “he called me personally—he said, ‘I need your endorsement to win,’ ” Jennifer Stockman, the co-chair of the R.M.C. from 2000 to 2010, said. In his candidate questionnaire, Romney pledged to uphold abortion rights and support Medicaid funding to cover abortions for low-income women. “Within twenty-four hours, he sent it back, checked basically all the ‘Yes’ boxes, a hundred per cent pro-choice,” Stockman said. In 2005, as his Presidential ambitions crystallized, Romney executed a full reversal. As governor, he vetoed a bill requiring hospitals in Massachusetts to provide emergency contraception to rape victims, and used the occasion to publish an op-ed in the Boston Globe affirming his opposition to abortion. “I understand that my views on laws governing abortion set me in the minority in our Commonwealth. I am prolife,” he wrote. “I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother.” “We were so angry at what he did to reverse his opinion, just for political reasons, because he was running for President,” Stockman said. “Mitt Romney totally manipulated us.” (A spokesperson for Romney did not respond to a request for comment.) Like Cullman, Stockman was a Republican insider partly by marriage—her husband is David Stockman, a former Republican congressman for Michigan and President Reagan’s budget director from 1981 to 1985. “The problem with our side was two things,” Stockman said. “Our supporters would much rather play golf and tennis than go fill out mailers to get the vote out. And they were more interested in their pocketbooks than they were social issues. So they would vote Republican and say, ‘Oh, well, Roe v. Wade won’t be overturned—we’re not worried.’ ” Tanya Melich, who co-founded the New York State Republican Family Committee, in 1984, thought that the R.M.C. lacked the political chops to play hardball with abortion opponents. Melich had been a Republican since birth: her father was a Utah state senator, and in 1940, as a preschooler, she had handed out pamphlets for the Republican Presidential candidate Wendell Willkie. She later worked on the staff of Governor Rockefeller; her own pro-choice organization was backed by wealthy Manhattan women with last names like Du Pont, Gimbel, and Mosbacher. In Melich’s view, her national pro-choice counterparts had misplaced faith in George H. W. Bush, whom many of them knew personally. “The pro-choice Republican women supported the Republican establishment, and the establishment played them,” she said. “There was no fight.” Melich stormed out of the 1992 Republican National Convention in disgust, and, in 1996, published the book “The Republican War AgainstWomen.” In 2010, the Republican Majority for Choice merged with the wish List, a political-action committee aimed at electing pro-choice Republican women to office, but the organizations’ combined forces had little effect. There were few donors willing to write big checks to an increasingly steep uphill battle, and still fewer candidates who would run as pro-choice in what was becoming a monolithically pro-life party. “Looking back, we missed the state legislatures, the judicial appointments,” Cullman said. “We were focussed on national politics.” In the time Stockman had been involved with the R.M.C., at least a dozen former members of its board had quit the Republican Party altogether. “The whole thing was dwindling,” she said. “There was nobody there.” When the R.M.C. shut down, in 2018, Cullman and Susan Bevan, both national co-chairs, published an Op-Ed in the Times, titled “Why We Are Leaving the G.O.P.” “We don’t have the space to outline President Trump’s transgressions,” they wrote, “but it is important to understand that his rise is an inevitable result of the hostility to women within the Republican culture.” On reproductive rights alone, Trump has reinstated and expanded the global gag rule, which blocks funding for N.G.O.s that provide abortion services and counselling; blocked patients who use Title X funding from choosing Planned Parenthood clinics; and routed federal dollars toward religious groups that counsel against abortion. Bevan said that she will still vote for moderate Republicans in Connecticut, where she is based. In the 2016 election, she voted for Hillary Clinton after writing in Michael Bloomberg during previous cycles; this year, she said, she is “proudly supporting Biden.” Stockman told me that she occasionally writes in her husband’s name for President, voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, and voted for Biden. Melich registered as a Democrat in 2018. Cullman did the same last month, and plans to vote for Biden. Among the prominent Republican pro-choice activists of this era, the only one I could find who still strongly identifies with today’s Republican Party was Ann Stone, a communications consultant and direct-marketing entrepreneur. For sixteen years, Stone was the wife of the political consultant Roger Stone, the convicted felon and former adviser to President Trump. She launched the Republicans for Choice pac in 1990, inspired, she said, by the 1989 Supreme Court decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, which permitted Missouri to put restrictions on abortion care and unleashed a flood of state-level regulations across the country. In 1992, delegates gathered in Salt Lake City to debate the Republican Party platform, which included a declaration that “the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life” and supported “a human life amendment to the Constitution.” (This language remains largely intact in the current G.O.P. platform.) Ahead of the hearings, Stone bought up billboards along the route from the Salt Lake City airport to the convention center that read, “68% of the Party Can’t Be Wrong: Republicans for Choice.” Her P.R. flair was also evident at the hearings themselves, where she appeared on a panel on abortion issues. Stone defended abortion rights before the roomful of delegates, expressed her support for sex education and contraception access, and, most provocatively, dared pro-life Republicans to prove the strength of their convictions by becoming adoptive parents. “If you vote for the platform language as is, that would mandate more unwanted children be born, then, to show good faith, back up that commitment with action, and adopt,” Stone told her audience. “I have sample adoption papers here for each of you.” A woman then began distributing the applications to Stone’s fellow panelists, who included Phyllis Schlafly. “She about had a coronary during the hearing,” Stone recalled with a laugh. According to a 2010 Atlantic piece by Josh Israel and Aaron Mehta, between 1990 and 2010, Stone’s group raised some $5.5 million, but between 2000 and 2010 less than five per cent of spending went to political candidates, committees, or independent expenditures, and between 2005 and 2010 about half of one per cent went to federal or state campaigns. “Much of the group’s spending,” Israel and Mehta wrote, “has gone to the coffers of consulting companies owned by the PAC’s chair, Ann E. W. Stone,” with much of the balance covering Stone’s travel and entertainment expenses, car repairs, and parking tickets. (Stone told me that she spent heavily with her own companies because no other Republican-affiliated direct-mail firm would work with her.) In 2016, Stone helped launch a quixotic group called Women Vote Trump, and nowadays can often be found tweeting her support for the President using the hashtag #CrookedJoeBiden. She praised Trump for his “peacemaking efforts all over the world” and for securing the release of American hostages. I asked her what she thought of the President’s record on reproductive rights. “From a reproductive-choice standpoint, obviously I’m not happy,” Stone said. “The other stuff he’s doing—as a Republican, I’m thrilled.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Montana Voters Who Could Decide Control of the Senate,17762,"By E. Tammy Kim On the cool, drizzly last Saturday of September, Montana’s governor, Steve Bullock, spent yet another afternoon on the road, travelling from the capital, Helena, to the western part of the state for a string of appearances. A former state attorney general and onetime Presidential candidate, he is challenging the freshman Republican senator Steve Daines in a race that could very well flip the Senate in the Democrats’ favor. Bullock was trailing or leading in the polls by a point or two, depending on the week. As a sitting governor, his handling of the coronavirus pandemic has been on trial: his spring shutdown earned high praise, but case numbers have recently soared. To win, Bullock needs every vote he can get from Montana’s traditional Democratic coalition, which is composed of seniors and conservationists and, above all, Native Americans and union workers. Which is why, on that Saturday, he made sure to visit a union headquarters and a tribal reservation. In a small office in Kalispell, a northwestern town best known for its proximity to the sublime Glacier National Park, Bullock greeted a few of the seven hundred nurses who recently formed a union at Kalispell Regional Healthcare, a local hospital network. Purple stickers and “we support krh nurses” yard signs seemed to be everywhere, along with whiteboard flowcharts and children’s toys. Molly Moody, an organizer with the Service Employees International Union, gave Bullock a hug—they’d first met twenty years ago, when he was a labor lawyer. Bullock listened to the nurses describe their fight for a first contract, then made his way an hour south, to a coronavirus-safe, drive-in rally on the campus of Salish Kootenai College, on the Flathead Reservation. Under darkening clouds, a long line of mostly trucks and S.U.V.s turned past a highway billboard reading “please wear a mask / protect our elders” and into a giant parking lot. In Montana, as in the rest of the country, Native communities have suffered more sickness and death owing to covid-19 than their population numbers would predict. A prerecorded drum circle played over loudspeakers as a jumbotron projected the names and head shots of Democratic candidates for local, state, and federal office. One after another, eight politicians climbed a dais and unmasked at the mike. Bullock spoke last. “I’ve learned from you. I’ve grown with you. I’ve respected the government-to-government relationship,” he said, teeth chattering, to a barrage of supportive honks. “There’s a real choice here—Indian country should never be an afterthought.” Native Americans are the largest minority group in Montana and, from the perspective of the Democratic Party, as presumptively reliable a voting block as Latinos in the Southwest or Black voters in big cities and the South. In 2018, when Montana’s other Senate seat was on the ballot, Native voters, concentrated among late-count absentees, were widely credited with securing a third term for the Democrat Jon Tester. But they are not a monolith. Ian I. McRyhew, a Jicarilla Apache citizen and student at Salish Kootenai, told me at the rally, “I don’t identify as a Democrat or a Republican. Some of my views fall more into Libertarian.” In 2016, he voted for Donald Trump, he whispered—a fact he rarely discloses. But “I’m definitely voting for Bullock,” he said. This year, the Senate race in Montana, population one million, could be decided by a vanishingly thin margin. Bullock’s fate, and perhaps the nation’s, may rest on the ballots of around forty-five thousand voting-age Native Americans and forty-six thousand union workers, half of whom belong to the Montana Federation of Public Employees. Every election, in every state, invokes its own peculiar imagery and slogans and categorically “American” tests of authenticity. In Montana, candidates must wear the worn blues of old jeans, along with belt buckles, cowboy boots, and rugged fall jackets. They must pose in various outdoor settings, lift guns in the air, and speak of “access to public lands” in lieu of climate change. They must distance themselves from candidacy-killing concepts like a sales tax, friendliness with China, or a ban on the Keystone XL pipeline, while promising health care, jobs, and tribal sovereignty. Republicans like Daines, a wealthy businessman from Bozeman, hope to benefit from their association with President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, who won the state in 2016 by a margin of twenty per cent. Meanwhile, Democrats like Bullock avoid gratuitous references to “Chuck and Nancy”—Charles Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, and Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. Montanans pride themselves on voting independently. Since I moved here, in early August, for a journalism fellowship at the University of Montana, several people have used the same gesture by way of explanation. Holding an imaginary pencil, they start at the top of a ballot and move down in a series of left-right zigzags: Democrat, Republican, Democrat, Republican. The statewide and federal offices currently abide by this logic: a Democratic governor (Bullock), a Republican congressman (Greg Gianforte, famous for body-slamming a Guardian reporter), a Democratic senator (Tester), a Republican senator (Daines), a Republican secretary of state, and a Republican auditor. The question is: Will this purple pattern hold four years into the Trump era and in the thick of an ever-worsening pandemic? At the end of March, Bullock shut down the state, drawing national admiration and surprise, perhaps on the mistaken assumption that Montana is Tea Party red. But, after he eased restrictions, businesses reopened, summer vacationers arrived en masse, and schools and colleges resumed in-person teaching—and the number of new daily covid cases went from seven to seven hundred. In a debate between the Senate candidates hosted by Montana PBS, in late September, Daines criticized Bullock by pointing to “consecutive days of record positive covid numbers.” Montana now has one of the worst per-capita infection rates in the country. Yet only a small minority of Montanans I interviewed, Democrat and Republican alike, told me that they were dissatisfied with Bullock’s handling of the pandemic. A few people complained that Phase I had not lasted long enough. Several teachers said that the governor should have required masks in schools from the beginning of the summer, instead of adding that requirement much later. And some Native citizens regretted that the highways cutting through their land had not been closed to outside traffic. The Blackfeet Nation, for one, restricted access on the eastern side of Glacier National Park, even after the state began to move into Phase II. (About two-thirds of Montana’s indigenous people live on reservation land.) “I supported Bullock’s shutdown, also because tribes could then extend it,” Alissa Snow, a Blackfeet citizen and director of the Native vote program for the Montana Democrats, told me. The disproportionate impact of the pandemic makes Native outreach at once more necessary and more fraught. Snow is currently supervising twenty-four organizers across the state’s seven reservations, where sovereignty, reproductive rights, health care, language preservation, domestic abuse, and environmental policy are core issues. But, given the well-documented history of discrimination against indigenous voters in the U.S., she explained, “voting feels foreign. It’s new to Native people.” Jonathan Windy Boy, a longtime Democratic state legislator who supports charter schools and opposes abortion, represents a district that overlaps with two reservations. (Montana’s “citizen legislature” meets for just ninety days every other year; a record seven per cent of its current members are Native American, on par with the state’s general population.) Windy Boy, who is Chippewa Cree, believes that the Native vote could decide Bullock’s race. “Whoever’s going to win the U.S. Senate this round is going to be determined on the outcome of Indian country,” Windy Boy told me. “If you take out the map that Tester had, Tester won by a narrow margin, three per cent or two per cent, and had overwhelming support from Indian country in the state.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   Bullock has received endorsements from a handful of indigenous organizations, including the Fort Belknap Indian Community Council, the Chippewa Cree Tribal Business Committee of the Rocky Boy’s reservation, the Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board, and Montana Native Vote; Daines (and Trump) have received the blessing of one tribal chairman, on the Crow Reservation. Many indigenous voters I spoke with were critical of the G.O.P. for having sued Bullock and Montana to block mail-in voting, which forty-five of the state’s fifty-six counties voluntarily chose to implement. Nor was it lost on these voters that, in 2018, state Republicans successfully pushed a referendum prohibiting any individual from collecting and delivering more than six absentee ballots; the law was widely perceived as undermining minority-outreach efforts, because some tribal communities are nearly a hundred miles from the nearest county election office. But, in September, Montana Native Vote and the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana won a lawsuit striking down the ballot-collection law; a few days later, the state prevailed against the G.O.P. on the question of mail-in voting. Democrats felt buoyed by the verdicts. Though most state and local candidates are counting on the energy behind Bullock (and Joe Biden) to translate downward, the only Native politician running for statewide office told me that he could send energy up the ticket. Shane Morigeau, the Democratic candidate for state auditor and a member of the Salish and Kootenai tribes, hopes to be a draw for indigenous voters and thus “increase Indian-country turnout” for everyone in the Party. On a recent afternoon, surrounded by luminous red- and amber-tinted trees, I followed Morigeau; his wife, Jamie Iguchi; and his campaign staffer, Shibu Arens, to the members-only Deer Creek Shooting Center—four conspicuously nonwhite people in Missoula’s most conspicuously conservative gated compound. Next to the imposing front entrance, a big orange sign implored “ban bullock / save your guns.” Morigeau, who grew up hunting and fishing and owns twenty-two firearms, has identified, off and on, as an Independent. While in the state legislature, he sponsored bills that might be seen as “tough on crime” and at odds with the decarceral momentum among progressives. At the same time, he lobbied successfully for the state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act—which Daines opposes—and continues to advocate for behavioral and mental health. Morigeau often talks about his familial connection to these issues: he was raised poor, in the reservation town of Ronan. When he was in middle school, his sister committed suicide; he also learned that his grandmother was sexually abused at the Ursuline Academy, a local Catholic boarding school. If elected, Morigeau would oversee the insurance industry, allowing him to approximate certain provisions of the A.C.A. through regulation, even if the Supreme Court decides to repeal the law when it rules on it once again this term. A hundred and thirty thousand Montanans, more than a tenth of the population, rely on expanded Medicaid or the insurance exchange for health coverage. As of mid-October, a hundred and eighteen million dollars had been spent in the “battle of the Steves,” making it the most expensive race in Montana history. The Wesleyan Media Project found that there were more television ads related to Bullock or Daines than in any other Senate race in the country this year. Despite this lavish outlay, both candidates have presented themselves as friends of the working class, acknowledging Montana’s past and present as a relative bastion of unionism. Montana was where, after an organizer with the Wobblies (the Industrial Workers of the World) was lynched and a hundred and sixty-eight miners were killed by an explosion in Butte, in 1917, unions of every kind rose up against the Anaconda corporation’s “copper kings.” Today, Montana’s union members are more likely to wear scrubs or a school lanyard than a hard hat, but they have managed to resist the imposition of a private-sector right-to-work law, unlike their peers in every neighboring state: Idaho, Wyoming, and North and South Dakota. In the mining town of Butte, I met with Amanda Curtis, the most powerful union leader in Montana. (Some may also remember her as the whiskey-drinking radical in the Butte episode of Anthony Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown.”) Curtis is a career schoolteacher, longtime union activist, and former state legislator who, earlier this year, became the president of the twenty-three-thousand-member Montana Federation of Public Employees. Her ascent to the post as a young, progressive woman was a big deal in union and political circles: her predecessor, Eric Feaver, had been in the role for thirty-six years before retiring. Curtis now splits her time between the M.F.P.E. headquarters, in Helena, and the historic miner’s cottage that she shares with her husband, Kevin, a card-carrying Wobbly, and their seventeen-year-old dog. M.F.P.E., thanks to a funding boost from national affiliates, has recently invested more than six million dollars in political organizing and advertising, much of it focussed on the races for governor (to prevent a right-to-work law and safeguard Medicaid), schools superintendent (to fend off charter schools), and the U.S. Senate. The union has endorsed a long list of candidates for local, state, and federal office—mostly Democrats, but also twenty-six moderate Republicans. “In our regular meetings, I try hard not to sound like an offended liberal,” Curtis told me. “I don’t want to alienate people who have conservative leanings.” She supports Bullock for his policies, but has an additional, personal stake in defeating Daines: in 2014, when Daines first ran for the Senate, Curtis was his last-minute challenger; the Democrats recruited her when their initial candidate was forced to withdraw in a plagiarism scandal. Daines won handily, becoming the first Republican in a century to occupy the seat and helping Republicans retake control of the Senate. (Daines’s campaign did not respond to my e-mails and calls regarding his current race.) As part of M.F.P.E.’s effort to unseat Daines, Curtis hired a team of “member political organizers” to make calls, send texts, and knock on doors. A few weeks ago, I sat in on the group’s regular check-in meeting over Zoom. Most of the organizers were teachers, but there were also a few retirees and a prison guard. They were perhaps the Democrats’ best chance for focussed outreach—but all of them seemed to be maxed out. Peter Strand, a teacher in Bozeman, described seven-hour school-board meetings and colleagues who were scared to go to work because of the coronavirus. Erika McMillin, a school psychologist in Helena, cried as she gave her update: on top of the chaos of in-person teaching during the pandemic, a former student had recently died. And Bryan Blair, the prison guard, who lives and works in far-eastern Miles City, had been forced to quarantine, along with thirty other workers at the facility. Nine hours west, an M.F.P.E. member who teaches at Glacier High School, in Kalispell, offered a very different view of the election. Chris Adamcyk, a native of Long Island, calls himself a “reluctant union member” who is “socially liberal” and “fiscally conservative.” Adamcyk told me that he voted for Trump in 2016, but plans to vote “à la carte” this year: Biden for President and Daines for Senate. “I like Steve Bullock,” he said, but “I’m probably going to pull the lever on Daines, because I don’t know if Montana needs two Democratic senators. The weight right now, it’s precarious. I would like to see the G.O.P. be the majority.” Is Montana red or purple? Or merely populist? For white, working-class Montanans, the long shadow of the copper kings has engendered a general skepticism of power and outside influence. For those in Indian country, the history of attempted genocide and affronts to tribal sovereignty have produced apathy and a mistrust of electoral politics. Last I checked, the polls showed Bullock down by nine points one week, then up by two the next, back to a statistical tie. In order to prevail, beyond the margin of error, Bullock and every other Democrat in the state will need to persuade their traditional constituents not to follow Adamcyk’s lead. The stakes for Montanans are too high, they say, to zigzag a ballot out of stubborn independence. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Trump Administration’s Hateful Message on Health Care for Transgender Americans,7872,"On Friday, the Trump Administration released a set of guidelines dictating that discrimination against L.G.B.T. people in health care is not forbidden. It was the fourth anniversary of the Pulse massacre, when forty-nine people were murdered in a gay night club in Orlando, Florida. It was three months and one day since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. It was days, perhaps a week or two, before the Supreme Court is expected to release its ruling on whether discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The timing is conspicuous. The new document reverses a rule, put in place by the Obama Administration, in 2016, that banned health-care providers from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or whether a patient had sought an abortion. The Obama-era rule was immediately challenged in court and still hasn’t taken effect, so the new rule serves only to put an end to that particular legal battle—and to draw attention to the issue. The new document claims that the Department of Health and Human Services lacked the authority to try to implement the old rule in the first place. If the Supreme Court, in its forthcoming decision, rules that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, or both, constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex, which is banned by Title VII, then the three-hundred-page document published, on Friday, by Health and Human Services will be rendered legally irrelevant: the discrimination it encourages will be banned. That the Administration decided to speak now suggests that it was rushing to raise its voice in favor of discrimination before the Supreme Court either preëmpted or weakened the rhetorical impact of the rule. The H.H.S. document is a statement not of policy but of hatred. Its message is amplified by its appearance on the anniversary of the largest mass murder of queer people in U.S. history. This was the day the Administration chose to try to inhibit L.G.B.T. people’s access to health care—in the middle of a deadly pandemic. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? The document contains a long list of comments submitted by members of the public in response to the original draft of the rule, and detailed responses from H.H.S. One such response reads, in part, “A healthcare provider is not impermissibly stereotyping biological males (notwithstanding their internal sense of gender) on the basis of sex if it uses pronouns such as ‘him’; limits access to lactation rooms and gynecological practices to female users and patients; or lists a male’s sex as ‘male’ on medical forms. Similarly, a covered health care entity is not impermissibly stereotyping biological females (notwithstanding their internal sense of gender) on the basis of sex if it uses pronouns such as ‘her’; warns females that heart-attack symptoms are likely to be quite different than those a man may experience; advises women that certain medications tend to affect women differently than men; or lists a female’s sex as ‘female’ on medical forms. Finally, it is not stereotyping for covered entities to have bathrooms or changing rooms designated by reference to sex, or to group patients in shared hospital rooms by sex.” As innocuous as that quote might read to someone who has not spent time thinking about issues that transgender people face when seeking health care, it is certain to send shivers down the spine of any trans person, because it conjures a specific series of images: a transgender woman, in a doctor’s waiting room, being referred to as “he”; a trans man being refused access to a gynecologist’s office; transgender people receiving inappropriate medical advice and pharmacological guidance based solely on the sex indicated in their medical records, without regard for surgeries and hormonal treatments that change their physiology; and, of course, trans people unable to use the bathroom in a health-care facility. All of this, the document says, is all right—indeed, it seems to indicate that this is the desirable state of affairs. The H.H.S. rule cannot force doctors to start discriminating against trans patients; it can only broadcast the Administration’s attitudes. In fact, trans people as a group are at once unusually dependent on the health-care system—for many of us, trans care that may include hormonal treatments or surgeries is vital—and accustomed to facing casual, systematic discrimination. I have written about my own experience of landing in a New York City emergency room with a broken jaw and being compelled to take a pregnancy test in order to have a CT scan—despite being transgender, being on testosterone, having undergone a radical hysterectomy, and being past child-bearing age, but solely because my medical records indicated that I had been born female. As a well-insured privileged white person in New York City, I was able to win that fairly inconsequential battle (if I’d lost, I would have had to pee in a cup), but it was an example of the sort of obstacles health-care providers unthinkingly and automatically throw up in front of trans patients. For many people, the stakes are much higher than they were for me. On trans men’s online forums, I frequently read accounts of being unable to obtain gynecological care. Trans care is often illegally carved out of insurance coverage, forcing people to crowdfund their surgeries or buy hormones on the black market. Lack of access to trans care leads to another important health concern: the risk of suicide, which is far higher for trans people than it is for other Americans. In April, the Williams Institute, an L.G.B.T. policy think tank at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, released a report on vulnerabilities to covid-19 that are specific to transgender adults in the United States. The report estimates that nearly half a million people—a third of all adult transgender Americans—“feel concerned that if they express their gender identity, they could be denied good medical care.” Nearly as many reported that they had not gone to the doctor within the past year because they could not afford it. Trans people are more likely to be homeless, and L.G.B.T. people are more likely to be regular smokers than other Americans—two more factors that translate into a higher risk of dying from a coronavirus infection. The new H.H.S. rule may not have an immediate effect on trans people’s experience of health care, because legally, it changes nothing, but at this moment in time, it broadcasts a clear message from the Trump Administration to trans Americans. That message is that they want us dead. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Alexey Navalny Has the Proof of His Poisoning,25390,"Alexey Navalny is the biggest thorn in Vladimir Putin’s side. A decade ago, Navalny, as a young lawyer in Moscow, started piecing together publicly available information to document corruption and abuse of power in the Russian government. At first, he used his blog to document inflated prices in government contracts, suggesting kickbacks; he moved on to documenting real-estate holdings, luxury cars, and cash reserves that government officials had registered in the names of relatives. Navalny’s one-man project grew into the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a multimedia production company with dozens of investigators whose tools have ranged from data mining to sending drones to film the estates of highly placed bureaucrats. One of Navalny’s biggest hits is a series of films about the then Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s sneaker-collecting habits and estate, which included three helopads, a ski slope, cascading swimming pools, a hotel-style dormitory for staff, and a little lake house for ducks, which became an Internet meme. Russian authorities have been fighting to have the films removed from YouTube, where one of them has been viewed more than thirty-six million times. Navalny was one of the leaders of the mass protests against rigged elections that erupted in Russia in 2011 and 2012. Many of his fellow-members of the protest coördinating council are either living in exile, like the chess champion Garry Kasparov or the prisoners’-rights activist Olga Romanova, or dead, like the politician Boris Nemtsov. The Kremlin has tried to shut down Navalny and his organization through a series of court cases and arrests. But when Navalny was jailed in 2013, sentenced to five years on flagrantly trumped-up embezzlement charges, thousands of Muscovites protested and secured his release. When he was sentenced to house arrest, Navalny refused to comply, because the Russian penal code does not allow for such a punishment; after a few months, the authorities gave up, although his brother, Oleg, remained behind bars for years on spurious charges. Navalny’s activism and reach kept expanding—he even attempted to run for President—and for a few years he seemed invincible. (In a piece for this magazine in 2016, I wrote, “The strangest thing about Alexey Navalny is that he is walking around Moscow, still.”) But, on August 20th, Navalny fell ill when returning to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk. He was in a coma for twenty-six days, most of them in a hospital in Berlin. Analysis performed by multiple European labs shows that he was poisoned with a previously unknown version of Novichok, a deadly Russian-developed chemical agent. Navalny regained his ability to speak, write, and make jokes within ten days of coming out of the coma, but he has continued to experience significant physical effects owing to the poisoning. He spoke with me, over Zoom, from an apartment in Berlin, on October 8th; through the screen, it was obvious that Navalny had lost a great deal of weight, but otherwise he looked and sounded as I’d always remembered him. Our conversation has been translated from Russian and condensed. How did you know what had happened to you? This is the hardest part. The moment I knew that I’d been poisoned was the moment I realized my life was ending. What I was experiencing up until then was a kind of incomprehension. We can understand a heart attack or a stroke, but we cannot understand the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors—evolution does not prepare us for this. You are in this strange state of losing focus, and the strangeness keeps growing. I’ve compared it to being touched by a Dementor in a Harry Potter novel—you feel that life is leaving you. Let’s say I touch my own hand with my finger. My brain can perceive that signal and then cancel it out. But Novichok makes it not get cancelled out, so it feels like I’m touching my own hand a million times a second, and every cell in my body goes berserk, and the brain understands that this is the end. Let’s go back a second. You have boarded a plane from Tomsk to Moscow. You’ve opened up your laptop and started watching “Rick and Morty,” as is your habit. And then— I started losing focus. Say, right now, I see you on the screen. I understand that Kira is here in the room. [Kira Yarmysh, who is Navalny’s spokeswoman, was present during our interview; she was also seated next to him on the Tomsk-Moscow flight.] I understand this, but I cannot see it and focus on it. I have the strength to point at the screen. I see the cat who has entered the frame. But I can’t grasp the concept of “cat,” and if someone asked me to point at the cat on screen, I’d have a very hard time. On the airplane, I went to the bathroom and I realized that I would not be able to leave the bathroom on my own, and this was when I knew I’d been poisoned. It was so difficult to open the door. I could see the door, I could understand everything, and I was plenty physically strong enough—I would have been able to do pushups, if only, at that moment, I had been able to grasp the concept of pushups. I guess if I’d had sudden heart pain or abdominal pain, I would have realized even faster that I was dying, because this physical experience would have been familiar to me. But this was worse than pain. I’m trying to understand what you are describing, using my own experience. Have you ever been sedated with opiates? Sure, I had my appendix removed. And last month, too, I had the experience of coming out of sedation. This was nothing like it. Some people have compared it to a panic attack. But I think I understand what a panic attack feels like: a sense of growing anxiety. Anxiety is a feeling you can ultimately comprehend. I came out of the bathroom. I could still stand upright. I saw my seat and realized I would probably never make it that far. I thought I should probably ask for help, but I also thought that, by this point, it would be useless. So I informed the flight attendant that I was about to die, right there on their plane, and I lay down. On the floor. And then they tried to keep you awake, right? They were saying, “Sir, stay with us, please don’t lose consciousness. . . .” But I did. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Did you have a sense of the passage of time? I just felt indifference. It was clear that this was the end. I imagine that a person, when they are dying, thinks about important things, like, This is what I haven’t completed, or, What will happen to my children, or, What will my wife say? But I was finding it so difficult to think at all. So those awful screams that someone recorded— I don’t remember those. I might have been hallucinating. And the next thing you remember was nearly a month later? For a while, I was convinced that I was in the hospital and I’d lost my legs and was waiting for new legs to be made for me. And my wife, Yulia, and Leonid Volkov [Navalny’s closest associate in his political work] and the doctors kept telling me that I’d been in an accident and they’d make me new legs, and I shouldn’t worry. Obviously, there were no such conversations. Gradually, I started making contact with reality, in which there was Yulia and I waited for her to come every day and adjust my pillow. But I was still missing legs. And I had these awful hallucinations that really got to me, like I’m in a jail cell and the cops won’t let me sleep, and they keep asking me to recite the rules for being in jail, interspersed with lyrics by the [Russian rap group] Krovostok. Yulia and Volkov told me that there was a prolonged period when they would sit me up, and I would just stare, and they couldn’t tell whether I recognized them. As I recall, I was having mind-blowing conversations with them in my imagination. Yulia hung up a small flip chart and marked every day I spent in the hospital with a heart in magic marker. I reacted to that flip chart and looked at it, but I don’t remember any of that. I do remember the horrible feeling when you can’t speak or write. What do you mean? The doctor says, “Do you understand that you are Alexey Navalny?” I do. “Do you remember your age?” I do. “Do you understand that you are currently in Berlin?” I knew this, though I wasn’t particularly interested in why I was here. “Can you say a word?” I know I have a tongue, and I have lots of words floating around in my head. But that part of the brain where a word takes shape and you pronounce it—that wasn’t processing. I couldn’t say a word. This was torture. I probably looked like the cat in that scene in “Shrek,” with intelligent eyes but speechless. I can’t say anything and I can’t even get angry, because I can’t remember how emotions work, either. But this didn’t last long—about a week. I don’t remember this, either, but Yulia and Volkov have told me that when I did start talking, I addressed everyone in English. Then I discovered that I couldn’t write. They’d give me a piece of paper, and I realized that I couldn’t place letters in a line in the correct order. Say, “Masha.” I remember what the word looks like. I know that the first letter is “M,” followed by an “A.” I start writing—the first letter that comes out is “S.” Then I place the second letter below it—I’m writing in a column. I can see that this is totally wrong. I cross it out. I start over, and the same thing happens. This scared me, so I kept practicing, and I didn’t calm down until I was sure that I could put letters in a line and that I could write out the word I’m asked to write. I don’t remember being unable to read—they would sometimes turn on the TV to keep me entertained, and I understood the subtitles. What was the first word you tried to write? I wanted to ask for water, but I couldn’t come up with the word. I asked my doctor later—after all, many people have been in a coma—did they have the same experiences? He said that, first of all, my coma was unusually long. Also, it was overlaid with the poisoning by Novichok, and there is nothing to compare that to. They say the same thing about my rehabilitation: they can’t tell me anything, because, as far as we know, there are barely any known cases of people who survived Novichok. [They include the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were poisoned in England two years ago.] Plus, I was poisoned with a different kind of Novichok. Even the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons classifies its reports, because no one wants to publish the formula. This is a thing from hell. Chemical weapons are rightly banned. Conventional weapons can be used to kill people, but also to protect them; these substances are intended solely for making people die a painful death. How would you describe your condition now? I’m like a little old man. I was in the I.C.U. for twenty-six days, so I figured I’d be back to normal after twenty-six more. It hasn’t been that long yet, but I notice strange things. For example, I’ve lost all flexibility. I’m like the Tin Man from “The Wizard of Oz.” I’m doing a lot of physical therapy. My first physical-therapy sessions involved two glasses of water. I had to use a tablespoon to scoop up water from one glass and pour it into the other. It was so fucking difficult. It was unbearable torment. The first time they threw a ball at me, there was no way I could have caught it. I couldn’t walk across a room. My hands were shaking. In my mind, I felt like I did before, but then I’d try to get into a car with my hands and feet shaking. I can take long walks, up to three hours. I’m sitting as I talk to you, and it’s all right. It’s hard to concentrate for a long time, and it can get tiring to keep track of the questions and think about my answers. But that’s all right. Now, pulling a T-shirt off—that’s truly difficult. Strength is coming back faster than coördination and balance. I can now use the phone again, despite shaky hands. By the time you came to, all the information was there, right? The labs—one in Sweden and one in France—had already determined that it was Novichok. They’d done the testing while I was still in a coma, with Yulia’s permission. The only thing that’s happened since is the Russian authorities making crazy claims about me being a C.I.A. agent and all that. Who was the person who gave you the information that you had been poisoned with Novichok? Yulia. I had to be told multiple times; it took me a while to grasp. It still sounds bizarre. But the lab results—you can’t argue with those. Of course, this completely changes our understanding of how the Russian authorities work. We used to think we knew that Putin divides people up into different categories. There are the secret agents and former secret agents, and they can kill one another, poison one another, spray one another with polonium or Novichok, because they have their own rules. Then there are the politicians and other civilians. The instruments they use against politicians are arrests, fabricated criminal charges, defamation campaigns. But to kill so blatantly, using Novichok—that sends a very strong message. A mysterious death, especially of a relatively young person, scares people. Their plan was that no medical examiner, not even the most conscientious one, would be able to find traces of Novichok. There are, maybe, only seventeen laboratories in the world that can find it. You need a super-powerful mass spectrometer. They made sure to wait forty-eight hours [before Navalny was allowed to be evacuated to Germany], and after that, they were convinced that no one would be able to find anything on me. It would have been recorded as a suspicious death. That is a stunningly effective intimidation method: “He didn’t know his place, he exposed corrupt officials, he called Putin a thief—and what do you know, he is dead at forty-four. Could be his heart gave out. Could be something else.” You say that you thought they reserved poison for secret agents, but we know that Pyotr Verzilov, a Pussy Riot activist, was poisoned, and so was the journalist and activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was poisoned twice— That’s true. It was obvious to me that they were both poisoned. They were both very healthy, and Kara-Murza, like me, turned into an old man who had to use a cane. But still—and this is the tricky thing—even though I knew both of them, and I had no doubt that they were poisoned, there is always this little voice, this bit of doubt. Like, really, did they poison them? But why didn’t they die? Maybe they really did take too much medicine? My wife went through the same thing. On the one hand, it was obvious that I’d been poisoned. On the other hand, there were all these doctors, at the hospital in Omsk, wearing their white coats, saying, “Of course, he wasn’t poisoned, of course, it’s a case of pancreatitis.” It’s hard to argue with that. They are doctors! And we are not. And Yulia and Volkov both told me that even as they were making arrangements to have me airlifted to Germany, they were thinking, What if it is pancreatitis and tomorrow he comes to in Germany, furious? When Kira was with me in the ambulance, the medics told her I had clearly O.D.’d. “Tomorrow he’ll be walking around and talking,” they said. Novichok was apparently on something I touched. They say that if you inhale it, you die very quickly. If you ingest it with food, you are dead within an hour. If you touch it, it takes about three hours. But no one knows where it was. No one knows how this new version of Novichok acts. This scares people very effectively. You can decide not to fear being arrested or being shot. But when you are just walking around, and the next thing you know, your lifeless body is lying in the street, and a normal pathologist will never find anything? My case is unusual because, thanks to a series of happy accidents—the pilot who decided to make an emergency landing, the ambulance staff who acted on the assumption I’d overdosed and tried to revive me, and the fact that some traces of Novichok remained even after forty-eight hours—they actually found Novichok. We got evidence. And the thing about Novichok is you can’t just go and use it. If I give you some Novichok and tell you to go kill someone with it, you are going to kill yourself and the people around you and probably not the person you are targeting. You have to be trained to use it. This definitively changes our picture of what happens inside the Kremlin, and now we have proof. Every interviewer used to ask you, “Why haven’t you been killed yet?” So you have this understanding that you should have been killed by now, and you have people you know who nearly died from being poisoned, and yet somehow your mind tells you, This won’t happen to me, because—why? Because you think rationally. There are a million ways to isolate someone or kill them, but this is like some trashy thriller. I find myself living inside of a James Bond movie. If you told me that they planned to kill me using Novichok and administer it in such a way that I would die on an airplane, I would say that’s a crazy plan, because there are so many ways for it to fail. It’s like if someone asked me if I believe that I’m at risk for being beheaded with a lightsabre. I’d say no, even if I saw that someone I know is missing an arm and it looks to have been lasered off. Did you have any personal safety protocols? I know that when Garry Kasparov was still living in Russia, he never drank water except from his own supply, he didn’t eat in restaurants— I remember the first time he was in jail [sentenced to five days in 2007 for an unsanctioned protest] he didn’t eat a thing because he was afraid that they’d poison him. And we all laughed at him! We thought he was paranoid. He is the only person I know who took any security measures. But what can you do? The poison wasn’t in my food. A person can leave their apartment, open the car door, and be a goner—the door handle can serve as the contact surface. You can eat only the food you cooked yourself and drink only water you poured yourself, and still there is nothing that can keep you safe from surface contact. Let’s summarize what preceded this poisoning, just to make sure the reader understands how you were being silenced by a thousand cuts. Give me the highlights, perhaps starting with the first case against you and ending with all your bank accounts being frozen. Back in 2009 and 2010, my anti-corruption activities started getting people’s attention. I was filing court claims against giants like [the state-backed gas monopoly] Gazprom, and I even won a couple of times—the courts ordered them to release certain reports. In 2010, I was a World Fellow at Yale, and just when I was supposed to come back, there was a news item that I could be facing criminal charges. This was meant to keep me from coming back to Russia. I returned anyway, and they just started escalating, first by planting news stories about me, then there was the first trumped-up case against me [in 2011]. They made a mistake that I think they regret, when they let me run for mayor of Moscow. I would have won in the runoff if they hadn’t rigged the vote. So this was when they got scared enough to conjure another criminal prosecution against me, and that’s when they arrested my brother, taking him hostage. In the last two years, the pressure has really ramped up. Our offices have been raided by law enforcement repeatedly. There have been a number of criminal prosecutions. They tried to crush our nationwide structure, which they perceive as the biggest threat to their power. We are the victims of our own success. They saw that the organization can’t be beaten down, so they decided to seek a final solution. They imagined that if they removed me from the organization, the organization would break. They were wrong. The last two years is when you’ve promoted a strategy you call “intelligent voting.” Can you explain it? It’s tactical voting. It’s when we convince voters to back the No. 2 candidate—we may not like him, but he has a chance to knock out the representative of the ruling party. Usually all the candidates outside of United Russia get more than fifty per cent of the vote taken together, but it’s dispersed, so United Russia always wins. We used to think we’d never convince liberal voters to back a Communist, often even a Stalinist, or vice versa—convince Communists to back a liberal candidate—but we’ve succeeded in doing that to various extents in different places. Of course, Putin and the rest of them see this as a major threat. For Putin, United Russia is a foundational political structure. Yes, he controls the courts and dominates all the other parties, but in any autocratic regime, the ruling party is the key structure. This was true in the U.S.S.R. and East Germany, and is now true in Belarus, in Russia, and in Syria. There is always a ruling political party, and its ability to reliably take elections is what gives the regime its stability. Where has your approach worked? In Tomsk, United Russia no longer has a majority in the city legislature, for the first time in twenty years. In Moscow, we didn’t manage to do that, but we got a bunch of very active people into the city legislature. Same in Novosibirsk. All these years you’ve been fighting corruption. Do you think this is Putin’s most important quality—that he is corrupt? He is obsessed with power as a way of amassing wealth. He is obsessed with money. He is personally involved in apportioning money—he decides how much he gets, how much each of his people get. Gradually, of course, power became more important. Now he is, without a doubt, the most powerful man on the planet, because nothing keeps him in check. Sure, the U.S. President leads a stronger country, but he is constrained by the courts, by Congress, by the media, by the opposing party. Putin leads a country that’s not particularly strong, but there are no constraints on him at all. He could be using this power in different ways, but to him it’s just a giant money pump. He wants more: more palaces, more money, more billions. So I have been fighting corruption, because corruption is the political foundation of this regime. So you think that “Putin is corrupt” is a more important or precise statement than “Putin is a murderer”? Yes. Because he murders in order to be able to perpetuate the corruption. He is different from someone like Lukashenka, for example—Lukashenka is very corrupt as well, but he doesn’t have this bottomless thirst for goatskin sofas, gold handguns, and giant palaces. What are the palaces for? Putin can’t live in them while he is President, and he won’t be able to live with them if he ever stops being President, because if he ever loses power, he’ll end up in prison or in exile. Why do people collect stamps or baseball cards? They die, and their descendants sell them off. Why do you accumulate as much gold as you can in a computer game? That’s how people work—they always want more. And he wants to take all the money in part so that other people don’t have it and can’t influence him. I understand you are going back to Russia after you recover? Of course I’m going back. If I don’t, that will be the ideal outcome for them. They’d love to have me as just another political émigré. You have given one interview so far to a Russian journalist, the very popular YouTube talk show host Yury Dud. I found it hard to watch, because he says you are wrong to think that you were poisoned and accuses you of having delusions of grandeur. And this is a journalist who supports you politically! Yet he refuses to believe that it’s all so simple, so crude, and so cruel. What was that like for you? I don’t mind. The news sounds so crazy that it’s hard to believe. I can afford to be O.K. with it, because the facts speak for themselves. It’s not me people are arguing with but chemistry and independent labs. Anyway, my entire political life consists of having arguments with people who believe in nothing or believe in conspiracies, or who are just dumb. So having to argue my case is nothing new. I like doing it. I’m not going to be able to persuade everyone, but I will persuade some people, simply because I stand on the facts and the truth.

“Equipo Trump”: The President’s Brazen Attempt to Win Over Latino Voters,12897,"On June 23rd, Donald Trump visited Arizona to celebrate the completion of two hundred miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That the number of coronavirus cases in the state had reached an all-time high did not stop Trump from focussing on the structure, hailing it as “great,” “powerful,” and “really foolproof.” His visit to Arizona, a key battleground state in the 2020 election, gave him an opportunity to showcase a formidable campaign promise that he has neither fulfilled nor got Mexico to pay for. Before surveying the thirty-foot-tall fence in San Luis, where a silver plaque awaited his signature, Trump spoke at a border-security roundtable. He boasted of his success in preventing immigrants, drugs, crimes, and even the coronavirus from reaching the U.S.’s southern border. For that, Trump had an unlikely ally to thank. “I want to thank the President of Mexico,” he said. “He’s really a great guy. I think he’ll be coming into Washington pretty soon.” Two weeks later, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador boarded a commercial flight en route to the U.S. capital. His decision to visit Trump in the midst of a pandemic and a fraught American election spurred criticism on both sides of the border. Many argued that Trump could reap political benefits from the meeting at a time when he is hoping to pull Latino voters away from Joe Biden, especially in battleground states he must win in 2020, such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. While Trump’s polling averages have plummeted among other groups, his support among Latinos has remained steady. He is still losing among these voters by a wide margin—more than thirty percentage points—but he also appears to be benefitting from Biden’s inability to generate enthusiasm for his candidacy in the community. Recent polls show that less than sixty per cent of the Latino electorate would vote for Biden—a far lower number than the seventy-one per cent who voted for Obama in 2012 and the sixty-six per cent who voted for Clinton in 2016. During two tightly scripted public appearances, where no questions from the press were permitted, López Obrador flaunted his friendship with Trump, showering him with adulation and praising his treatment of Mexico. “I’m here to express to the people of the United States that their President has behaved toward us with kindness and respect. He has treated us as we are: a dignified country,” López Obrador, who is commonly known by his initials, amlo, said. He left Washington politically unscathed at home because Trump, in a rare display of discipline, made no virulent remarks against Mexico. “Mexican-Americans uplift our communities,” Trump declared. “They strengthen our churches and enrich every feature of national life. They are hardworking, incredible people.” In Trumpian fashion, the President took full political advantage of the visit. Hours after the two leaders spoke in the Rose Garden, Trump tweeted a campaign-style video of López Obrador hailing him and his record. Snippets from Trump’s remarks, mixed with triumphant music, narrated the footage. “Today we celebrate the historic victory we achieved together just days ago, when nafta was officially terminated and replaced with a brand-new, beautiful U.S.M.C.A.,” Trump says as a picture of the trade deal, featuring his signature in oversized letters, appears on the screen. Earlier in the day, when Biden reminded his followers on Twitter that “Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists,” the proxy account @EquipoTrump responded that “Trump has actually delivered for our community. That’s why President López Obrador said today that @realDonaldTrump has treated Mexicans with ‘understanding’ and ‘respect.’ ” Days later, Axios reported that the Trump campaign planned to spend millions on Spanish-language ads featuring López Obrador’s remarks at the White House. Equipo Trump is the official bilingual Twitter account of the President’s reëlection campaign. In recent days, the account tweeted a warning in Spanish that a possible Joe Biden Vice-Presidential pick, Karen Bass, would adopt policies of appeasement toward the Venezuelan ruler, Nicolás Maduro, and Cuba’s leader, Raúl Castro. It also wished Peruvians a happy Independence Day. Unlike in 2016, the Trump campaign appears to be actively trying to expand Trump’s base of support among Latinos. The effort is being shepherded by Vice-President Mike Pence’s nephew, John Pence, a corporate lawyer in his thirties who has said that he discovered the perils of socialism while studying abroad in Argentina and teaching English in Nicaragua. It has a Latino advisory board comprising twenty-two members, ranging from Hispanic business leaders to evangelical pastors. And, since the onset of the pandemic, the campaign has been holding frequent online events and sending out e-mails highlighting issues that appeal to conservative Hispanics, warning of “The Radical Left’s” desire to achieve “unlimited abortions through Biden” or its attempt to “cancel Goya Foods.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Still, the campaign, in many respects, is closely following Trump’s aggressive 2016 playbook. Last fall, when Biden launched an initiative called Todos con Biden (All with Biden), Trump’s team rushed to buy the Web domain. To date, anyone visiting the site todosconbiden.com will find a photograph of the Vice-President looking downward, with his arms crossed, and an announcement, in both English and Spanish: “Oops, Joe forgot about Latinos.” A link at the bottom of the page, which reads “Vamos” (“Let’s Go”), redirects visitors to the Latinos for Trump Web page. “We’ve seen that the Trump campaign has no compunction when it comes to weaponizing any statements of support for their own political purposes,” Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist and pollster, told me. “If the campaign thinks it’s enough to propel them to be able to win the Hispanic vote on the basis of amlo’s comments, they’re sorely mistaken. If their aim is to try to use these comments to increase support from Hispanic voters on the margins, it might very well have that effect.” Trump, though, also faces enormous political challenges in increasing his support among Latinos. His stance on immigration, and particularly his Administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their families, is widely unpopular in the community. As the pandemic continues, Trump’s claims of a thriving economy, which once resonated strongly among Latino men, are no longer credible—the unemployment rate for Hispanics currently stands at more than sixteen per cent. Furthermore, Latinos have caught and died from the coronavirus at an outsized rate—the research group Latino Decisions recently reported that, in a majority of states, Hispanics are more than twice as likely as other Americans to contract the virus. All the while, the President has continued his long-running practice of making false claims about undocumented immigrants and playing on racial fears as a way to scare voters into supporting him. On June 28th, he tweeted, “Corrupt Joe Biden has confirmed that he ‘would give UNLIMITED Healthcare to Illegal Immigrants’. This would break our system and bring millions of people to the USA.” To Trump’s opponents, this all begs the question of why López Obrador would allow himself to be so overtly used. After the Rose Garden address, Representative Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and the son of a Mexican immigrant, derided López Obrador as “nothing more than Trump’s collaborator.” In 2018, López Obrador ran for office on a pledge to counter Trump’s vitriol and restore the dignity of Mexico. The previous year, within months of Trump’s inauguration, he had filed a complaint at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in Washington, D.C., denouncing the Administration’s border wall and its immigration policy. He also published a book, “Oye, Trump” (“Listen Up, Trump”), in which he declared that “Trump and his advisers speak of Mexicans the way Hitler and the Nazis referred to the Jews, just before undertaking the infamous persecution and the abominable extermination.” “López Obrador at some point decided, or was convinced, that bending the knee was a better option than standing his ground with Trump,” Arturo Sarukhán, who served as Mexico’s Ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013, told me. In Sarukhán’s view, the visit was “a slap in the face to migrants in the U.S.—eleven million of whom are Mexicans—and a boon to Trump’s dog-whistle xenophobia and chauvinism.” There’s a clear answer, though, as to why López Obrador made the trip. He is under enormous pressure to revive the Mexican economy, which was stagnant even before covid-19 arrived—its prospects now are even bleaker. The Bank of Mexico recently announced that the country’s G.D.P. would fall between five and nine per cent this year, and as many as 1.4 million jobs could be lost. “The U.S. remains Mexico’s largest trading partner, so you cannot underplay the fact that there is an element of economic pragmatism,” Daniel Erikson, a former adviser on Latin America to Vice-President Biden, told me. “The question is, Will it be worth it? And at what cost?” By focussing almost exclusively on trade and seeking to appease Trump on immigration, López Obrador has glossed over thorny issues such as the flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico and the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. Instead, López Obrador has reduced the bilateral agenda to the topics that best fit Trump’s agenda. He is among the few Latin American leaders, including the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, who have praised Trump’s Presidency. However humiliating López Obrador’s acquiescence to Trump may appear to be, it has had few negative repercussions for him at home so far. Most of López Obrador’s supporters in Mexico, where the President maintains the unwavering support of his base, view his handling of Trump favorably. “One would think that Trump would be more unpopular in Mexico than in other countries, because we’ve actually borne the brunt of many of his policies,” Denise Dresser, a political scientist at itam, a university in Mexico City, told me. “But López Obrador has reframed collaboration with Trump vis-à-vis his base as something to applaud, and confrontation as something to decry. So this may be a political win for López Obrador, at least in the short term.” In the long term, however, there are no guarantees that Trump will refrain from scapegoating Mexico or its people, particularly if he wins reëlection. The day after López Obrador’s return to Mexico, Trump was back on the campaign trail. In Florida, he stopped by the U.S. Southern Command headquarters for a briefing on the unit’s counter-narcotics operations. During the visit, he suggested that Mexico was a potentially dangerous source of the coronavirus. Epidemiologists have found that travellers from Europe were the primary source of the virus in the U.S. “We’re up to two hundred and fifty miles,” Trump said, in reference to his wall. “And especially with covid—that turned out to be very lucky for us that we had the wall, or we would have been inundated, because they do have some big problems.” Trump’s comments echoed the false, racially charged claims that he had made as a candidate in 2015: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” In a subsequent interview with Chris Wallace, on Fox News, Trump claimed that the media was not paying enough attention to the coronavirus outbreaks in Mexico and other countries. “Why don’t they talk about Mexico? Which is not helping us,” Trump said, even though the country has recorded a quarter of the U.S.’s number of cases per capita. “All I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn’t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

How Private-Equity Firms Squeeze Hospital Patients for Profits,18204,"In the late twenty-tens, local news outlets around the country began reporting on cases of surprise medical billing: patients who had been treated in hospitals that accepted their health insurance later received much larger bills than they were expecting. In one extreme instance, a forty-four-year-old schoolteacher in Austin, Texas, was admitted to a hospital after a heart attack, assured his insurance was accepted, and then received a hospital bill for $108,951. When patients complained, they were told that one or more of the doctors who had treated them at the hospital—an anesthesiologist, say, or a radiologist—was not actually in their insurance company’s network. In emergency situations, in which a patient was rushed to the E.R. by ambulance, there was no opportunity to disclose this or get consent. But some patients said that, even in cases of elective surgery, they weren’t given an opportunity to find a doctor who was covered by their health plan. The frequency and severity of the practice seemed to be increasing. Outrage over surprise billing transcended partisan lines. A poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated that more than seventy-five per cent of the public wanted the government to do something to prevent it. Congress members starting hearing complaints from their constituents. In early May, 2019, even President Trump expressed a desire to address the practice, saying during a speech, “We are determined to end surprise medical billing.” That July, Democrats and Republicans in the House Energy and Commerce Committee introduced a bill, called the No Surprises Act, that would require medical providers to give patients twenty-four hours’ notice if they were going to be treated by a medical provider who was outside their insurance network, and would create a benchmark to restrict how far above the median price out-of-network providers could charge. In June, senators had introduced a similar bill, called the Lower Health Care Costs Act, which included an arbitration provision that would help manage disputes over how much out-of-network providers would be permitted to charge. One of the bill’s sponsors, Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, had been contacted by a father in Knoxville who had taken his son to an emergency room after a bicycle accident; the father paid a hundred-and-fifty-dollar co-pay but later received a bill for eighteen hundred dollars from the doctor, who was out of network. The legislation seemed sure to pass. But, soon after the Senate version was introduced, a barrage of television ads criticizing the bills appeared across the country. The ads were slickly produced and ominous-sounding; they described the bills as “government rate-setting” that was likely to shutter hospitals and endanger lives. In one, a pair of emergency responders rush a bloody sixteen-year-old strapped to a gurney through the doors of a hospital, only to find that it has closed. Some highlighted the profits that insurance companies made in 2018—in the billions of dollars—and suggested that these companies were responsible for the surprise bills, and that they should be the ones to face increased regulation. At the same time, mailers were sent to people’s homes, and hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of ads appeared on Facebook. The ads all urged people to tell their representatives in Congress to vote against the bills. The campaign was paid for by an organization called Doctor Patient Unity, which was classified as a dark-money group and did not disclose its staff or where it got its money. Eileen Appelbaum, an economist, had been following the saga, and thought she knew who might be behind the ads. Appelbaum has hazel eyes and speaks with passion about the intricacies of financial engineering. She taught for many years at Rutgers University and is now the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington, D.C., economic-policy think tank. Much of her research has focussed on the ways that private-equity firms—investment funds that purchase companies and try to increase their profitability—reshape the businesses that they buy. Appelbaum and her frequent collaborator, Rosemary Batt, a management and labor-relations expert at Cornell University, were in the midst of a research project looking at the role of private equity in health care. They knew that two of the largest private-equity firms, Blackstone and K.K.R., owned Envision Healthcare and TeamHealth, large physician groups that staff hospitals around the country with doctors; they found that bills from doctors within those groups were responsible for much of the sudden increase in surprise medical bills. (A spokesperson from TeamHealth said that the company does not send out-of-network charges directly to patients, but litigates them with insurance companies. A spokesperson from Envision Healthcare declined to comment.) “We already knew a lot about P.E. buying up doctors’ practices,” Appelbaum told me recently. “Now surprise medical bills were out of sight. That’s their business model.” Appelbaum suspected that the P.E. companies were behind the practice, as well as behind the ad campaign to stop the legislation. Appelbaum grew up in Philadelphia, where her father ran an appliance store. Neither of her parents had gone to college; Appelbaum earned a master’s in mathematics and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her research centered on the relationship between workers and a company’s management. When Appelbaum started out, the prevailing view was that companies could make themselves more productive by investing in their workers. In the nineteen-nineties, she and Batt undertook a study and found that, for example, giving workers more decision-making authority over how work got done led to increased company profits. The book that they produced from this research, “The New American Workplace,” was published in 1993. But in the years after, the thinking in the business world shifted. A newly dominant business philosophy, called “shareholder value theory,” held that companies exist primarily to deliver profits to their shareholders, and that managers should increase revenue and cut costs, with little regard for the long-term effects. Appelbaum and Batt saw this playing out in the real world. In many cases, companies were sending work to other countries where labor costs were lower. In others, they were practicing “domestic outsourcing”: subcontracting out parts of their businesses to other U.S.-based companies, to run their accounting departments, corporate cafeterias, or janitorial services, among others, rather than employing those workers directly. “They moved away from the idea of, How do we make our current workforce more productive? and to, How do we move workers off our payroll and onto a contract company? And then they can do whatever they want with the workers,” Appelbaum said. “And, if you’re a contract company, how do you get the contract? By being the lowest bidder. You’re at rock bottom, offering just barely enough to attract any workers at all.” Appelbaum and Batt found that the pressure for these practices seemed to be coming from Wall Street analysts and shareholders. “People had a very old view of what the corporation was, as a kind of stand-alone, publicly traded entity, free to make decisions on its own,” Batt told me. “We understood globalization, deregulation, and labor markets, but we didn’t understand capital markets. There was this big hole in the academic research.” The 2008 financial crisis made the issue seem even more pressing, and they decided to focus their research on private-equity funds. “You needed to look at the most extreme example if you wanted to understand the idea,” she said. They endeavored to write a book about private equity aimed at people who dealt with labor issues, including union leaders, who often didn’t realize that, when they were negotiating with corporations over contracts and working conditions, the managers of private-equity firms were actually pulling the strings. Private-equity funds typically try to sell the companies they take over in three to five years, either to the public, through an initial public offering, or to another company. Their task, then, is to make their portfolio companies more attractive to other buyers in a relatively short time; ideally, this is accomplished by making improvements to the business, such as by bringing in talented managers and making the company more innovative and efficient. But, in 2009, there was relatively little known about how the process actually worked. “It was very hard for us to get access to private-equity firms,” Batt told me. “We didn’t have too many interviews. We did a lot of reading.” They interviewed who they could, and studied documents and legal filings. The more they dug in, the less straightforward the industry appeared to be; sometimes, private-equity funds seemed to make money even when a company they had taken overstruggled or went bankrupt. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Appelbaum and Batt found that private-equity firms often engaged in financial maneuvers that brought them profits but weakened their target companies. Firms usually borrowed heavily to finance takeovers; the new debt was put on the books of whatever company was being purchased, and that company was responsible for making the interest payments. The firms sometimes used a strategy called “dividend recapitalization,” in which the target company borrows even more money and uses it to pay “dividends” to the private-equity owners. The target company was also often made to pay fees to its private-equity owners for consulting and other services. These strategies meant that the investors made returns right away, but they increased the debt load on companies that were often already heavily in debt. In 2005, for example, Toys R Us was taken over by K.K.R., Bain Capital, and Vornado Realty Trust, which put five billion dollars of debt on the company’s books to finance the takeover. In 2017, the company posted eleven billion dollars in sales, but much of that had to go toward interest payments on loans. In September of that year, Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy, went into liquidation, closed hundreds of stores, and laid off thirty-three thousand workers. Appelbaum and Batt tried to acknowledge when they felt that private equity played a positive role—for example, when P.E. firms took over small companies that didn’t have access to more traditional business loans and helped them grow. Over all, though, they concluded that the firms encouraged short-term thinking that damaged industries. They found that the method that the firms used to report their returns also made them sound better than they actually were. The firms then used the inflated projections to pitch themselves to pension funds, which invest money for workers. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters all ended up providing capital to funds that were implementing layoffs or sending jobs overseas. During the final push to complete the book, Batt was diagnosed with lymphoma, a form of cancer, and didn’t know whether she would survive. She spent five months in the hospital, on a feeding tube, and then spent several more months recovering at home, working on the book. “It kind of kept me alive, thinking, Oh, my God, we’ve got to get this book done,” Batt told me. The final study, “Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street,” was published in May, 2014. Gerald Epstein, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, wrote that, in it, Appelbaum and Batt “pull back the curtain on the shadowy world of private equity and its role in the management and mismanagement of our economy.” In 2018, Appelbaum and Batt started working on a report for the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a think tank, about private-equity firms buying companies in the health-care industry. “It’s been an ongoing interest of ours because we felt that it was the worst sector private equity could be involved in,” Batt said. The stakes were higher than in toy retailing: health care was a complex and heavily regulated industry, and drastic cost reductions had the potential to affect people’s safety. When they looked into it, they found that the patchwork structure of the health-care industry had created an opportunity for P.E. firms. Physician-staffing companies could choose to opt out of contracts with insurance companies, even if the hospitals where their doctors worked did have contracts with those companies. This left the staffing companies free to send much higher bills to patients treated there; the patients were captive customers, with no opportunity to shop around for doctors with more reasonable fees. (The same thing was happening with air-ambulance transportation companies, which had been bought up by P.E. firms.) “We think of it as a market failure,” a spokesperson for Senator Alexander told me. “This is something that happens when patients don’t have much choice between providers, whether in an emergency procedure or an elective procedure.” In 2019, as debate about surprise billing started to filter into the news, and the bills were being formulated in Congress, Appelbaum wrote a short piece, for The Hill, called “Private Equity Is a Driving Force Behind Devious Surprise Billing.” In it, she was one of a handful of people to publicly make the connection between EmCare (a division of Envision Healthcare) and TeamHealth and their Wall Street owners. Soon afterward, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation gave Appelbaum and Batt a grant so that they could further publicize their research on the subject. In September, they published a longer article in American Prospect, which showed more definitively that the firms were behind the surprise billing practices and speculated that they were also leading the attempt to derail the legislation. A few days later, the Times published an investigation into the dark-money lobbying campaign, confirming that Envision Healthcare and TeamHealth were funding “Doctor Patient Unity.” “They had spent nearly thirty million dollars on ads,” Appelbaum said. “We fought them almost to a draw with our seventy-five thousand.” Last December, the Senate and House committees combined their bills into one version that everyone could agree on; they intended to try to pass it that month. Then, about a week before the vote on the end-of-year spending bill, to which lawmakers hoped to add the combined bill, members of the House Ways and Means Committee suddenly introduced their own version of a bill, which effectively halted the process and forced everyone to go back to the beginning to try to reconcile the bills. Appelbaum and Batt questioned the motives of the new legislation, given that it came so late in the process; they noted that the congressman Richard Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts and the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, reported twenty-nine thousand dollars in donations from Blackstone during the three months before his committee introduced the new bill. “Its purpose was to put a monkey wrench in the works, which it did,” Appelbaum told me. (A spokesperson from Neal’s office said that the Congressman had been working for a year to find the best way to address surprise medical billing, and that “his campaign donations do not affect his policymaking on any issues.”) The spokesperson for Senator Alexander said, “The dark-money groups and the lobbying blitz on this issue, to us, proves how lucrative the exploitation of this problem can be.” (Greg Blair, a representative of Doctor Patient Unity, argued that the legislation would create a “financial windfall for the insurance industry” at the expense of doctors and hospitals.) Right now, the legislation is frozen as Congress focusses on addressing the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. When I contacted Appelbaum recently, she said that the pandemic had made the issue of surprise billing even more important. Congress recently passed a bill called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free testing for covid-19 but not free treatment. Symptoms of the disease can come on quickly, sending patients to the E.R. without much warning. These, Appelbaum warned, are precisely the conditions under which surprise medical billing happens most frequently. And, with so many people flooding hospitals, it seemed only a matter of time before billing horror stories began to appear. (In March, Envision Healthcare, one of the physician groups, pledged that it would not send surprise bills pertaining to screening and treatment for covid-19, although such promises are not binding.) Appelbaum urged the government to address the practice quickly. “As sick people come to hospital E.R.s, and as they are admitted to hospitals, we can expect the number of people getting surprise medical bills to explode,” she said. “Our representatives in Congress really need to get their act together.” A previous version of this piece incorrectly described a congressional voting procedure.

Immigrant Doctors Want to Help Fight COVID-19 but Are Stymied by State Licensing Laws,12426,"On the evening of April 3rd, the mobile phones of many New Yorkers began beeping with a push alert from City Hall. “Attention all health care workers: New York City is seeking licensed healthcare workers to support healthcare facilities in need,” the message read, with a link to sign up. Even before the coronavirus crisis, there was a shortage of doctors around the country; since the pandemic hit, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have been urging retired doctors and nurses to help their colleagues on the front lines against covid-19. (In early April, de Blasio told NPR that the city would need forty-five thousand more “clinical personnel” by the end of the month.) The alert made its way to the cell phone of Aleksandra Prasolova, who was sheltering in her apartment in South Brooklyn, working on a jigsaw puzzle to help pass the time. Prasolova, who is thirty-seven and moved to New York three years ago, is an anesthesiologist and intensive-care physician with nine years’ experience in Moscow hospitals. In 2009, when the swine-flu epidemic reached Russia, she was working in the intensive-care unit at an underfunded city hospital. “We couldn’t do a CT scan or MRI. We had nothing—we had to work like in the nineteenth century,” she told me. “Some days, we had to wash out our gloves because we didn’t have any others, and we just used them again.” Prasolova registered online, but she knew it was unlikely that she’d be called, because she doesn’t have a medical license in New York State. She looked into getting one when she first arrived in the U.S., but the process in New York—each state sets its own requirements—involves passing the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination, which is expensive to prepare for and take, and also requires the completion of a hospital residency of at least three years (four years, for anesthesiologists), which is difficult for a foreign-trained specialist to obtain. So Prasolova worked at a local clinic, digitizing medical files, and taught anatomy and physiology part time at a small private medical school. In responding to the alert, she hoped to be able to volunteer in some other medical capacity. On April 9th, the H.R. office of a hospital in Queens promised to e-mail her forms meant to establish her qualifications. She’s still waiting for them. “I’ve been checking my spam constantly,” she told me. “I want to be useful somewhere, do something.” According to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., there are two hundred and sixty-three thousand immigrants in the United States with degrees in health-related fields who are either working in low-paying jobs or are out of work. Many live in states that have been hit hard by the pandemic, such as New York and Florida. “Florida is the state with the highest number of college-educated migrants, but many are, for example, unemployed Cuban health professionals who can’t convert their degrees,” Jeanne Batalova, a sociologist and a senior policy analyst at the Institute, told me. Many work “as cashiers, child-care workers, or taxi and Uber drivers.” In recent weeks, the governors of New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and a few other states have issued executive orders to relax the rules and issue temporary licenses, in certain cases. Governor Phil Murphy, of New Jersey, has issued the most flexible order to date, allowing temporary medical licenses to physicians who have practiced in other countries within the past five years and have at least five years’ work experience over all in hospitals or clinics. The physicians do not have to have taken the U.S.M.L.E. Prasolova easily fulfills these requirements. But, in New York, Cuomo has taken a more limited approach: the state still requires passing the exams, though it has reduced the residency requirement to just one year. Two weeks ago, in Massachusetts, Governor Baker issued an executive order that reduced his state’s residency requirement to two years. But, Eva Millona, the executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, told CommonWealth Magazine, “Sadly, many foreign-trained doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals in Massachusetts don’t fit that profile.” The process became more difficult in 1976, when Congress passed a law claiming that foreign-trained medical workers were not as professionally competent as U.S. graduates, and that there was “no longer an insufficient number of physicians and surgeons in the United States such that there is no further need for affording preference to alien” doctors. Since then, a few states have passed small amendments to the law, but the path to licensing remains challenging for most. Cindy Huang, the vice-president of strategic outreach at Refugees International, who advocates for refugee doctors, told me that, even though the states control the process, “the federal government still could put together a task force to develop guidelines.” President Trump’s anti-immigrant stance, however—on Tuesday, he announced a sixty-day suspension of new green cards—would likely stand in the way of such an initiative. As the Times reported earlier this month, the White House has been making it difficult for four thousand foreign physicians to get visas to start residencies for which they have already been approved. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Gregory Maniatis, the director of the International Migration Initiative at the Open Society Foundations, has been discussing with organizations and officials in countries around the world ways to unlock their countries’ credentialling processes. “There are all these people who can contribute, who want to contribute, and we are stopping them from doing that,” he told me. “Any person who is not overtly anti-immigrant,” he added, would say, “of course we should be doing that.” The Open Society, with More in Common and YouGov, conducted a survey asking Americans if they would approve of foreign doctors working on the front lines of the pandemic. Seventy-five per cent said yes. José Ramón Fernández-Peña was a primary-care physician in Mexico before coming to the United States in the nineteen-eighties, when the aids crisis was at its peak. He earned a master’s degree in public administration, with a concentration in health policy, at New York University, then worked in administration at Bellevue Hospital. Along the way, he met many foreign-trained doctors who wanted to get back into the field. So, in 1999, when he started teaching in the health-education department of San Francisco State University, he founded the Welcome Back Initiative, which helps immigrant health professionals pursue the credentials they need and find education and job opportunities. It now has offices across the country. “From New York to Washington State, folks are coming into our offices asking, ‘Is there any way I can help?’ ” he said. Fernández-Peña explained why the licensing process is so challenging. The U.S.M.L.E. exams are intended for recent medical-school graduates, whereas foreign-trained physicians may have been working in specialized fields for years. “Imagine a cardiologist,” he said, “who has been training abroad for years on heart problems, if he would be able to recall the names of bones in each foot, after many years out of school.” In addition, the fee to take the exams, plus the cost of textbooks and other expenses, can amount to ten thousand dollars, which many immigrant doctors may not be able to afford, especially if they have families to support. “The immigrant that left Iraq probably didn’t walk out with a hundred thousand dollars in his pocket,” Fernández-Peña said. He’s aware that some professionals who have been out of training might be too rusty to take on the pandemic’s most complicated patients. “I was a doctor in Mexico thirty-five years ago, so maybe don’t give me a license,” he said. “But I can take people’s temperatures, I can be in the testing sites, and I could do all that in Spanish,” he added, pointing out that Latinos are one of the groups on which the coronavirus is taking a disproportionate toll. “All the immigrant workforce could work in many roles during this crisis.” Then there is the residency challenge. “There are high standards everywhere,” Fernández-Peña said. “But some countries have managed to make the process simpler, such as Australia, where you have to pass some exams and then you work with the supervision of a doctor for just one year.” In 2016, there were twenty-six thousand residencies available across the U.S., and thirty-five thousand applications. That year, Kristina Sokolovska Konieczny, a thirty-seven-year-old primary-care physician from Macedonia, applied for almost two hundred residency spots and was not accepted to any. Each year, the number of medical-school graduates increases, but the number of available residency positions does not. That’s because, in 1997, Congress capped the number of residents for which teaching hospitals could receive Medicare funds. A bill currently before the House, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, would, by 2025, increase the number of Medicare-funded residency slots by fifteen thousand. Konieczny, however, decided not to wait; she is now working as a nurse in Massachusetts. Nursing is another profession suffering from a shortage of personnel. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are openings for more than two hundred thousand nursing positions a year; in 2018, only a hundred and seventy thousand were licensed. Some immigrant advocates are concerned that the state-level executive orders are, in effect, asking immigrant medical workers to put their lives at risk without guaranteeing them a future after the pandemic passes. “I would hope somebody keeps track of these contributions, and values them,” Fernández-Peña said. “That doctors and directors will say, ‘I strongly recommend this person’ in their applications after the crisis, because their work should be honored.” Maniatis, of the Open Society Foundations, agrees, saying, “It’s our job to make sure that the temporary becomes permanent. Maybe we can look back and say, ‘Look, this byzantine process of certification . . . turned out to be a real Achilles’ heel during the pandemic.’ Maybe we should reconsider it.” Lubab al-Quraishi, a forty-seven-year-old surgical pathologist from Iraq, who worked for several years at the Baghdad Medical City Hospital and the Oncology Teaching Hospital, is also hoping to contribute. She came to the U.S. in 2014 as a refugee and the mother of two young children. She couldn’t afford to take the licensing exams, so she worked as a cashier before finally finding a job as a pathologist’s assistant in New Jersey, a position that paid just above minimum wage. “I feel sad,” she told me, “because here we are—we have been here all the time, and nobody paid attention to us before this crisis started.” She filed an online application to get one of New Jersey’s new temporary licences, and, while she waited to hear back, she volunteered at a drive-through testing facility. On Tuesday, the New Jersey division of Consumer Affairs approved her licence, for six months, with a possible extension if the public-health emergency continues. She is now waiting to hear from a hospital. “This country gave me a second opportunity,” she said. “So, for me, this is my chance to say thank you.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Two Hundred Thousand Americans Are Dead,22363,"At some point in 1993, the two-hundred-thousandth American died of aids. By that time, a decade had passed since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first described the emergence of a mysterious new syndrome. Freddie Mercury and Arthur Ashe had died of the virus, and Magic Johnson had announced his retirement from the N.B.A. Tom Hanks was soon to win an Oscar for his role as an H.I.V.-positive gay man, in “Philadelphia.” Still, the tragic milestone passed without much notice. H.I.V. had become the leading cause of death among young American men, but researchers and activists were still fighting to raise awareness about the virus, and acceptance for the people who were suffering from it. Two years earlier, the hundred-thousandth American had died of aids. That death was announced in a short article on page eighteen of the Times, which dispassionately reviewed statistics and projections. The novel coronavirus is about to claim its two-hundred-thousandth American life. (It may already have done so; statistics lag.) Less than eight months have passed since the start of the pandemic. There hasn’t been time to make a movie about it, and there’s been no need to raise awareness; the toll of the virus is tracked daily, even hourly, across the country and across the world. But that doesn’t make the extraordinary loss of life any easier to fathom. In less than a year, covid-19 has killed four times as many Americans as died from the opioid crisis during its deadliest year. It has killed more Americans than those who perished in every armed conflict combined since the Second World War. Globally, it has killed nearly a million people. Reckoning with such a number, we might try to imagine the dead as individuals. Though the virus is worse for those who are older, people of all ages have died, and of all races, backgrounds, trades, and political persuasions. Each life lost was embedded in a web of relations. According to one estimate, each person who dies of covid-19 leaves behind an average of nine surviving family members. If this is right, then there are now at least 1.8 million Americans mourning the loss of kin—parents, husbands, wives, children, siblings, grandparents—and millions more who are mourning with them. Meanwhile, as a doctor, when I think of two hundred thousand lost lives, I think of the ones I wasn’t able to save while caring for patients in the early days of the outbreak in New York. I think of the couples transferred hand in hand to the hospice unit; of a parent comforting young children through FaceTime; of an elderly man worrying about using a ventilator that might be needed by someone younger. Moments of national tragedy are usually met with elevating Presidential rhetoric. The country looks to its leaders to offer hope and give meaning to its collective suffering. Three days after the September 11th attacks, in a speech at Ground Zero, George W. Bush told the nation, “I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” Later, at a prayer service, Bush said that “grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. But goodness, remembrance, and love have no end.” After President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson called on the country to “put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence”; he urged Americans to turn away from “the apostles of bitterness and bigotry.” No such messages will be coming from this President. Donald Trump has abdicated both managerial and moral leadership. (“I don’t take responsibility at all,” he has said, and, “It is what it is.”) Instead of helping the nation heal, he uses his bully pulpit to sow confusion, division, and distrust. He freely admits to misleading the public about the lethality of the virus; he disrupts the efforts of public-health agencies, tarring them with his own brand of partisanship and misinformation; he argues that talk of the virus is designed to damage his reëlection prospects. Meanwhile, his surrogates describe the pandemic, which sickens or kills thousands more Americans each day, in the past tense. There are those, including the President, who question the veracity of the U.S. coronavirus death estimates. That skepticism doesn’t cohere with reality. Across the United States, excess mortality—the difference in the total number of deaths, from any cause, compared with a historical average—far exceeds official tallies of covid-19 fatalities. In all likelihood, there are more, not fewer, covid-19 deaths than we have confirmed. And the pandemic, in addition to devastating the economy, has caused enormous collateral health damage. Thousands of Americans have had their medical care postponed or cancelled, or have chosen to avoid health care altogether for fear of contracting the virus. Many have died. In the United States, peaks of panic have given way to plateaus of resignation. The country continues to record tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases each day but remains without a coherent plan to alter that trajectory. Because we never truly subdued the virus, we’re experiencing our newest waves on rising seas. In May, after strict lockdowns, the number of newly diagnosed cases levelled off at around twenty thousand per day. But September’s number is closer to forty thousand. We’re performing more tests, and that helps explain the higher number of new confirmed cases. But it’s also true that the virus is circulating in more places than before. Early in the pandemic, it became clear that a coherent and unified national response would not be coming. States were left to procure supplies and equipment on their own. Individuals and families waded through mixed messages about how contagious and lethal the virus was—and about how they might keep themselves and their loved ones safe. At the end of February, Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General, tweeted that masks are “NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus,” and Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., said that there was “no role” in the pandemic for masks worn by ordinary Americans. Those messages may have been intended to preserve mask supplies for health-care workers, but they seriously damaged the public’s trust in the information that was being provided by the country’s top health officials. It wasn’t until early April—after New York had logged tens of thousands of cases, and after the virus had seeded every state in the country—that the C.D.C. advised the public to begin wearing masks. (Redfield has since said that “cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus.”) It’s easy to focus on national numbers. But the story of the American pandemic is really that of a virus bobbing across the country, searching for oxygen as it’s tamped down in one region or another. A pandemic that began in dense metropolitan areas has now made its way to every part of the United States. In the Northeast, states that once stored dead bodies in refrigerated trucks are now among the safest in the country. Other states, including California and Ohio, took early and decisive action but have seen cases and deaths rise over time. At the beginning of June, new covid-19 hot spots were more likely to be rural counties than urban ones. By then, the virus had crept into small towns and ski resorts, the Navajo Nation and the rural South, and into prisons, retirement communities, and meatpacking plants, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. By staying home and flattening the curve, Americans succeeded in buying time for many health-care systems to adjust. The likelihood of dying of covid-19 has declined substantially since the pandemic began, in large part because we’ve gotten better at preparing for and treating the disease. A statistic called the case-fatality rate (C.F.R.) measures the percentage of people who go on to die after being diagnosed with a disease. States where the pandemic hit early—New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts—ended up with C.F.R.s above seven per cent; the national average is now about three per cent, thanks to lower death rates in states where the virus spread later. In recent months, therefore, the apocalyptic elements of the pandemic have receded from view. There are fewer places where endless streams of patients confront dwindling I.C.U. capacity; there are fewer bidding wars for ventilators and N95s. We’ve settled, instead, into a grinding battle, in which lives are lost incrementally but no less tragically. Six thousand dead in Georgia; two thousand in Minnesota; fifteen hundred in Nevada. It’s these small yet significant numbers, adding up month after month, that have gotten us to two hundred thousand. The coronavirus has assailed America’s image of itself. How does one reconcile the deaths of two hundred thousand people—a fifth of all the covid-19 deaths in the world—with the idea of an exceptional America, a compassionate America, a scientifically advanced America? The most piercing question has come to be whether we live in a just America. Inequalities in income, housing, employment, and medical care have resulted in Black and brown Americans dying of covid-19 at higher rates than whites. The pandemic has especially hurt low-income Americans, many of whom are now out of work, but Congress remains locked in a stalemate over whether and how to deliver relief. Meanwhile, in some states, more than half of all covid-19 deaths are linked to nursing homes, where many older Americans have died without being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. We tolerate these deaths because of a communal ageism. Our inability to protect the most vulnerable Americans has become both a public-health failure and a moral stain. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? The U.S. holds the unhappy distinction of suffering the most coronavirus deaths in the world. Still, adjusted for population, it ranks ninth among countries with significant numbers of cases, landing between the United Kingdom and Italy—bad, but not the worst. The case-fatality rate in America as a whole—three per cent—is also substantially lower than in many other developed countries: the C.F.R. is fifteen in the U.K., and fourteen in Italy. C.F.R. is not a perfect statistic: it’s calculated using the number of confirmed cases, not total infections, and so it fluctuates depending on how much testing is done among different populations. (If you test mostly older, hospitalized patients, as the U.S. did at the start of the pandemic, then the C.F.R. will appear higher, because a relatively high proportion of them will go on to die.) One way to understand America’s lower C.F.R., therefore, is to look at its demography. Age remains the most important factor for predicting how deadly the coronavirus pandemic will be: Americans over the age of sixty-five account for nearly eighty per cent of the country’s covid-19 deaths. Across the world, a country’s case-fatality rate is highly correlated with the age of its population. In Uganda, where the median age is sixteen, the C.F.R. is one per cent. The median age is forty-six in Italy, and is forty in the U.K. We might conclude that the U.S. is lucky to be a relatively young nation, with a median age of thirty-eight. (On the other hand, Japan—one of the world’s oldest countries, with a median age of forty-eight—has mounted an exemplary response to the pandemic and has a C.F.R. of only two per cent.) The excess death toll is less likely to be skewed by confounding variables. It seems to be similar in the United States and Europe, once it’s been adjusted for size. There’s no question that the U.S. squandered valuable time early in the pandemic, and it’s clear that the country has since failed to develop the infrastructure necessary to effectively control the virus. But European countries, such as France and Spain, have also struggled, and are now seeing resurgent coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The U.S. also isn’t the only country that’s been unable to protect its most vulnerable citizens. A high proportion of the covid-19 deaths in Canada and Sweden have happened in nursing homes. In the U.K., Black people also die of covid-19 at much higher rates than whites, even though its nationalized health system generally does a better job than ours at reducing inequities in access to medical care. As bad as Trump has been on masks, citizens of other Western democracies resist wearing them, too. As troubling as our pandemic response has been, the largest gap may not be between our performance and that of other countries but between our pre-pandemic understanding of America and what we now see revealed. The United States spends more on scientific research than any other nation and, as recently as 2019, was ranked the world’s most prepared to handle a pandemic—and yet our response has been strictly mediocre, and unusually fractious, politicized, and confused. How much of America’s struggle is due to bungled leadership—Trump’s distraction and disinformation, governors who’ve been slow to embrace masks or restrict gatherings—and how much is the result of long-standing features of our political and public-health systems? Answering that question is more than an academic or partisan exercise, and it behooves us to answer it honestly; what we find will have implications for identifying what’s broken and figuring out how to fix it. In the meantime, a recent survey of people in thirteen high-income countries found that confidence in America has plummeted during the pandemic: it’s now as low as it’s been at any point in recent history. It’s not all bad. Our doctors, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies have been world-class. Many American hospitals rapidly and dramatically transformed to accommodate the deluge of critically ill covid-19 patients; many doctors found ways to provide care through telemedicine. Meanwhile, in less than a year, researchers have discovered an extraordinary amount about the biology, transmission, and treatment of a never-before-seen virus. Vaccine development is proceeding at unprecedented speed, aided by cutting-edge advances in biotechnology; enormous investments in clinical trials mean that dozens of drugs may soon be available to reduce the spread and deadliness of the virus. Much of this work builds on decades of biomedical research, a lot of which has been publicly funded. If the coronavirus had emerged just twenty or thirty years ago, we would have far less reason to be hopeful about better treatments or a cure. Now, even though our efforts to contain the virus have stumbled, researchers stand a good chance of helping ourselves and the world. Step by step, we have developed a nuanced picture of how the virus spreads. In the beginning of the pandemic, we worried a lot about contaminated surfaces; now we know that they aren’t a major driver of transmission. (Wash your hands and avoid touching your face; but there’s probably no need to scrub your mail.) We understand that the virus travels primarily through respiratory droplets exhaled by infected people and through microscopic secretions known as aerosols. Droplets, which are relatively large, quickly fall to the floor, but aerosols can float in the air for minutes or hours, making poorly ventilated indoor spaces, such as movie theatres and campaign rallies, especially risky. It took time, and the collaborative efforts of scientists around the world, to come to grips with the aerosol threat. The World Health Organization maintained that aerosol spread was worrisome mainly during medical procedures, until July, when two hundred and thirty-nine scientists signed an open letter urging it to revise its assessment. At that point, the W.H.O. released a statement acknowledging that aerosol-based transmission in restaurants, gyms, and other crowded spaces “cannot be ruled out.” Many reopening plans were revised accordingly—favoring the outdoors over the indoors, and urging the opening of windows and the upgrading of ventilation systems when indoor activity was unavoidable. Early in the pandemic, we didn’t fully grasp the challenges posed by asymptomatic transmission. We now know that people can start “shedding” the virus several days before they develop symptoms; in fact, viral loads seem to peak just when symptoms are starting to appear. A recent study, not yet peer-reviewed, found that three-quarters of coronavirus transmissions occur in the two to three days before or after people develop symptoms. Because asymptomatic carriers, who may account for as many as forty per cent of infections, can also transmit the virus, it’s clear that curtailing the spread requires everyone’s participation—even the participation of those who don’t think they are sick. (That recognition is one reason that recent C.D.C. guidance that asymptomatic people should not be tested was met with widespread criticism by scientists. The C.D.C. has since reversed its recommendation.) Our understanding of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has also evolved. It’s become clear that, though it primarily affects the lungs, it can damage hearts, brains, blood vessels, and other organs. It can also linger, creating a growing cohort of “long-haulers” who continue to experience symptoms weeks, even months, after infection. One study of hospitalized patients found that nearly ninety per cent still experienced at least one symptom—most commonly fatigue or shortness of breath—two months after getting sick. Another study of non-hospitalized people who had tested positive for the coronavirus found that, weeks later, more than a third had not returned to their usual state of health. Among younger Americans without chronic medical problems, one in five continued to have symptoms. In all of these ways, we’ve taken a more accurate measure of our foe. But there are still many unanswered questions—among them, how long immunity lasts. sars-CoV-2 has not turned out to be a champion mutator in the vein of influenza or H.I.V. Still, we don’t know whether immunity to the virus will wane with time, allowing previously infected people to become susceptible to it again. The answer has huge implications for individual behavior, public policy, and vaccine efficacy. So far, less than a year into the pandemic, there’s no evidence of widespread repeat infections. But infections of most respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses, do not confer lifelong immunity—and it’s too early to tell with sars-CoV-2. Even as we continue to learn about the virus, there’s a sense in which we already know what we need to know—and have known for some time. For months, we’ve known the essential steps to containing the virus: testing, tracing, masks, and distance. We also know that, as bad as things have been, it’s possible for them to get worse. In many parts of the country, winter will soon close off opportunities to dine and gather outdoors, forcing us inside, where the virus is more likely to spread. One widely cited model has the American covid-19 death toll doubling to four hundred thousand by January, 2021. That outcome is far from inevitable, but escaping it will require a more thorough and united approach to the pandemic than we’ve managed to date. It will require us to act more effectively on what we know. Moments of tragedy are also moments of possibility. We search for meaning in grief, hoping to find some purpose in our suffering, or at least some reassurance that we will emerge stronger and more prepared in the future. In the past, catastrophes, both natural and man-made, have led to new ideas, laws, and cultural and political paradigms. Social Security, food stamps, and a more robust safety net emerged from the Great Depression. In mid-century America, people hoping to report an emergency had to find and dial a local phone number or ask for an operator, leading to delays, confusion, and needless tragedy; the gruesome murder of Kitty Genovese—which, at the time, was said to have been witnessed by thirty-eight people, none of whom called the police—was partly responsible for the invention of the 911 system we use today. In the nineteen-sixties, the U.S. recorded about twice as many car-crash fatalities per person as it does now (in some years, more than fifty-two thousand people died); then came seat belts, airbags, and the enforcement of drunk-driving laws. Viktor Frankl, the famed psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, once said that “everybody in the midst of suffering is given a chance to bear testimony of the human potential at its best, which is to turn a personal tragedy into a human triumph.” The monumental loss of life during the coronavirus pandemic so far could push us toward a better future. It could help restore a belief in independent science and competent government. It may help us value the essential work performed by society’s most marginalized people. And it could lead us to create a public-health infrastructure that spares future generations of Americans a similar fate in the inevitable pandemics to come.

How Utah’s Tech Industry Tried to Disrupt Coronavirus Testing,36980,"At a White House briefing, on April 23rd, Mike Pence offered what he described as “encouraging news” about covid-19 testing. Commercial labs, he said, were processing a hundred thousand tests per day, and a number of states had developed “methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing.” One of the specific efforts that Pence identified was Test Iowa, a public-private partnership that the Vice-President said would “triple testing capacity” in the state. In the course of introducing the initiative, Pence mentioned two of the companies behind the project: Nomi Health, a health-care startup, and Domo, a cloud-software firm. Josh James, the founder of Domo, was ecstatic. “You’ve got to be kidding me!!” he wrote on Twitter. “So stoked that all of my team’s work and all their all-nighters are paying off.” Test Iowa was, in fact, the second statewide testing initiative launched by a group of Utah tech companies that included Nomi, Domo, and Qualtrics, an “experience management” firm. The project had originated, six weeks earlier, in their home state, as a philanthropic effort to respond to the covid-19 pandemic. Since then, it had transformed into a multistate commercial enterprise. The tech executives had procured thousands of covid-19 tests from a local company, arranged for the deployment of mobile testing sites, hired a small army of nurses to collect specimens, partnered with a laboratory near their companies’ headquarters, and signed a two-month contract with the state of Utah to provide three thousand tests per day. Their contract also included the development of an online-assessment tool, an algorithm to determine who would get a test, and a data-tracking crisis command center. Mark Newman, the thirty-seven-year-old founder of Nomi and one of the major drivers of the initiative, admitted openly that “none of us knew anything about lab testing” at the start of the effort. But Newman was nevertheless confident that a combination of creativity, willpower, and ingenuity had allowed him and a handful of other tech executives, in just a few weeks, to upend the established diagnostic-testing industry. It was, Newman said, “the exact same story of Clayton Christensen and disruptive innovation.” Having “put together a low-cost alternative that the incumbent providers just laugh at,” he and his colleagues were “going to take over testing capacity, and be the thing that’s there to solve this problem.” In addition to Utah and Iowa, which had purchased half a million tests, the group eventually signed agreements with state governments in Nebraska and Tennessee. Together, the four contracts were worth more than eighty million dollars. Despite these apparent successes, significant questions about the program’s performance began to appear in public shortly after Pence’s press briefing. On April 24th, a columnist for The Gazette, in Cedar Rapids, noted that TestUtah had conducted fewer than thirteen thousand tests during the first three weeks of the month, about a quarter of what it had agreed to provide the state. A week later, the Salt Lake Tribune published an investigation into the quality of TestUtah’s covid-19 tests. Citing internal e-mails from a testing task force that had been organized by the Utah Department of Health, the Tribune reported that the initiative’s results showed a lower proportion of positive tests than at other labs in the state. TestUtah, some members of the task force feared, might be missing a significant number of people who were sick with covid-19. “We have been watching TestUtah’s positivity rate closely and have had multiple discussions with them about different practices that may be impacting their testing results,” one state official wrote to his peers on the task force. Another member of the task force, Bert Lopansri, an infectious-disease doctor at a hospital chain called Intermountain Healthcare, was more direct. “This is a potential public health disaster that will be compounded by the fact that they are constantly promoting themselves publicly,” Lopansri wrote. “What alarms me the most is that they are expanding collection and testing with these unknowns about how their test performs.” A pandemic, he said, “is not the time for amateurs to learn.” The effort that would become TestUtah began in earnest on March 18th. On a Zoom-enabled virtual “town hall,” Newman proposed a plan that included as many as a hundred thousand tests “bought up front for the good of the community.” To achieve this, Newman said, Silicon Slopes, a nonprofit that promotes Utah’s tech industry, was asking for five million dollars in donations “so that we can increase the volume of tests, access to care, and community support.” The tests themselves would come from Co-Diagnostics, a small, publicly traded company based in Salt Lake City. Before the pandemic, Co-Diagnostics had sold tests for use in agriculture and mosquito abatement in the United States and clinical diagnostic tests abroad; its 2019 annual report said that the company did not “anticipate offering our tests in the United States in the near future.” But the dire shortage of covid-19 tests in the U.S. had caused the F.D.A. to relax its policies for the distribution of new diagnostic tests, which meant that, for the first time, Co-Diagnostics would be able to sell tests for clinical use in the United States. At the start of the pandemic, Utah had been, in many ways, better equipped than other states to deal with the testing crisis. Besides its public-health laboratory and a large lab operated by Intermountain Healthcare, it was home to arup, one of the country’s largest reference laboratories. During a Zoom meeting, on March 26th, Angela Dunn, the Utah state epidemiologist, said that the state had more than twice the capacity necessary to test everyone with covid-19 symptoms. Newman, however, disagreed. “I’ll be completely blunt, and I guess I’m sharing more from the perspective of the business community,” he said. “I think the posture of, ‘We have tests and there’s no demand for them’ is complete B.S.” Senior members of Utah’s state government felt similarly. “From very early on, the governor’s office had come forward and said that, in order to effectively crush the curve, we needed to be testing up to seven thousand people a day,” Robyn Atkinson-Dunn, who was, until recently, the director of Utah’s public-health laboratory, told me. “Because it was felt that the laboratory community wasn’t doing enough, the governor’s office put out this call to say, ‘Hey, whoever thinks they can solve this problem, come talk to us.’ And that’s when the Silicon Slopes guys came along.” Over the course of two weeks, the tech executives developed what was intended to be a comprehensive statewide testing infrastructure. At the program’s official launch, on April 2nd, Utah’s governor, Gary Herbert, called TestUtah “a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership.” The lieutenant governor, Spencer Cox, whom Herbert had asked to chair the state’s coronavirus task force, and who is a candidate to replace Herbert in this fall’s gubernatorial election, called the program “a game changer.” Two days later, the actor Ashton Kutcher retweeted a post about the program and added, “seems to me we should roll this out state by state.” Newman, for his part, estimated that TestUtah would soon be able to process three to five thousand tests per day, and boasted that it was “going to be the hub of absolutely kicking butt across the country.” Within Utah, however, concerns about the initiative arose almost immediately. One question was why TestUtah’s online assessment asked users whether they were allergic to hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus drug that raised hopes, early on, of a possible treatment for covid-19, and whose effects, in the absence of much evidence, President Trump had praised as “like a miracle.” From the beginning, Newman had envisioned treatment as a central pillar of TestUtah’s efforts, along with assessment and testing. In an e-mail he’d sent to his peers in Utah’s tech industry, in March, which was first obtained by the Salt Lake Tribune, Newman said that he was negotiating access to twenty thousand “med packs,” which included hydroxychloroquine, through a local pharmacy chain called Meds in Motion. By the time TestUtah launched, however, medical opinion had begun to turn against hydroxychloroquine; one prominent Utah physician warned state officials in late March that making the drug available without a prescription, as they had been discussing, “could be a grave mistake medically.” On April 24th, the Tribune reported that Newman sat on the board of directors of Meds in Motion. The pharmacy chain’s owner, anticipating a run on the drug, had purchased eighteen hundred pounds of hydroxychloroquine, some of which he sold to Utah at elevated prices before the state unwound the contract. In a statement, Nomi, Newman’s startup, told me that “there was no conflict of interest.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Could Overtime Larry Change the Game of Teen Hoops? A more persistent concern about TestUtah was its funding. At the launch, Clint Betts, the executive director of Silicon Slopes, had promised that “no tech company is going to make any money off of this. We’re going to make sure of that.” A few hours later, on a Zoom call with the governor, the lieutenant governor, and others, Ryan Smith, whose company, Qualtrics, had designed the online assessment for TestUtah, said, “We’re happy to help. We’re doing it all for free.” Smith, who wore a crisp white hoodie and a black Silicon Slopes ball cap, acknowledged that there would always be skeptics, but said that “they should know by now, we’re all just trying to help because our families are here. There’s nothing else to read into. There’s no angle.” By the next day, however, the TestUtah tech execs were offering a different financial picture. On a Zoom call that afternoon, Betts asked Newman to “talk about what we mean by nobody’s making a profit, or clarify or help clean up whatever I may have said.” Newman told him, “Let’s be clear. There are costs in facilitating all of this: tents, generators, heat, electricity, people, cones, security, public safety, tests, swabs, test kits, extraction kits, you name it.” Newman did not quite promise not to take any profits. “There will be no profiteering,” he said. “If we were going to try to make money, we would tune this up as fast as we can and go sell it to New York.” As the Tribune would later report, the companies involved in TestUtah had already negotiated their agreements, worth more than five million dollars for two months of services, with the state. Newman and others in the group had been holding Zoom town halls to track the progress of their initiative. The day after TestUtah launched, he said that more than thirty-five thousand people had completed the digital assessment, more than twenty-five hundred people had scheduled covid-19 tests, and more than eight hundred had visited one of the two drive-through testing sites to be swabbed. “It took any state weeks and weeks to ramp up to this type of volume,” Newman said. “We’ve done this in twenty-four hours.” On an earlier call, Newman had boasted of creating “an open-source system around the supply chain: the swabs, the transfer kits, the extractive reagent, the test kits, the labs, and the machines to run it.” Behind the scenes, however, not everything was running as smoothly as he suggested. According to Atkinson-Dunn, at the state lab, the initiative ran headlong into the same shortages every other lab in the country was facing. “They needed swabs,” she said. “They found a local distributor here in Utah who said he could get product out of China. But, after about a week or so, their shipments were not coming in from China. And so TestUtah came to us and said, ‘Hey, we’re out of stuff. We’re going to be out of commission. Can you help us out?’ ” (Nomi confirmed that it “borrowed swabs while we waited on one of our orders during the start of the pandemic.”.) Early on, the executives running TestUtah had also been unaware that the R.N.A. extraction kits and reagents that were necessary to prepare specimens to be analyzed, which were in short supply across the country, were not included with the Co-Diagnostics tests. At one point, Newman acknowledged that they “totally didn’t anticipate” the need to acquire those components. Unable to secure a reliable supply of extraction kits, TestUtah eventually purchased a relatively unknown extraction machine called an oKtopure. The instrument, one member of the group said, “would allow us to do up to eight thousand tests a day. We would be considered the highest-throughput private infectious-disease lab in the country.” Josh Walker, the C.O.O. of Nomi, told me that this was a prime example of the initiative’s “open source” approach. “Part of the value that we as a group brought to the table,” he said, “is having deep health-care expertise but also this cross-pollinated team.” Atkinson-Dunn told me that she and other members of the testing task force were also concerned about the laboratory the group had chosen to process the tests, at Timpanogos Regional Hospital, in Orem, Utah. After the program launched, Atkinson-Dunn and another state official went for a visit. There was no placard on the door to the room where the R.N.A. extraction was being performed, and the floor was gridded with glue lines where tiles had been pulled up. “We went into a room that looked like a storage closet,” she told me. “They had an old rickety desk that looked like it was from the nineteen-seventies with the oKtopure sitting on top of it.” A conference room nearby had been converted into auxiliary lab space, with polymerase chain-reaction machines and laminar-flow boxes lining the walls around a large conference table. Atkinson-Dunn said that she was struck not only by the carpet on the floor—“carpet in a lab is not recommended”—but also by the fact that the lab was using Glad Press’n Seal to close up its specimens. “I said to them, ‘Have you done a test to make sure that whatever might be on that Press’n Seal is not interfering with your tests?’ And they said, ‘Well, how would covid get on the Press’n Seal?’ ” (A spokesperson for MountainStar Healthcare, which operates Timpanogos, said that “while the covid-19 lab space certainly does not look like that of our standard lab operations, it meets all requirements.”) On April 21st, the governor of Iowa, Kim Reynolds, launched Test Iowa. She had learned about TestUtah from Kutcher, an Iowa native. “This will make available five hundred and forty thousand covid tests, to increase the state’s testing capacity by up to three thousand additional tests per day,” Reynolds said. The state’s no-bid contracts paid the three companies a total of twenty-six million dollars for a year of tech services and six months of testing. Newman, appearing on video, told the governor that “what was successful for Utah was mobilizing the private sector and the supply chain behind it from non-obvious sources.” Utah was the “test bed” for the new model, he said. “We’re incredibly excited to bring this across the nation.” At the same time, the three companies were also signing no-bid agreements with the state of Nebraska. Like Iowa, Nebraska paid twenty-six million dollars for a year of assessment and tracking, and for five hundred and forty thousand Co-Diagnostics tests. In each of the three states, the companies’ knack for branding, their carefully orchestrated social-media campaigns, and their close coördination with the governors’ offices quickly helped them become the public face of covid-19 testing. But the group was also dogged by persistent questions about the quality of their efforts. In Iowa, according to internal e-mails obtained by The New Yorker, Michael Pentella, the director of the Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory, said that his lab was having trouble validating the Co-Diagnostics test, a procedure meant to insure that the tests are accurate. “This testing is very labor intensive,” he wrote in an April 27th e-mail, “and therefore, there is more potential for error.” The next day, Pentella said that he was “very concerned,” in part because “the company is not supporting this as they should.” In a separate e-mail that same day, a Tuesday, he warned, “If this test validation is not completed by Thursday, it could turn into a nightmare.” An official with the governor’s office, responding to Pentella’s concerns, laid out a plan to divert the Test Iowa specimens to another lab for processing, and, eventually, “to Utah for testing.” (According to Nomi, the plan was never enacted, and the samples remained at the Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory.) In Utah, however, there were also problems. For weeks, several members of Utah’s coronavirus-testing task force had been worried that TestUtah’s tests might be returning negative results for people sick with covid-19. “The biggest thing was, early on, they were getting levels of positivity that were significantly lower” than those found by other labs in the state, one participant told me. Of the eighteen thousand or so tests conducted by TestUtah during April, the Tribune reported, only about two per cent had come back positive, whereas arup, Intermountain, the public-health lab, and other labs in the state were averaging a positivity rate of at least five per cent. In Nebraska, the situation seemed to be even worse. The Omaha World-Herald reported that Test Nebraska’s positivity rate was 3.4 per cent; meanwhile, other labs in the state were seeing positive results at a rate of nearly eighteen per cent. Nomi Health, the labs in Utah, Iowa, and Nebraska, and Co-Diagnostics have repeatedly disputed any suggestion that there were problems with their tests. The e-mails from Pentella, Nomi told me in a statement, “reflect expected frustrations faced during this validation process, but the main thing Iowans should be focused on is whether or not the lab is functioning properly. It is.” The company noted that Pentella was eventually able to validate the Co-Diagnostics tests, though that validation did not happen until two weeks after Pentella’s warnings. Co-Diagnostics, too, acknowledged that “there may have been frustrations expressed,” but said that “it is our understanding that the Iowa lab is comfortable with the Co-Diagnostics test.” Pentella declined multiple requests for an interview, but, through a spokesperson, said that the ability of his lab “to exponentially expand its testing capabilities, including validating the Test Iowa equipment, during a public health crisis speaks volumes about its leadership, its staff, and the support and cooperation of state leaders.” As for the positivity rates, the companies argue that the discrepancies were caused by differences in the populations being tested. “If you’re only seeing the sickest patients that have the highest probability of being sick, of course your positive rates are going to be higher,” Walker, of Nomi, told me. “The state of Utah has asked us to do a very different thing, which is to not only make testing available to those who are exhibiting all the symptoms and signs. They also gave us very clear direction to expand the testing access to people that are asymptomatic.” The governor of Nebraska, Pete Ricketts, offered a similar explanation when pressed by a reporter for the Omaha World-Herald. “If you’re testing non-symptomatic people, your chance of getting people who are testing positive is going to be lower, right?” Ricketts said. Several laboratory directors told me that it was possible that population differences played a role in the positivity disparities, and perhaps a significant one. But, as the Tribune investigation noted, the divergence in the positivity rates remained apparent even after controlling for asymptomatic patients. “We could see all of the tests,” Atkinson-Dunn told me. “We were separating out symptomatics and asymptomatics, and it was still a lower positivity rate.” In addition to the specimens provided by the initiative, the lab at Timpanogos Regional Hospital was also processing tests for other hospitals operated by MountainStar in Utah. According to data obtained by The New Yorker, specimens collected by those hospitals during the first three weeks of May, after TestUtah adjusted its algorithm to include fewer asymptomatic patients, showed lower positive rates than tests that were handled by other labs. By May 9th, concerns about the quality of TestUtah’s processes were serious enough that they caused the state to ask the group to send its specimens to arup. “This has certainly got all of us scratching our heads a little bit,” Brent Satterfield, the chief scientific officer of Co-Diagnostics, told me recently. Satterfield insisted that his company’s test had consistently shown high levels of sensitivity, which measures how well a test picks up true positives, and specificity, which measures how well a test identifies true negatives. The validation at the Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory, he noted, found a ninety-five-per-cent sensitivity rate for the Co-Diagnostics tests, meaning that they correctly identified nineteen out of every twenty true positives. Sensitivity and specificity are important measures of a test’s accuracy, but they are not the only criteria by which to judge a diagnostic test. The limit of detection, or L.O.D., describes the concentration of a target pathogen that must be present for a test to consistently return a positive result. A test with a high L.O.D. may detect people who are acutely ill, when they are carrying a high viral load, but struggle to identify patients who are at the beginning or end of their illness, when the viral load is lower. Steven Hinrichs, the former director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory, told me that, for a disease like covid-19, which appears to do much of its spreading while people are presymptomatic, it is important to have tests that can identify people in the early stages of infection, so that those people can be isolated and their contacts traced. According to Co-Diagnostics’ own reports, filed with the F.D.A., the company’s test has an L.O.D. of 4,290 copies per milliliter. This is not out of the range of other tests the F.D.A. has authorized, but it is at the high end: the L.O.D. for one of the covid-19 tests developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is one thousand copies per milliliter, and the L.O.D. for the test developed by Quest is a hundred and thirty-six copies per milliliter. Satterfield dismissed concerns about the L.O.D. of the Co-Diagnostics test. “I like to compare it to cars,” he said. “When going out and buying a car, the max speed that that car can hit is an important factor. If it can only do thirty miles an hour, it’s probably not going to be a very useful car. But there’s a certain point, once you hit seventy or eighty miles an hour, that it’s doing everything that you’re going to ever need it to do.” Mark Oliver, an infectious-disease doctor in Utah, who has spoken with Satterfield about his company’s test, rejects the analogy. “Their belief was, ‘Well, it’s going to pick up the same number of cases, because the viral load that individual patients have is always above a certain threshold.’ I just don’t believe that.” Especially in asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases, Oliver said, “there are individuals who may have low viral loads.” Sensitivity, specificity, and L.O.D. are all analytic measures of a test’s performance; they’re determined with known samples in a carefully controlled laboratory environment. But a covid-19 diagnostic test is not a momentary procedure; it is a process. A patient must be swabbed, the swab must be transported to a lab, a sample must be extracted and isolated from the swab, and the sample must be run through many cycles of a polymerase chain reaction to determine if the coronavirus is present. Hinrichs said that the collection and extraction of a sample can have dramatic effects on a test’s clinical sensitivity. The testing initiatives associated with TestUtah have had documented issues on both fronts. In a statement, arup said that it was unable to test roughly ten per cent of the samples TestUtah had provided on May 9th, because of “insufficient volumes.” I asked Satterfield, of Co-Diagnostics, if he knew what had caused that problem. “There was leaking or something from the tubes,” he said, speaking of the collection tubes in which swabs are transported to the lab. “I talked with somebody from another part of the Nomi Health conglomerate, and they told me when people don’t screw the lids on properly, they leak. They aren’t getting screwed on properly at the time of collection.” (According to Nomi, “The TestUtah specimens—like the sample collection in Iowa and Nebraska—had sufficient volume for testing by our lab partners consistent with the requirements of the [Co-Diagnostics] FDA-authorized test.”) Another factor contributing to the low positivity rates might be the extraction step, a part of the testing process that Hinrichs describes as “a big, big deal.” The oKtopure extractor, which TestUtah had boasted could perform up to eight thousand extractions per day, was designed for agricultural, not clinical, use. According to the company that manufactures it, LGC Biosearch—which also produces some of the reagents for Co-Diagnostics’ test—“the oKtopure instrument has been optimised to deliver extraction protocols across a wide variety of plant species and is suitable for extraction from leaves, seeds, flour or roots.” In principle, there is no reason why an extractor built for use with plant D.N.A. could not work with viral R.N.A. samples in humans. But the oKtopure has not been through the rigorous pre-market review process that the F.D.A. uses to guarantee that instruments used on human specimens are safe and effective. According to a so-called bridging study conducted by the Timpanogos Regional Hospital, which measures the limit of detection, the use of the oKtopure had a real effect on the performance of the Co-Diagnostics test. The study showed that the limit of detection for the test, when used with the oKtopure extractor, was nearly thirteen thousand copies per milliliter, three times the L.O.D. reported in the company’s application with the F.D.A. Hinrichs told me that the higher limit of detection could very well be the reason that TestUtah’s tests were coming back with a lower positivity rate than those of other labs. “If you don’t get much R.N.A. out of a sample,” he said, “you’ve dealt yourself a blow.” Timpanogos maintains that the higher L.O.D. has no clinical significance, but, when I asked Satterfield if he thought the extractor could account for some of the discrepancies, he allowed, “It could be a part of it.” It also appears that Timpanogos was not authorized to use the oKtopure for much of April. Though the F.D.A. has relaxed some of its requirements for covid-19 tests, it nevertheless recommends certain procedures to guarantee test quality. To use a new component, such as an R.N.A. extractor, with a test, a lab must complete a bridging study, file for its own emergency authorization, or rely on an amendment to a manufacturer’s authorization. When I asked Satterfield what Timpanogos had done, he initially told me that he didn’t know. “We made it clear that the LGC device was not part” of Co-Diagnostics’ authorization, he said. “What they did with their process, that I’m not familiar with.” Michael Baumann, the chief medical officer at MountainStar, said that Timpanogos had “followed the F.D.A. process.” After validating the instrument on April 9th, he said, the lab began using it pursuant to an amendment filed with the agency by Co-Diagnostics. But Timpanogos did not conduct its bridging study until May 1st, and Co-Diagnostics, the company eventually told me, did not file for an amended authorization that included the oKtopure until May 8th, nearly a month after TestUtah began using the instrument. The F.D.A., which declined to comment, is clear that failing to follow its guidelines is not a crime. And, while the amended authorization has not yet been approved, Timpanogos says that the agency has not objected to the use of the oKtopure. Nevertheless, the failure to properly authorize the oKtopure was one of nineteen separate deficiencies identified by federal regulators at Timpanogos in May. According to a twenty-seven-page inspection report obtained by The New Yorker, the Timpanogos lab “failed to establish specificity, sensitivity, limits of detection, and reportable range for covid-19 testing prior to performing patient testing on April 10, 2020.” The inspection report identified other problems as well: the lab did not properly track specimens as they moved through the testing process; it performed tests on leaking samples; it failed to properly maintain the oKtopure; and it stored samples at room temperature, despite a recommendation from Co-Diagnostics that they be stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius. The report noted that the lab took no corrective action after several test runs indicated “errors that could . . . yield invalid or incorrect test results.” It also faulted the lab’s director for being “unavailable to the laboratory from approximately March 27, 2020 until April 27, 2020”—which included nearly the whole first month of TestUtah’s operations and the implementation of the oKtopure—and the lab’s general supervisors for failing “to provide day-to-day supervision of testing personnel and reporting of test results.” In a cover letter, the regulators warned that if Timpanogos did not remedy the problems, the lab could be liable for sanctions that include suspension of its certification or penalties of more than six thousand dollars a day. Through a spokesperson, MountainStar said that the lab’s director was “in the high-risk category for covid-19 and has been following guidelines to isolate at home,” and that “delegation for all validation and in-lab oversight throughout the covid-19 testing process was given to an interim medical director.” The spokesperson also said that “if there were any major concerns discovered during the [inspection], the lab would have been immediately shut down. This was not the case.” Nomi, for its part, whose publicity materials say that the company is “responsible for supplying and delivering FDA-authorized tests,” told me, “We trust our partners are delivering quality care in a compliant way,” and claimed that those partners “have shown significant transparency around the validation of their processes and have worked closely with state and federal regulators to share data and results.” During an early town hall for the TestUtah effort, Mark Newman put up a slide that counted “status quo,” “tradition,” and “turf wars” among the “barriers” the group had to overcome. Many of the people involved still share this view. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s a witch hunt,” Satterfield said. “What we’ve seen is that a lot of the opposition to the governors who are in office now”—by which he meant Herbert and Cox—“are the ones who have been most vocal about propagating” criticisms of TestUtah. (Cox’s office did not respond to multiple interview requests.) Baumann, at MountainStar, told me that he suspected that arup and Intermountain Health were working together to squash an entrant in the market. “They’re a little concerned that they’ve got a new competitor in the area,” he said. David Hillyard, the medical director of arup’s Molecular Infectious Diseases Laboratory, and Bert Lopansri, of Intermountain, both objected to that characterization. They offered the testing task force, which met over Zoom three times a week, and frequent exchanges of test supplies among their labs, as examples of the sort of collaboration that had taken place throughout the pandemic. Another testing-task-force participant, who works at neither arup nor Intermountain, told me much the same thing. “These are scientists. They don’t have it in for Co-Diagnostics or [MountainStar],” the person said. “They’re just questioning things. They want good tests out there.” Through a spokesperson, Jeff Burton, the acting head of the Utah Department of Health, said that “ensuring the accuracy of test results from all testing locations is critical to our response. We will continue to explore any process improvements that will enhance the accuracy of covid-19 testing in Utah.” On May 31st, the state government extended the TestUtah contract for another forty-five days. Since then, Utah’s covid-19 case count has been increasing at a worrying rate. Before June 1st, the state had not seen a day with more than three hundred and fifty new cases. On June 5th, there were five hundred and forty-six new cases, with outbreaks at a long-term-care facilities and a meat-packing plant in Cache County. Atkinson-Dunn told me that the increased demand for testing had created a backlog at the public-health lab. “Our capacity is a thousand samples a day, and we’ve been getting close to fifteen hundred samples,” she said. During the week of June 1st, Atkinson-Dunn arranged for some of the samples coming into her lab to be tested by Intermountain. That Friday, however, the day after the Tribune first reported a summary of the investigation at Timpanogos, her superiors at the Department of Health suggested that she offload some of the samples to the TestUtah lab. She refused. “I will not take the responsibility for public-health actions being taken from a laboratory that has evidence that they are not properly validated,” she told me. “I will not send samples to TestUtah until they can show that they have fixed their problems.” On Monday morning, Atkinson-Dunn was informed by her superiors that she was losing her position as the director of the Utah state laboratory and would be reassigned within the health department. Atkinson-Dunn’s official e-mail account was shut down, and her work phone was reclaimed. “They reassigned me to a position I’m not even trained for,” she told me. “They’ve assigned me to be an epidemiologist. I’m not an epidemiologist. It’s just a way for them to get me out of the way.” On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health confirmed that Atkinson-Dunn “has been reassigned as a Multi-drug Resistant Organism Specialist in our Bureau of Epidemiology” and said “this position will benefit from somebody with a laboratory background.” He also acknowledged that she had raised “serious allegations,” and said, “we take those allegations seriously. The Utah Attorney General’s Office will take the lead in reviewing her allegations.” Nevertheless, the spokesperson confirmed that the state overruled Atkinson-Dunn and sent samples from the public-health lab to Timpanogos for processing. In the past, health-department officials have defended TestUtah as a program that was developed quickly to meet a crucial need. I asked Atkinson-Dunn why, in the context of a pandemic driven by a shortage of national testing capacity, the regulatory issues at Timpanogos were so significant. “Play it out,” she suggested. “I might be sick, but I want to go see my grandma, who’s ninety-five. So I go to a TestUtah site, and I get tested. TestUtah tells me I’m negative. I go see grandma, and she gets sick from me because my result was wrong, because TestUtah ran an unvalidated test.” She went on: “All of us within the laboratory community take it very seriously that the answers we are giving people when we diagnose them with a disease are valid, so that that person can make rational decisions about what they need to do.” A previous version of this piece misidentified The Gazette.

America’s Looming Primary-Care Crisis,17866,"Beverly Jordan is a partner at a family-medicine clinic in Enterprise, Alabama. Enterprise is situated in “wiregrass country”—a largely rural region, encompassing southeastern Alabama and parts of Georgia and Florida, named for the ubiquitous vegetation that takes root in its sandy soil. Her clinic is one of a few offering primary care in the area; like many independent medical practices across the U.S., it has been gutted by the coronavirus pandemic. Even though her practice received a lifeline from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program (P.P.P.), Jordan had to take a pay cut, reduce staff hours, and lay off two new physicians who were about to start work. “For the first time in my career, we’re really just planning short-term,” she told me recently. “We’ve never had this level of insecurity.” For decades, health care was America’s indomitable industry. While employment in other sectors—retail, manufacturing, construction—rose and fell with the business cycle, clinics, hospitals, and medical practices steadily added jobs. But the pandemic has changed health care’s trajectory. Hospitals now find themselves in dire financial straits as they forgo revenue from elective procedures, and a surge in unemployment is shifting patients from private insurance plans to Medicaid, which is less remunerative for doctors. Some rural hospitals, whose financial footing was already tenuous, are facing the prospect of closure. Among the most vulnerable parts of the nation’s health-care system are family-medicine, internal-medicine, pediatric, and obstetrics-and-gynecology clinics. With covid-19 precautions in place, in-person appointments have dropped precipitously. In May, a survey of primary-care doctors found that nearly a fifth had temporarily closed their practices, owing to the pandemic, and two in five had laid off or furloughed staff. Primary-care clinics are tasked with keeping people healthy, and decades of research have shown that the care they provide is associated with better outcomes and lower costs. As my colleague Dhruv Khullar has written, the health consequences of these clinics’ closures could be significant. Vaccination rates for children have already begun to fall; patients are missing screenings proven to save lives; prescriptions are going unfilled. Chronic conditions could worsen; life expectancies could drop. Even before the pandemic, primary care was in crisis. Primary-care doctors were already among the most poorly compensated physicians in the country; for medical students burdened with debt, those smaller salaries lessened the specialty’s allure. Experts have long warned of a shortage of doctors providing foundational forms of outpatient care, especially in rural areas. Last year, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that more than fourteen thousand primary-care physicians were needed to eliminate existing shortages. For this article, I spoke with more than twenty primary-care physicians, from New York City to rural Nebraska and suburban Colorado. They work in single-physician practices, in multi-specialty groups, or as part of hospital systems. Nearly all of them described dramatic declines in revenue. Many benefitted from the P.P.P.; without it, some of their clinics might not have survived. All of the physicians expressed concern about how they would navigate the uncertainty ahead. “This is taking us down,” Jacqueline Fincher, an internist and the president of the American College of Physicians, told me. “We’re not going to have a vaccine and herd immunity for probably a year—so, is this sustainable for a year? The reality is, it’s probably not, certainly not for most small practices.” If many of them go out of business, the consequences for Americans’ health could be profound and enduring. What’s at stake is not just a pattern of health outcomes but the shape of the health-care system as a whole. The way that patients interact with their doctors and the path that American health care takes in the future may be about to shift. The challenges facing primary care are rooted in the structure of the American health-care system. This system wasn’t designed at any one moment; instead, it has accreted over time, with each new layer seeking to compensate for the deficiencies of what came before. One of the most consequential layers is fee-for-service payment, which was codified as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965—the law that created Medicare and Medicaid. In a fee-for-service setup, the payer, usually a health insurer or government agency, pays the health-care provider a set fee for any given service. Break your arm, and your insurance company might pay one fee for an X-ray, another for a splint, and a third for a follow-up visit. Though conceptually simple, the system has obvious flaws. It encourages health-care providers to offer more services, in order to earn more revenue, without necessarily controlling for quality. If one surgeon’s hip-replacement operation is successful, with no complications, but a second’s is complicated by infection, leading to a series of follow-up visits, their fees are still the same; in fact, the second hospital may make more money. “In a fee-for-service payment system,” Atul Gawande has written, “we are actually penalized for making the effort to organize and deliver care with the best service, quality, and efficiency we can.” To address this problem, government programs and insurers have come up with alternative payment schemes—but, at a fundamental, almost philosophical, level, many of them still operate on a fee-for-service principle. In the nineteen-eighties, Medicare changed its approach to inpatient hospitalizations so that a single global fee covered a particular admission; in this system, a hospital is reimbursed at one payment level for a broken leg, at another for pneumonia, and at a third for sepsis. More recently, the Medicare Access and chip Reauthorization Act of 2015 pushed Medicare reimbursements away from a pure fee-for-service model and toward others that pay based on the quality of health care provided. Still, for the most part, it’s the provision of services that indicates that care has happened. Ultimately, when physicians are paid, it’s the number of office visits, lab tests, and surgeries that matters. The fee-for-service principle reverberates through the whole health-care system, but it has especially dire consequences for primary care, because it favors discrete medical episodes over ongoing and preventative treatment. Payers routinely reimburse health-care providers for specialized procedures at high rates, but primary-care visits—which might include chronic-disease management, routine vaccinations, or smoking and diet counselling—generate lower revenues. This imbalance is due, in large part, to the Relative Value Update Committee (R.U.C.), an extraordinarily powerful group of doctors that advises the federal government on reimbursement rates for physicians. The R.U.C. consists of thirty-one doctors convened by the American Medical Association; it’s structured such that each specialty has an equal say. On the R.U.C., urology, thoracic surgery, and head-and-neck surgery have, individually, about the same representation as all of pediatrics. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (C.M.S.), which has final authority to set payment rates for Medicare, has in many years accepted the R.U.C.’s recommendations nearly ninety per cent of the time. Primary-care groups and health-care policy experts have long contended that the R.U.C.’s choices favor procedures over the counselling, education, and chronic-disease management that form the basis of primary care. Twenty years ago, Don Berwick, the co-founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a mentor of mine, called for a total reimagining of health-care reimbursement in a speech that has since become famous in industry circles. Addressing an audience at the institute’s annual meeting, Berwick told the story of a Montana forest fire, from 1949, that killed most members of a team of firefighters. When the firefighters finally realized the imminent danger posed by the blaze, they tried to outrun it—but they did so while shouldering heavy equipment, including their Pulaskis, special firefighting axes that combine an axe head with an adze. The firefighters did not recognize that, in this new scenario, their old tools no longer served them; many died carrying them. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist The health-care system, Berwick said, was falling into the same trap: clinging to a sometimes burdensome tool, no matter the circumstances. “Our Pulaski,” he argued, “is the encounter—the visit.” A better health-care system could only be built if “scientists, professionals, patients, payers, and the health-care workforce” agreed “that the product we choose to make is not visits. Our product is healing relationships.” In 2010, President Barack Obama, in a recess appointment, made Berwick the acting administrator of C.M.S.; he resigned, in 2011, when he concluded that he would be unable to win confirmation from Republicans in the Senate. Among other things, the structural bias in favor of procedures and office visits has prevented telemedicine—which could make outpatient care more affordable, accessible, and consistent—from gaining a foothold. For decades, Medicare only paid for telemedicine visits if a patient lived in a designated “rural” area or received the treatment in a medical setting; effectively, for many people, telemedicine had to take place in a doctor’s office. The pandemic has changed this equation. In March, the federal government expanded the list of telemedicine services eligible for Medicare reimbursement. Clinics across the country, seeing telemedicine as both a way to provide care and a financial lifeline, raced to embrace phone and video visits almost overnight. “I was so close to getting a ninety-year-old woman to turn on a video call,” Lalita Abhyankar, a family-medicine doctor in New York City, told me. Abhyankar persisted because she’s found that, on the whole, patients become enthusiastic about virtual visits after trying them. Doctors, for their part, have found value in the glimpses that such visits offer of their patients’ home lives. Early in the covid-19 crisis, when I began conducting telemedicine visits with my own patients, I was surprised to discover that the technology created a feeling of camaraderie. The power dynamic diminished; conversing from our respective apartments, we were on equal footing. For all the promise of this ongoing telemedical experiment, the future of primary care as a whole remains unclear. C.M.S. has said that the current dispensation is only a temporary emergency accommodation; if support for telemedicine stops before the pandemic does, our country will be taking a big risk. One preview of what might happen comes from studies assessing health outcomes after a patient’s primary-care doctor retires. Such patients don’t face a society-wide diminution in access to primary care; in many cases, they can switch to another physician without undue difficulty. Even so, a recent review of these studies found that nearly all patients experienced unfavorable outcomes, among them difficulty renewing prescriptions and increased use of high-cost care. Labor economists have long studied a phenomenon called hysteresis: in economics, it refers to a situation in which high unemployment caused by a particular event develops an inertia of its own, remaining elevated even after the initial cause has abated. Nobody is quite sure what causes hysteresis. Do workers’ skills erode? Or do firms find that they can get along with fewer workers? In any case, now that the pandemic has caused extended mass unemployment, hysteresis could play a major role in our society—and our health care. In theory, a physician can sit out the lean times and return to practice once patient volume rebounds; during the Great Depression, for instance, some small-town doctors made house calls and accepted barter payments until the crisis ended. But the situation today is different. A modern medical practice needs physical space, an electronic records system, malpractice insurance, and back-office support to handle the byzantine medical coding on which reimbursement depends. Hanging out a shingle in twenty-first-century America requires more than a diploma; it requires capital. Patients may also respond in an enduring way to what seems to be a temporary disruption of the doctor-patient relationship. In ordinary times, engaging people in the treatment of chronic conditions can be a fraught endeavor: a patient who’s easily persuaded to take an antibiotic for a urinary-tract infection might nevertheless resist taking a medication aimed at preventing complications from high blood pressure down the road. Regular checkups help patients develop and maintain fragile habits that the pandemic may have disrupted. “I have a diabetic patient who finally came in and hadn’t taken insulin in six weeks,” Gary LeRoy, a family physician in Ohio and the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. “It’s, like, ‘Why the heck did you not call?’ But, then, I don’t like going to the dentist—and if my dentist says, ‘Well, we’re not doing visits now,’ I think, Yay! I don’t have to go to the dentist,” he said. “It gives you an excuse to not do the right thing for yourself.” There are steps that governments and insurers could take now to prevent the crisis from worsening. Many commercial insurers and state-administered Medicaid programs still don’t reimburse video visits at the same rates as in-person care; parity is even less common for telephone visits, which are particularly useful for the elderly and for those in low-income or rural communities who don’t have access to high-speed Internet. Some surveys of primary-care practices show that more than half of them haven’t yet received reimbursement for most of their telemedicine visits in recent months—a significant problem at a time of financial strain. Through the cares Act and subsequent legislation, Congress has allocated a hundred and seventy-five billion dollars for health-care expenses attributable to the pandemic. How that money will be spent, however, remains unclear; those funds are also supposed to cover aid for hospitals and covid-19 care for the uninsured, among other things, and a hundred and seventy-five billion sounds less impressive when set against the $3.6 trillion that America spent on health care in 2018. The P.P.P. has helped some primary-care practices, but this is only a temporary lifeline. Without either an increase in funding or a direct allocation aimed at primary care, it seems likely that many clinics will never receive the money they need to stave off closure. Some policymakers and providers have proposed a more drastic response to the pandemic—one that’s long been contemplated by health-policy experts and is already getting a test drive as part of the Affordable Care Act. Instead of continuing to reimburse providers through a fee-for-service system, the federal government could shift payment for primary care and similar specialties to a so-called capitation model. Under this system, practices are reimbursed on a per-person, per-month basis, usually with some portion of the payment tied to quality measures, such as adjusted mortality and excess hospitalizations. Since the A.C.A.’s passage, C.M.S. has been shifting toward this payment model, using health-care networks called Accountable Care Organizations (A.C.O.s). (Texas’s U.T. Southwestern, Wisconsin’s ThedaCare, and New York and New Jersey’s Montefiore are examples of A.C.O.s.) Despite these efforts, most primary-care practices are still paid mainly on a fee-for-service basis. “A crisis is a terrible thing to waste,” the economist Paul Romer once said. The weaknesses that have left our primary-care system so vulnerable to the pandemic have been understood for decades, yet change has come at a glacial pace; it’s been easy to ignore the system’s flaws because health-care spending has grown over time, with many health-care organizations prospering as a result. Why undertake dramatic change when there is always more money to go around? Before the 2008 financial crisis, Charles Prince, who was then the C.E.O. of Citigroup, was asked why his bank continued to participate in the speculative real-estate market, given concerns that the bubble would soon burst. “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated,” he said. “But, as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” For much of American health care, the music has stopped. The best way to address the emergency is by embracing a better system. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

What Do College Students Think of Their Schools’ Reopening Plans?,17065,"After months of hemming, hawing, hand-wringing, and collecting student deposits, residential colleges and universities have started announcing their plans for the next academic year. A majority are planning to hold classes in person. Some, like Middlebury, a small liberal-arts college in rural Vermont, and Bard College, in upstate New York (where I will start teaching in August), are planning for most students to return to campus, and provisionally committing only to minor adjustments to the academic calendar. Some, like Bowdoin College, in Maine, and Amherst College, in Massachusetts (where I have been teaching), are reducing the number of students on campus and providing everyone with a single dorm room, and will transition to remote learning after Thanksgiving break. Others, like Oberlin College, in Ohio, are radically changing their academic calendars, switching to a three-semester, year-round schedule to insure that no more than two-thirds of students are on campus at any given time. Stanford will bring half of its undergraduates back to campus at a time, but it plans for most classes to be taught remotely, as does the University of California system. Harvard is bringing up to forty per cent of undergraduates back to campus, where they will take classes online. (On Wednesday, Harvard and M.I.T. sued the Trump Administration for its directive to strip foreign students of their visas if they have no in-person classes.) Some classes will meet outdoors—Amherst, for example, will erect tents for outdoor instruction, which will allow for social distancing. All schools are putting testing and contact-tracing protocols in place: Yale is planning to test students weekly, Bard will require students to arrive carrying negative test results, and Amherst is setting aside residence halls where students who have tested positive will be quarantined. Critics of the plans to bring students back to campus—any number of students, for any amount of time—have been merciless. Two law professors from Colorado, Peter Huang and Debra Austin, are publishing a sixty-five-page article, titled “Unsafe at Any Campus: Don’t Let Colleges Become the Next Cruise Ships, Nursing Homes, and Food Processing Plants.” Huang and Austin write, “We recognize that lost tuition revenue if students delay or defer education is an institutional concern,” but, they argue, “Our decision-making should be guided by the overriding principle that people matter more than money.” Their worst-case scenario is captured in the title, but their best-case scenario is dire, too: Students sitting in classrooms (or negotiating hallways or going to restrooms), concerned about becoming infected or bringing an infection home to at-risk loved ones, are under greater anxiety and stress than usual. Anxiety is a transient learning disability interfering with a student’s working memory, learning, recall, and capacity to complete tasks. Additionally, some students, staff, and faculty may experience what is known as mask anxiety, due to feeling the inability to breathe because of a pre-existing condition, such as asthma, or a snug face covering. Either possibility can lead people to take their masks off unsafely causing COVID-19 transmission risks. Although colleges have designed their reopening plans in coöperation with state public-health authorities and leading private medical institutions, their potential flaws are obvious. The coronavirus can likely be spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected people, so asking students to monitor themselves for signs of illness may not help. Tests continue to be unreliable, possibly especially for asymptomatic people. Many dormitories have shared bathrooms and showers in the hallways. The biggest variable that complicates reopening plans, however, according to many critics, are the students themselves. Scott Galloway, a business-school professor at N.Y.U., wrote a blog post eviscerating college administrators who are inviting students to return to campus. My 4th year at UCLA I was Interfraternity Council President (not on my LinkedIn profile). As king of the jarheads, I was privy to the tragedy that unfurled each week from the collision of youth, alcohol, and newfound freedom. In the same year, a Lambda Chi passed out from drinking on the roof of his fraternity, rolled off into the driveway, and was found the next morning in a coma. Our IFC VP (a Phi Kap) got shi**y drunk at a party in Malibu, decided to take a jetski out at 2 am, and washed up 5 days later. Our treasurer (Sigma Chi) hanged himself after his girlfriend rejected his marriage proposal. Yep, but today’s youth will definitely wear masks and keep 6 feet from each other off campus. Gen Z is by far the age group most likely to be asymptomatic. They are also most likely to feel immortal and defy healthcare guidance. So, both physically and psychologically, young people are most inclined to be superspreaders. Days after this post was published, the University of Washington, which was among the first schools to switch to remote learning, back in March, disclosed that at least eighty students living in off-campus fraternity houses had become infected with the coronavirus. The Seattle Times quoted Daniel Leifer, a pediatrician who is studying at U.W., who said, “I don’t hold it against college students that they’re partying with each other and getting to know each other, because that’s everyone’s college experience. It just doesn’t make for a safe campus. . . . A lot of college reopening plans are premised on students wearing masks and social distancing. This crystallized for me that that doesn’t seem very realistic.” A defense of campus life in the pandemic came from Cornell University, whose study concluded that fewer students and staff would likely get infected during an in-person semester than a remote one, because the university would be closely monitoring them. ""If we have a residential, on-campus semester, then we have the authority to put all kinds of expectations and requirements on our students,"" Martha Pollack, the president of Cornell, told Inside Higher Ed. She added that the university hoped to design “a series of escalations for dealing with misbehavior.” In other words, Cornell wasn’t challenging the premise that college students were likely to act irresponsibly but proposing that the university police them in person. And yet, for weeks, tens of thousands of people of college age have managed to keep themselves safe, healthy, and organized during mass protests nationwide. Data from New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere show that the protests have not produced a spike in covid-19; in cities that tested protesters specifically, the rate of infection among people who participated is the same as in the population at large. It no doubt helps that the protests are held outdoors, and that the vast majority of protesters wear masks. As I observed at Occupy City Hall, many people even sleep in masks. At marches large and small—beginning with the very first night of protests in New York City, which I spent with a jail-support team outside One Police Plaza, in Lower Manhattan—I have watched protesters handing out hand sanitizer and masks at all times, and there is always food, water, and first aid available. In my thirty-five years of protesting and reporting on protests, in this country and elsewhere, I have never seen this level of detailed, organized, and consistent mutual care. One of the popular call-and-response chants is “Who keeps us safe? / We keep us safe.” Another is “This is what community looks like.” Interdependence and shared responsibility are key elements of the protesters’ message and their identity. Community is what students seek when they attend college in person. Sometimes that community is found at parties, but the meaning of collegiate social connections cannot be boiled down to drinking and fraternities. Young people attend college to learn how to think, and thinking is rarely accomplished in solitude. Thinking outside of any conversation—the sort in which it is possible to look your interlocutors in the eye, unmediated by a screen—is difficult beyond measure. Learning alone is nearly impossible. As the pandemic-era explosion of online reading groups illustrates, we need others to help us understand, to articulate and repeat ideas in ways that make them stick in the memory, and to stay engaged. Let’s reframe the question by asking not whether colleges should get their tuition dollars by putting their students, faculty, and staff at risk but how to insure that the current generation of college students will be able to learn in a meaningful way. At Occupy City Hall, organizers have set up talks and teach-ins in a safe and responsible manner. Attendees have been learning about the workings of the police and city government, the politics of rent and housing, and the history of abolitionist movements, but, most importantly, they have been learning how to learn, together, while keeping one another safe. Colleges ought to be asking young people like them how to bring that knowledge, and that sense of care and responsibility, to campus. Instead, they are treating them alternately as clients and as children, people to be pleased or managed. Back in March, decisions to close campuses were made by administrations, sometimes preceded by discussions in hastily called faculty meetings. Plans for the fall have generally been devised by working groups that include representatives of a school’s faculty, its administration, and outside experts. These working groups have often surveyed students to gauge how likely they would be to return to campus if given the opportunity or to take a gap year instead of studying remotely, and how receptive they would be to safety protocols. Most schools do not appear to have asked students to help design their new learning environment. Sonya Dutton, who is about to start college at Williams, in western Massachusetts, told me, via e-mail, “If recent events have shown us anything, it’s that Gen Z is uniquely ready to mobilize if given motivation and a voice. Rules will be followed more if students have input and view following them as a community responsibility vs. rules put in place by out-of-touch admin.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? “If I were in higher education, I would be so much more aware of our generation,” Avalon Silver, a rising sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, told me, by Zoom. “I think they think we are the people who don’t want to be wearing masks.” Silver, a public-health major, has been struck by many of the same things that impressed me at the New York protests: community cohesion and the extent and reliability of mutual aid. She was impressed by one of the early demonstrations in Asheville, where the police destroyed a medics’ station that had been set up by protesters, slashing water bottles. When Silver herself joined the protests in Raleigh, she saw “people with wagons of water bottles walking around, asking if you need anything,” including masks. Silver suggested that students could help administrators rethink how colleges are interacting with students who are staying home, whether out of personal choice or because the university has asked them not to come to campus during a particular term. Such students, Silver told me, could organize themselves in local clusters by major; perhaps they could meet outside twice a week to discuss the material. “In Raleigh or in Asheville, we could go to a big park and sit and have intellectual conversations,” she said. The online portion of the spring semester was alienating, Silver said, and the idea of being able to connect with other students, at a distance but in person, was extremely appealing. Oli Schmitz, who has been taking part in protests in Milwaukee and studies at Vassar, proposed that the college employ novid, an app that tracks contacts and alerts people if they have been in proximity to someone who has tested positive for or been exposed to the coronavirus. Vassar plans to bring a majority of students to campus and offer mostly in-person classes; students will be required to stay on campus until Thanksgiving. An app like novid, Schmitz suggested, would insure that these rules are followed. When I started asking my college-age interlocutors to think more radically, to attempt to imagine a fall term that tapped more deeply into the energy and ethos of the protests, I got the reaction I normally do in the classroom the first time I make such a request: silence and some evident discomfort. Imagining a different and better way of doing things is, for most people, a process that requires collaboration, encouragement, and prodding. Like many kinds of thinking, it’s best done in a group. For college students, many of whose summer internships or travel plans fell through because of the pandemic, a series of seminars on reimagining college in the time of covid-19 would have made for a good study project. Perhaps it’s not too late. In my experience, when such a discussion works, when an entire group of students becomes convinced that things don’t always have to be done the way they are now—it can produce original, even visionary, ideas. What might students who have been protesting try to apply to college life? Perhaps they could form quarantine study pods. Like affinity groups in a protest movement, such pods would embrace mutual care and interdependence, and would live and learn together. Some colleges have suggested that small groups of students living on the same floor in a dormitory could coördinate their safety protocols, but they have not linked such plans to academics. If such communities were created, they might call for a new approach to the academic schedule and the curriculum. Perhaps, for example, pods could plan a curriculum for a year together and take month-long intensive classes, with a limited option of switching pods at certain intervals, following a period of self-isolation. Studying in month-long single-course blocks is not unheard of in American colleges, but it’s rare. (Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, does this.) In contrast to the difficult and depressing spring semester, Silver has found the protests not only energizing but educational. “I have been learning so much about public health in the Black community,” she said. “We have an inherently racist health-care system in America.” This basic fact was not new to her, but the depth and extent of discrimination and exclusion were. I asked Silver how, exactly, she has been learning, and how she knew that she could trust what she was learning. She said that she actively follows social media affiliated with the uprising, and the social media have led her to information she trusts because it’s located on .edu domains. In other words, the protests have prompted the public-health major to read academic papers. If colleges asked, they would probably find that many of their students are learning actively right now in similar ways, suggesting that an off-campus learning pod or smaller team might undertake a program of self-organized study in which the college plays a supporting role. My daughter, Yolka Gessen, a rising college freshman who has been protesting in New York, suggested that, rather than try to approximate normalcy in conditions when familiar ways of living and studying are either impossible or unsafe, college should embrace the revolutionary moment and help their students study as part of protesting. “Why try to make something that worked in the classroom work outside the classroom when you have access to something completely new outside?” she said. “And why try to make things as they were before when the world isn’t as it was before?” But who knows what else might happen if students were asked to take the lead in conceiving and organizing their education during the pandemic? I don’t. But it’s still not too late to find out. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

A Bellevue Doctor’s Pandemic Diary,43399,"It isn’t that the coronavirus doesn’t come up during our staff meetings in the early days of 2020. It’s more that it’s crushed to the bottom of the agenda by a pending hospital inspection—the triennial, bureaucratic steeplechase that we must run in order to maintain our accreditation. The first formal mention of the virus to the rank and file of our medical clinic comes in the weekly staff e-mail, on January 24th: —This is a novel coronavirus with its epicenter in Wuhan, China, with a ~14 day incubation period and potential for person-to-person transmission (though limited) —Thus far this virus appears to have a milder illness compared to MERS or SARS —Risk to New Yorkers is considered low, and there have been no known healthcare worker infections —There are currently 830 confirmed cases worldwide, 26 deaths, and 2 confirmed US cases Six years earlier, when Ebola attempted its global assault, Bellevue Hospital created its Special Pathogens Unit. The working philosophy on Ebola was: “If it’s coming to the U.S., it’s coming to Bellevue.” Our patients hail from nearly every country, the United Nations is just up the road, and, for nearly three centuries, Bellevue’s doors have remained open to all. With the coronavirus now percolating in Washington State, planning begins in earnest. The E-team, as it’s been known since Ebola, is reconstituted, and the four-room super-isolation unit is readied for the handful of patients expected to turn up. The next week, the staff e-mail informs us that there are “isolated cases in the US (6 total),” and that the E-team stands “ready to respond for any patient admitted for potential coronavirus evaluations, quarantine, or confirmed cases.” The same message is sent out the following week, and the week after that, and the week after that. On Monday, March 2nd, we’re told that the first coronavirus case has been documented in N.Y.C. “Remain vigilant at all points of entry at Bellevue and screen every person for fever, cough, rash AND travel history,” we’re advised. “In addition to the global outbreak of COVID-19, remember that there are also ongoing outbreaks of Ebola, Lassa, and MERS.” On Tuesday, March 10th, we line up in the morning for P.P.E. training, with all its attendant goofiness. Get serially spritzed with aspartame while bobbling your head inside a tent-like contraption balanced on your shoulders—if you can taste the aspartame, the seal on your N95 is leaky. In the evening, the first patient with the coronavirus is admitted to Bellevue. When we learn of this, there is a collective catching of the breath, and what feels like a communal churning of thought. Will this be like Ebola—intense but cordoned off into an isolated unit? Will it be like Hurricane Sandy—widespread havoc compacted into a single nightmarish week? Will it be like aids—ubiquitous, protracted, and exquisitely brutal? Or maybe the coronavirus will end up like brucellosis, Chagas disease, leprosy, and plague—just another of the many offbeat infections that periodically find their way to Bellevue, a hospital whose catchment area includes the mayor, the N.Y.P.D., and the President as well as the undocumented and the homeless, and everyone in between. Maybe it will assume its place among the legions of oddball “zebras” that keep us on our toes at Bellevue but don’t otherwise perturb our daily routines, other than to remind us why we’d never want to work anyplace else. Thursday, March 12th, is my first day in Bellevue’s new Primary Care Special Pathogens Clinic, a cramped three-room space which we all refer to simply as the covid Clinic. Room 1 hosts two fathers and their three-year-old daughter. Room 2 holds a set of millennial roommates who have been trying to socially distance in an apartment with one bedroom, one bathroom, and two cats. In Room 3, a mother gamely distracts her seven-year-old with a card game while her own darting panic saturates the air. To minimize contact, the initial medical evaluations are carried out by phone. Afterward, I gown up and gather supplies for the tests. A whirring, battery-powered hazmat helmet whooshes filtered air across my face. (“I wish I’d had this during menopause,” a colleague remarked.) The covid Clinic has been open for only three days, but the testing protocol has already changed at least that many times—with or without an influenza test, nasopharynx vs. oropharynx, double-bag vs. single-bag. I squeeze into Room 1 with four swabs, eight specimen bags, four tubes, double sets of labels, and double sets of gloves and face a workspace the size of a breadbox, plus a charming three-year-old who needs the potty, stat. My biggest fear is that I’ll mix up the tubes, or the swabs, or the bags, or the patients. The fathers are both tall, slim, masked, dressed in mid-thirties-dad casual. They are immensely gracious as I ask who is who over and over during the ordeal. For every patient I test, I duly recite the social-distancing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control, but these feel tailored for suburbia: isolate in a separate bedroom, use a separate bathroom and eating area, keep six feet apart from the rest of the household. This is New York City. Six feet apart at all times means someone’s going to end up out on the fire escape. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media And what happens when there’s no home at all in which to isolate? In the afternoon, a patient with a fever and a cough arrives for testing; he isn’t sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, but it’s too risky to send him back to the shelter where he’s living. Hours pass as we make calls, trying to figure out what to do. One nurse brings him a sandwich; another passes a urinal into the room. The clinic will be closing soon. We wonder if his shelter could somehow provide a single room and bathroom, but he doesn’t remember its name or its phone number. But this is Bellevue. Someone figures out the name of the restaurant next door to the shelter, calls the restaurant, persuades a waiter to run over and procure the phone number, calls the shelter, works out an arrangement for a private room, and then gets the patient home, all before the sun shimmers down over the Hudson River. According to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s briefing today, there are ninety-five confirmed cases in all of New York City, with twenty-two New Yorkers hospitalized. Italy is experiencing a steep rise. Bellevue’s Special Pathogens team has been strategizing about where extra hospital beds could fit. It’s Monday, March 16th: I’ve been desperately checking for the results of my covid Clinic tests. This afternoon, they finally start arriving from the testing lab, which, it turns out, is conveniently located in Alabama. I look first at the family of three. Father One is negative; the daughter’s test is still pending; Father Two’s test is “sample spilled.” Spilled? After all that preparation and anxiety? I’m crushed. The millennial roommates are next. Her test is negative. His, however, is marked with a garish red rectangle highlighting the word “Detected!!” next to the words “Novel Coronavirus.” It’s hard to convey how earth-shattering this first positive result is. On the day I’d swabbed him, covid-19 was still a disease in China and Italy; there hadn’t yet been a single coronavirus death in all of New York City. We had more gallstones in Bellevue than we had coronavirus. Now, for the first time, the virus feels in-my-hands real. It’s Wednesday, March 18th, and the covid Clinic has been reconstituted alfresco, in the shadow of Bellevue’s imperious, turn-of-the-century brick building. Open-sided to decrease infection risk, the white tent sits primly in the courtyard, hugged on three sides by a flowering dogwood, a magnificent magnolia, and a Callery pear tree laden with snowy blooms. But the open-sided tent of Abraham feels decidedly less welcoming amid the flood of Noah. The rain is furious; the corner where I’m swabbing one anxious patient after another has become a muddy lagoon. The temperature hovers near forty degrees, and we take turns doing jumping jacks to stay warm, looking like harbor seals with our bright yellow surgical gowns bulging over our down jackets. The steady, pelting rhythm of rain, the musty dampness of canvas, the petrichor of wet springtime lawn—this singular sensory combination evokes the gloriously sodden camping trips of my childhood, despite the surreal circumstances. On Saturday, March 21st, one of our nurses has a fever. We’re both in the covid tent, bundled up against yet another day of frigid rain, but I’m the only one wearing P.P.E., because she’s now the patient. As I ease the swab inside her nasopharynx, my mind scours frantically over the previous two weeks. Did we experience any breaches of protocol? Did we inadvertently expose her? In the urgency of reinvention, did we grow careless? I slip her sample into the bag and pray that it will be negative. It’s Monday, March 23rd. Over the past week, the number of coronavirus patients admitted to Bellevue has tripled—there are now close to a hundred. Meanwhile, the outpatient side of the hospital has screeched into reverse gear: a battalion’s worth of staff works the phones, doing its best to keep our seventy thousand outpatients away from the hospital at all costs. At his press conference, the Mayor announces that there are now twelve thousand three hundred and thirty-nine cases in the city, and that there have been ninety-nine deaths. New York is officially the epicenter of the pandemic. As of last night, the city is on lockdown. There are practically tumbleweeds on Madison Avenue. It’s Tuesday, March 24th, and I’m back at the primary-care clinic where I normally work. It’s strange to be inside after working outdoors in the tent for the past week. I’ve gotten used to prodigious natural light and crisp spring air. Sequestered in my six-by-six exam room, with its fluorescent lights and obdurate walls, I feel twitchy and trapped. Twelve hundred patients have me listed as their primary-care doctor. Internal medicine can often feel pedestrian—there are no edgy Netflix series about primary-care physicians counselling patients on sciatica. With the acute rupturing of our clinic system, primary care is suddenly a minefield. I call patient after patient, undertaking rudimentary triage without the aid of labs, X-rays, vitals, nurses, or even eye contact. Swollen joints, fevers, and abdominal pain have to be evaluated without a physical exam; some of my diabetic patients have started rationing their insulin; home-care arrangements for my elderly patients are splintering because necessary forms have gone missing. Some patients are holding up well; others are panicked and floundering. To a one, though, their foremost worry seems to be about us, the staff: they thank us, they bless us, they inquire after our families and admonish us to take care. All the patients with the coronavirus are being admitted to the general-medicine service, and at noon there’s a staff meeting. We learn that there are now almost thirty covid-19 patients in the I.C.U., and more than ninety on the wards. Attending physicians are being pulled from everywhere—clinic, cardiology, G.I., rheumatology, retirement. Senior residents from urology, orthopedics, surgery, and ophthalmology have been drafted to be interns on the medicine service. The staffing schedule looks like a nasa flowchart for the moon landing. Between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, another dozen patients have been intubated, and apparently there are only a few ventilators left in the hospital. A committee is being formed, we’re told, to start working on the practical aspects of “resource allocation”—a grim euphemism for deciding who will get a ventilator and, conversely, who might be extubated if their improvement stalls. Resource allocation is something we actually do all the time in medicine. Usually, though, it’s a low-stakes affair, measuring your patient’s situation against some abstract concept—clinical appropriateness, cost, availability, the risk of adverse outcomes. You aren’t measuring up against another flesh-and-blood patient in the next bed over. This is the first night I can’t sleep. On Friday, the magnolia tree next to the covid tent bursts into riotous blossom despite the chilly weather. Until now, the flowers have been delicate cups of pink and lavender, spaced along the spindly gray branches. Now they’ve abruptly reversed their concavity, spilling open into an unbroken blanket of defiant white. Normally, the inner workings of the hospital are invisible to doctors and nurses. We show up every day and the patients are there, the beds are there, the supplies are there, the lights turn on, the floors are clean. Now it’s as if we can feel the pulse of the hospital’s vasculature—the complex network of administrators, suppliers, maintenance workers, technicians, housekeepers, phone operators, transporters, and I.T. support staff that keep the clinical enterprise afloat. An influx of ventilators arrives that morning. New wards are opening up. Beds are materializing. The tent gets a sink with running water and an air-filtration system. It’s nothing short of miraculous. But the patients keep coming. On the news, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the U.K., is diagnosed with covid-19. On Twitter, an E.R. doctor says that he’s just had to intubate one of his colleagues. Every day, the rules of engagement reshuffle. Medical teams are reconfigured, treatment guidelines are revised, infection-control protocols are modified, sick-call procedures are altered, testing criteria change, P.P.E. rules evolve, pharmacy policies shift, a new ward opens, another I.C.U. is created, new C.D.C. recommendations are announced, another batch of research data is published, much of it not peer-reviewed. This Monday, March 30th, is no different—six new updates are announced at our morning meeting, and we dutifully recalibrate the way we’re going to practice medicine today, mentally jettisoning all of last week’s protocols. Our section chief, whose unpretentious competence and unflappable effervescence have made this ongoing cyclone feel manageable, usually conducts our morning meetings from a hospital conference room. Today, her babysitter has called out sick, and so she’s broadcasting from home. Over the video chat, strains of “Frozen” drift in from another room. Daily life feels vertiginous, and these morning check-ins have become vital ballast. The meetings are part war room and part family reunion: our now scattered colleagues log on from the wards and the I.C.U, from the covid tent and the medical clinic, from offices and exam rooms, from overnight call rooms, from home, from East Twenty-eighth Street as they rush to the hospital. One colleague on the wards describes feeling like a medical student again, learning absolutely everything from scratch. Another recounts adjusting a patient’s oxygen: the patient stopped her and asked, “Should you really be touching me?” One doctor is spending his evenings persuading phone companies to donate chargers for patients whisked here by ambulance without time to pack. A chief resident is training medical students to call patients’ families with daily updates. Someone is working from home on depositions for patients who were applying for political asylum when the pandemic hit. Someone else is single-handedly insuring that every homeless patient with the coronavirus gets a place to isolate. Another colleague is coördinating follow-up care for the waves of covid-19 patients discharged from the hospital. Yet another is tackling the avalanche of studies about hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab, steadily synthesizing the otherwise dizzying data for us. There’s an unspoken recognition of how oddly fortunate we are. In this quarantine culture of aimless boredom, we have a fraternity of purpose. In a world now riven by isolation and loneliness, we have one another. Before the pandemic, staff meetings were modestly attended. Now they are standing room only. The next day, March 31st, Bellevue begins distributing masks for the whole staff to wear all day, even when not involved in patient care. This is so we don’t infect one another. There are now over forty thousand cases in New York City; the death toll has passed a thousand. In the tent, I triage a patient who’s been diverted from the overwhelmed E.R. I watch him plod unsteadily toward us. It’s another chilly day, with temperatures in the low forties, but he is overdressed even for this, wearing sweatpants over jeans and an overcoat over a parka over a hoodie. He tells me that he’s been feeling tired for the past two months. He’s been living in Penn Station, having long since lost touch with his family. When I ask him how long he’s been smoking, he mumbles, “Four years.” When I ask him how long he’s been drinking, he says, “Four years.” Heroin? “Four years.” I stop my rundown of medical questions and lean forward. “What happened four years ago?” I ask. “I got my heart broken,” he says. We sit in silence, the March wind chiselling around us. His oxygen saturation is ninety-five per cent, but when we walk him along the garden path it plummets into the low eighties; he has to be admitted to the hospital. I swab his nasopharynx for the coronavirus, but I perform the rest of the physical exam, too. The bulbous clubbing of his fingernail beds could indicate chronic pulmonary disease or possibly lung cancer. Distant heart sounds could reflect pericardial effusion—fluid accumulating around the heart. Edematous legs swollen with interstitial fluid could mean heart failure, or liver failure, or kidney failure. These other diseases still exist. After work I head up First Avenue. Two blocks north of Bellevue is the chief medical examiner’s office. As a first-year medical student, I’d had nightmares for weeks after visiting the infamous “Evidence Room” on the fifth floor, where a century’s worth of New York’s gruesome oddities—the bone crushers used by serial killers, the severed factory workers’ fingers found in cans of ill-prepared food—sit on display. As I pass by now, I see that a C.M.E. van has blocked off traffic to East Thirtieth Street. I turn down the now silent block toward F.D.R. Drive. Four construction workers are slivering planks of fresh plywood over a sawhorse. Through the open back of their truck, I can see what look like triple-level bunks, constructed from raw two-by-fours. At the end of the block, where Bellevue faces the East River, I count eleven trailers. They are lined up with military precision. They occupy the same site as the 9/11 tent, the cavernous white structure that served as an extension of the C.M.E.’s office for a decade, safeguarding the remains that awaited identification. Kalustyan’s—the venerable purveyor of Middle Eastern and Indian food on Lexington Avenue—is joining its neighbors on lockdown, but doesn’t want its fresh food to go to waste. On Thursday, the restaurant loads up cartons with hummus, mujadara, za’atar, ful, t’hina, and zhoug, plus enough pita for a minor caliphate, and I lug it all to Bellevue. It’s oddly comforting to watch my colleagues scarf down the food. Two years ago, almost to the day, my Yemenite-Israeli father passed away. Ful and zhoug were his elixirs, and he slathered them on anything that didn’t move. “They ward off bacteria,” he swore to me. I load up my pita—it can’t hurt. As of Monday, April 6th, the coronavirus-case count in New York City is almost a hundred thousand. The inpatient count at Bellevue has pushed past three hundred. Our partner city hospitals—Lincoln, Jacobi, Elmhurst—are being pummelled even harder. Bellevue has begun taking patients from them, at first in handfuls and then in batches of thirty or forty; almost six hundred patients make their way across the East River to Bellevue, a staggering feat of coördination. Carpenters and engineers have been working their way through the I.C.U. floor, converting all the rooms into the negative-pressure spaces required to keep highly contagious pathogens out of circulation. As soon as the workers exit a room, an intubated patient is wheeled in behind them—and so it goes, for every one of the fifty-four rooms. The coronavirus has now taken over the entire I.C.U. It’s as if all the other calamities—heart attacks, strokes, traumas, appendicitis—have evanesced on cue. A flash mob in reverse. The I.C.U. service has spread well beyond its own floor, usurping two sections of the E.R., the endoscopy suite, the post-op units, plus another surgical ward. Walking through the E.R. that evening, I notice that every patient is hooked up to a different model of ventilator, each with its own arrangement of buttons, dials, and touch screens. These are the ventilators that averted our harrowingly close call two weeks ago. The basics are the same, but operating them is like being saddled with ten different TV remote controls. I’m helping one of the nurses when a patient erupts into a cytokine storm—a runaway immune-system response, resulting in life-threatening inflammation. She’s already intubated, sedated, and paralyzed, but her temperature has started to jump the rails: first it’s 103.8, then 104.5, then 105.3. Three of us gingerly roll her to one side and attempt to slide an electric cooling blanket beneath her, without dislodging her breathing tube, arterial line, cardiac monitors, or I.V. drips. Her temperature hits 106.1. We cram specimen bags with ice as quickly as we can, tucking them into her armpits, under her neck, and between her legs. They turn to water almost on contact. Her temperature is now 106.9, and her pulse has soared to a hundred and seventy. Someone says that there’s a cooling tub, but no one knows where it is. One nurse is from the surgery department. The other is from Ohio. The patient’s temperature climbs to 107.6, then 108.2. I’ve never seen a temperature this high in my life. It hits 108.8, and I worry that she’ll start seizing. A veteran E.R. nurse materializes like a demigod, lugging three bulging trash bags of ice, procured from who knows where. We heave the bags up over the bed rails, and they buckle across the contours of her body, the ice cubes sloshing and clanking. Slowly, slowly the mercury eases down, settling at 103.1. With all the commotion, the patient’s arterial line has been dislodged from her right wrist; she now needs one on the left. But the subcutaneous tissue of her arm has swollen up on either side of her hospital I.D. band. Slender friendship bracelets—beaded and braided in an assortment of colors—carve parallel lines into her skin. As the I.C.U. resident preps the boggy wrist with antiseptic, I pull scissors from a suture kit and snip off each bracelet in turn. The resident and I catch eyes over our masks: “It’s like the last bit of her,” she murmurs. I put the bracelets in a specimen bag and crouch down to the base of the stretcher, where patient belongings are stored. For a moment, I contemplate slipping the bag into my pocket. Something like this could so easily disappear in the general tumult—knocked over, stepped on, slipped on, swept up. But it’s not my place to take it, even if to protect it. I bury the bag as deeply as I can within her clothing and hope for the best. On Thursday, April 9th, I spend the morning rounding with the palliative-care team in the I.C.U. Usually, they follow a dozen or so patients suffering from the standard gamut of terminal illnesses: cancer, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure. But today there are more than sixty-five patients on the list, and just about only one diagnosis. Sunshine cascades through the generous windows of the I.C.U., but the rays seem to flounder once in the rooms—an aubade without an audience. A few glass doors are distinguished by a hastily taped-up E.K.G. or a phone number scrawled in black marker. Otherwise, there is a wearying sameness as we make our way around the unit. The patients are starkly sedated, chemically paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. They seem entirely without agency. In truth, so do we: we set up ventilators, fluids, vasopressors, and the crapshoot antiviral drug of the day, and then stand back and wait. The churn of physiology that will determine the patients’ outcomes is shrouded within their unnaturally still bodies while we watch from behind the glass. Afterward, I hole up in my office to tackle my mountain of phone calls. I’ve known most of my twelve hundred patients for years, a few even since I was an intern at Bellevue. Ten calls in, I decide to check on a woman whose fragile diabetes often flies out of control. She’s in her mid-sixties, but slim and scampery as a teen-ager. Last year, she fell into a severe depression. She was unrecognizable—lethargic, sobbing, unable to find a reason to live. But her family was dogged, as was her psychiatric team, and toward the end of November the pall had lifted. Two months ago, she’d bustled into my office as bright as a freshly tuned violin, her ebullient Spanish galloping faster than my brain could translate. Slam-dunk success stories like this are rare in primary care, and I was effusive in her chart. “Incredible improvement of mood! Back to cheerful, happy baseline,” I’d written. Her daughter answers the phone, and I launch right into my blood-sugar queries. But she cuts me off. She tells me that her mother is dead—killed by the coronavirus three days ago. My half-spoken insulin question jams in my throat. I suddenly understand how Houdini must have felt, punched in the gut before he had the chance to clench his muscles. We’re all restless when we’re away from the hospital. All weekend I’m home, feeling fidgety, continually logging in to the E.M.R.—the electronic-medical-records system. I’m checking on patients from the E.R., following up on tests from the tent, and keeping tabs on my regular patients, many of whom are suffering from covid-19 at home or caring for someone with it. Every day, I’ve been checking on the patient whose temperature spiked. I’m sitting at my kitchen table on Saturday afternoon when I see the expiration note in the E.M.R., documenting her time of death. My window is open, and the newly emboldened birds are keeping up their sylvan racket. On the news, it’s announced that the U.S. has just surpassed Italy as the global leader in coronavirus deaths. There are more than five thousand dead in New York City alone, but somehow I can think only about the bracelets. Did anyone find them under the stretcher? Did someone give them to her family? Or was the bag subsumed into the mass of alcohol pads, syringe caps, and gauze that the housekeeping team is heroically keeping at bay . . . . On Tuesday, April 14th, New York City alters the way it tabulates coronavirus deaths. Until now, it has included only patients who’ve tested positive. But we all know that the test is insufficiently sensitive as well as insufficiently available. The new tally includes patients with “presumed” covid-19. In one fell swoop, more than thirty-seven hundred New Yorkers are added to the rolls. The death count now tops ten thousand. At 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, April 15th, a helicopter hovers over Bellevue, its rotors thudding ominously. The sound of helicopters has always unsettled me. Even the corporate helicopters that touch down at the Thirty-fourth Street heliport burrow into my chest. Choppers! Maybe I watched too much “m*a*s*h” as a kid. By 7 a.m., the helicopter is gone. Its provenance remains a mystery. I spend the morning on the wards with a colleague who normally practices psychiatry and addiction medicine. We’re rounding with a dermatology resident, a senior orthopedic resident, and a hastily graduated medical student all acting as medicine interns, plus one regular medical resident and a trio of imported nurse practitioners with accents ranging from deep Southern drawl to Midwestern flat—the typical pastiche that constitutes a medical team these days. As we work our way through the patient roster, the P.A. system issues a “rapid response” announcement. Pre-covid, rapids could signify any sort of acute clinical deterioration: unstable arrhythmia, altered neurologic status, sepsis. Now, a rapid response means only one thing—someone is getting intubated and going to the I.C.U. A few minutes later, the P.A. calls another rapid, and then another, and another. There are four in the space of an hour. The relentlessness of the rapid responses is wearing down the staff, so the hospital has begun complementing them with thirty-second clips of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’ ” whenever there is good news—an extubation, a discharge, or a transfer out of the I.C.U. But this morning there is no eighties rock to be heard. We gown up to see two patients sharing a room. In Bed 1 is a middle-aged Bengali woman who’s just been transferred from an overloaded hospital in Queens. With high-flow oxygen streaming into her nose, she is already feeling much better; her oxygen saturation is comfortably in the nineties. Treating other pulmonary ailments—asthma, pneumonia, emphysema, congestive heart failure—you’re generally on safe ground once your patient has been pulled back from the precipice. Not so with covid-19. No matter how much the vital signs stabilize, or how comfortably conversational the patient seems, there is always the dreaded zone of day six through day ten. Up to a third of patients crash—even young healthy ones—and so, even though this patient looks good, no one is contemplating discharge. “All I want to do is go to the bathroom,” she begs. “The real bathroom.” It’s only four paces away, but we can’t risk detaching her oxygen, even briefly. We lug over a chair, place a bedpan, and pull the curtain. In Bed 2 is a diminutive Dominican woman, her heavily corrugated face buried within a shawl of bunched sheets. Last night, the previous occupant of Bed 1 coded. At the best of times, codes are chaotic, traumatic affairs; a quick-thinking nurse will usually hustle a roommate out of the room. But now every patient is an infectious risk, so no one can be moved. The woman in Bed 2, therefore, was a hostage, witness to an apocalyptic ending not five feet from her bed. “Dios mío,” she says, in a dry croak, when I ask how she is doing. All the patients seem cripplingly dehydrated, no matter how many litres of fluid we pump into their veins. She grasps my hand, and I can feel her friable, papery skin, even through my gloves. In the good old days, such as they were, Bellevue had a busy staff cafeteria on one of the upper floors. Budget cuts have since diminished it to a cluster of vending machines and microwaves. I’m not nostalgic, though, since, back then, the cafeteria sat next to the ward where end-stage aids patients spent their final days. I weathered the grimmest, bleakest moments of my medical career on that floor. I mostly avoid it, except when I have to change from the express to the local elevators. Now the space next to the cafeteria has been repurposed as a round-the-clock N95 fit-testing station, thrumming with staff members getting sprayed with aspartame. At 6:30 p.m. on Friday, April 17th, we trudge past them, straight to the cavernous room at the back. It’s packed with people, all masked, all in scrubs. The tables are draped in royal blue, accented with silver runners. A sea of electric candles lends a devotional air to an otherwise industrial space. Everyone is silent. In early March, when the coronavirus was just peeking over the horizon, a co-worker had commented offhandedly that our colleagues could become our patients. Many staff did indeed contract the coronavirus, but, mostly, cases were mild. No longer. “In Memoriam,” the banner reads. “Ernesto DeLeon, RN: July 23, 1959–April 13, 2020.” Audie, as everyone called him, was a Bellevue lifer, a quiet presence who clocked in thirty years on staff. As a head nurse, he was an anchor in the tumult of the telemetry unit, where patients could receive cardiac monitoring without having to be admitted to the I.C.U. But then Audie himself had to be admitted to the I.C.U., where he was cared for by his own colleagues. After the eulogies, a medical resident takes up her violin to play “Amazing Grace”; an E.N.T. resident contributes the vocals, his tenor undamped by his surgical mask. The quavering vibrato of the violin seems to mirror our inability to find an angle of repose. It’s a relief when the audience is invited to join in on the second verse. Somehow, an insistent fermata of sirens manages to slink through from the street. Singing with a mask is hard enough; singing while sobbing into your mask is impossible. A box of tissues makes the rounds, but it’s hard to mop our eyes without cross-contaminating the clean and dirty sides of our masks. In the awkward silence that follows the song, we make half-hearted attempts to social-distance. At some point, it becomes a losing proposition. “Fuck it,” someone finally mutters, turning to hug a nursing supervisor. As the embraces begin to travel through the crowded room, we realize how long it’s been since anyone has hugged. Audie’s colleagues hand out blue ribbons to the staff. We file out after the service, pinning the ribbons onto our I.D. cards, past the N95 fit-testing station, still bustling. In mid-April, the sprint that began in March—the race to open I.C.U. beds, conjure up more medicine teams, recruit additional nurses—gives way to a sustained slog of sickness. The morning meetings no longer offer daily adjustments to medical protocol. The excitement of building the airplane while flying it has waned. It’s just, “Keep doing what you’re doing.” The total number of coronavirus patients in the hospital remains stuck in the three hundreds, edging close to four hundred on Easter Sunday. The medical I.C.U. service, which normally cares for a dozen patients, powers through these grueling days with as many as a hundred and ten patients. Rapid responses churn from the P.A. system, unceasing gut punches. This doesn’t feel like a peak or even a plateau; it’s more like an abyss. Then, in the third week of April, the total number of covid-19 patients eases below three hundred, and the I.C.U. census dips below a hundred. The boot seems to lift, if only slightly. What emerges isn’t relief, exactly, but a welter of fractured emotions. Up until this point, we’ve been urgent, focussed, determined. Now, in the waning days of April, it’s as though we’re suddenly seeing what is happening around us and to us. In hallway conversations, colleagues begin talking about anxieties and nightmares. Some people agonize about whether they’ve done enough; others berate themselves for putting their families at risk. Those who are rotated off duty feel uneasy about returning to civilian life. Family issues, shunted aside in the pandemic whirlwind, suddenly become visible—sandbars revealed when the tide goes out. Our apartments look like Chernobyl. We discover that our teens have fallen cripplingly behind in their remote schooling, that our young kids now rally to the other parent. Long-suffering spouses are bitter, tired of sublimating everything on behalf of the “health-care hero” who gets to escape the domestic dungeon every day. We discover colleagues who’ve been suffering in silence, edged with P.T.S.D.-like symptoms. Others, having decamped to hotels to protect their families, now find the separation more than they can bear. Amid the unveiled pain, we pause to take stock of the monumental achievement of our hospital, and all the hospitals in the city. Grousing about administration is in health-care workers’ DNA—it really did take two years to get a staff water cooler!—but the steadying hospital leadership, the rapid-fire mobilization, and the collective commitment we witnessed have awed even the most jaded of Bellevue lifers. And yet our pride is hung heavy with heartache. Fifteen thousand New Yorkers have died; two hundred thousand have fallen ill; so many of our patients are still suffering. Everyone knows someone who’s been affected. There’s no vaccine and no safe harbor in sight. By May, the deployments are largely over. Staff have settled back into their pre-pandemic roles (though many of us discover that we’ve consumed as much quarantine comfort food as everyone else, and can’t ditch our baggy scrubs for civilian garb). The Navy Medical Corps and the travelling nurses have gone home; the impromptu I.C.U.s have been dismantled; the rapid responses grow less frequent. Although the main I.C.U. is still filled with covid-19 patients—mostly chronic sufferers who will need long-term care—and there are still more than a hundred patients with the coronavirus on the medical floors, we now also see patients with chest pain, alcohol withdrawal, heart failure, cellulitis, urosepsis, and asthma. The main question now is what to do with the outpatient half of the hospital. How can we restart our huge clinic system without endangering our patients or ourselves? We’ve been doing telemedicine for weeks now. Will we ever return to the intimacy of direct patient care? In medicine, we’re primed to rush to emergencies, and covid-19 has been no different. The pandemic provided us a shared sense of purpose. But picking up the pieces offers no such piercing clarity. As I sit in my office, day after day, dialling one number after another, all I can think is, Is this what I really want to be? Some days, I can hardly muster the energy to pick up the phone. At the same time, I’m panicked that the other shoe is about to drop for every one of my twelve hundred patients. All of us seem to be suffering from this strange amalgam of malaise and mania. The lines between work and home are hopelessly blurred. Having sworn that I’d sooner mainline habañero peppers than spend nights and weekends logging on to the E.M.R., I find that I’m checking my messages like an addict. Pre-coronavirus, messages from patients were minor league: a refill of Lasix, a request for a derm appointment. Now they are cataclysmic. “There’s something growing in my breast.” “My father is delirious.” “There’s blood all over the toilet.” I call a patient who is squeaking by on his last thread of renal function. The fluid that his kidneys can no longer excrete is waterlogging his legs; he’s fallen twice this week. His potassium is reaching the cardiac-toxicity zone. Normally, I’d admit him to the hospital immediately, but he wouldn’t stand a chance against the coronavirus if he contracted it. In any case, he refuses to even entertain the possibility. I make phone calls to arrange for home phlebotomy and a visiting nurse, and then cross my fingers. I call another patient and learn that she was beaten up by a relative over the weekend; I get on the phone to social work and contact legal services, and draft letters for an order of protection. Another patient leaves an anodyne message requesting medication refills. When I call back, she’s huffing with pain. She had surgery at another hospital; her post-op check was fine, but now she’s doubled over in agony. I tell her to go straight to the E.R., but she flatly refuses—her terror about the coronavirus is implacable. I plead with her. I beg her. By 8 p.m., she’s in the operating room, getting an intra-abdominal abscess drained. Primary care during covid-19 is its own spiralling crisis, with no one working to flatten the curve. By June, there are only about a dozen coronavirus patients left in the I.C.U., and fifty or so on the wards. In the courtyard, the covid tent is bustling, now part of New York City’s growing test-and-trace effort. The trees around it have gone generic green, with no hint of their springtime efflorescence. It’s almost jarring to see so many ordinary folks in our midst, clad in the alien attire of shorts and tank tops. They wait, almost reverently, on the socially distanced line to register. The city is alive with protest—the lockdown has given way to outrage after George Floyd’s murder. In the hospital, we’ve seen firsthand how the coronavirus devastates Black and brown patients disproportionately. The staff streams out onto First Avenue for the demonstrations, carrying signs: “White Coats for Black Lives.” The pandemic unfolds into the summer and drags us, exhausted, into the fall. New York City, parched and panting, watches with horror as the rest of the country marches straight into the hellhole from which we’ve just extricated ourselves. We’d taken a bullet for our country—hadn’t we?—but obviously to no avail. Political chaos, science-denial, absence of leadership, and American “exceptionalism” seem impervious to the lessons we’ve so painfully learned. We approach, and then pass, the bleak milestone of two hundred thousand American deaths. It’s as though the entirety of Salt Lake City has been wiped off the map. Just beyond the covid tent, which now tests upwards of five hundred New Yorkers every day, a plaque in the courtyard commemorates the seven hospital staff members who died of covid-19. In normal times, I try to attend my patients’ funerals, but this is impossible now. I call instead, tune into Zoom, send condolence cards. For each of my patients, I wrestle with the same question: “Did this have to be?” Ithink back to that warm day in mid-June, when, for the first time, a patient of mine returned to Bellevue for an old-fashioned check-up. In order to remain six feet apart in my six-foot exam room, I backed up against the door, and she wedged in next to the sink at the far wall. We couldn’t hug hello, as we’d normally do, but I was relieved to hear that she’d come through the pandemic O.K. She hadn’t got sick, although plenty of her friends and family had. She’d attended her share of Zoom funerals. We doctors had been instructed to avoid physical exams, but my patient has a severe heart disease, so I couldn’t skip it. The bottom edge of my plastic face shield scratched her shoulder as I slipped the bell of my stethoscope onto her chest. The ramped-up ventilation system dampened the sound, but it was there—the unflagging cadence that I’d taken for granted in the thousands of physical exams I’ve done over the years. I listened longer than I needed to. That heartbeat. I just needed to hear it. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Who Should Get Bailed Out in the Coronavirus Economy?,8630,"According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the new Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to provide emergency funding for small businesses that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis, is working well. At a White House briefing on Tuesday, he said that the banks participating in the program, which is overseen by the Small Business Administration, have already distributed loans to more than a million companies that have ten or fewer employees. A summary report from the Treasury Department showed that the average size of the P.P.P. loans, which recipient businesses don’t have to repay if they use the money to keep workers on their payroll, has been two hundred and six thousand dollars. “We’re pleased with the success of this program and how quickly this got up operationally,” Mnuchin said. By the end of last week, the P.P.P. had already exhausted the three hundred and forty billion dollars that Congress set aside for it in the $2.2 trillion cares Act, which Donald Trump signed at the end of March. On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that allots another three hundred and ten billion dollars to the small-business program. But the P.P.P. is also embroiled in controversy. In recent days, a number of small firms have filed lawsuits against banks, claiming lenders have favored their bigger customers and excluded many of the businesses that the program was intended to help. It has also emerged that a number of large companies, including the Shake Shack and Potbelly restaurant chains, exploited a carve-out to obtain loans through the P.P.P. After widespread complaints, Shake Shack announced that it would repay the ten million dollars it received. At Tuesday’s briefing, Mnuchin said he would be asking other companies to follow suit, and he insisted, “We want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that need it.” These complaints illuminate the challenges of trying to create a huge economic-assistance program on the fly, particularly one that is administered through third parties—banks—that have their own financial interests and incentives. (Other governments, including those in the United Kingdom and Denmark, are distributing wage subsidies directly to businesses.) But the anger over the P.P.P. rollout also raises the issue of fairness, which is going to loom ever larger as the human and economic toll from the pandemic mounts. Who should get bailed out? And who shouldn’t? It isn’t just small businesses that are struggling to get financial help. In Florida alone, according to an analysis by the Associated Press, about six hundred and fifty thousand people have applied for unemployment benefits since mid-March, but only thirty-three thousand and six hundred have received checks. As the number of applications has surged, Florida’s Department of Labor has been overwhelmed. Unable to file claims online, some people have defied stay-at-home orders to line up at sites issuing paper forms, putting their health at risk. In other parts of the country, people who have been laid off or furloughed are having similar difficulties. With many economists predicting that the unemployment rate will rise to as high as twenty per cent in the coming months, the government’s failure to quickly address this problem will create enormous hardship. Yet Republicans in the Senate refused to include any additional financial aid for the states in the new funding package. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said that helping the states could be taken up in another stimulus bill, but he also expressed concern about the amount of money the federal government is spending. On Wednesday, McConnell said he wanted to hit the “Pause button” on any plans for state aid, and his office derided the idea as a “blue-state bailout.” Yet there is no shortage of money to bail out large corporations. The cares Act set aside about fifty billion dollars in grants and loans to rescue the airline industry, and on Monday the Treasury Department said it had disbursed $2.9 billion in loans to six major airlines, including American, Delta, and United. ( The Department said that it expected five more airlines to participate in its Payroll Support Program (not to be confused with the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses) and that it would also “make additional payments to approved applicants on a rolling basis.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold The virus has devastated the airlines’ revenues, of course, and the Treasury imposed a number of conditions for the loans, including requiring recipients to maintain payrolls, limit executive compensation, suspend dividend payments, and grant stock warrants to the government. But the precise terms of the bailout are still murky. And there is a basic question of whether the airlines, and their top executives, deserve to be rescued in this fashion. Before the pandemic hit, the airlines enjoyed years of profitability. Rather than setting aside reserves for a rainy day, many C.E.O.s spent vast sums buying back their own airlines’ stocks to boost their prices and, not coincidentally, the value of their often stock-based pay packages. In a Twitter post on Tuesday, Robert Reich, the Berkeley professor who served as Labor Secretary in the Clinton Administration, pointed out that the “$50 billion taxpayers have spent bailing out the airline industry almost equals the $48 billion the airlines spent buying back their shares of stock since 2010.” The airline bailout is but one of many to come. In addition to rescuing the airline industry and others deemed critical to national security, the cares Act created a bailout fund for hospitals and health-care providers, including for-profit ones. After the new spending bill is enacted, this fund will total a hundred and seventy-five billion dollars. On Tuesday, Axios’s Bob Herman reported that HCA Healthcare, a publicly traded company that runs a vast network of hospitals and medical centers, has received seven hundred million dollars in emergency funding that it doesn’t have to repay. There’s more money coming for corporate America—a great deal more. In a provision that hasn’t received as much attention as others, the cares Act also set aside four hundred and fifty-four billion dollars to backstop some new lending facilities at the Fed, including one that will extend credit to medium-sized corporations that have between five hundred and ten thousand employees. The Fed hasn’t turned on the new money spigot yet. But it’s reportedly finalizing the details of the new program. Is all of this a fair and proper use of taxpayers’ money? It’s hard to know. Although the cares Act provided for a system of oversight by an independent inspector general and two new committees, to be appointed by Congress, this system isn’t up and running. “Right now, you have nothing,” Neil Barofsky, a New York lawyer who served as the inspector general of the seven-hundred-billion-dollar tarp fund that Congress established during the financial crisis of 2008, told MarketWatch. “You have no congressional oversight committee, because it doesn’t have a chairperson. You have no special inspector general, because he’s not been confirmed. And you have no active Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, because it’s leaderless.” About all we do have is the knowledge that the government is distributing a great deal of money. And yet many millions of Americans are still facing terrible hardship. That is a combustible combination. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Coronavirus Pandemic’s Wider Health-Care Crisis,15556,"Gwen Darien is a three-time cancer survivor. When she was thirty-five, she was diagnosed with lymphoma; in her fifties, she was treated for breast cancer; two years ago, she learned that she had endometrial cancer. With curly black hair and an indomitable personality, she embodies vibrancy, courage, and resilience. Even so, last month, when she received a call from her doctor’s office about an upcoming visit, she decided to postpone it indefinitely. “I was very unnerved,” she told me. “I thought about all the risks. First, I’d have to get transportation—Uber or train or subway. Then I’d have to walk into the doctor’s office, near a hospital with covid-19 patients. Then I’d have to be in the office with other people, even if they are socially distanced. I’d much rather just wait.” During the pandemic, many patients and physicians have felt this kind of hesitation. Some people with chronic illnesses, fearful of entering a medical setting or even venturing outside, have stopped seeing doctors altogether. Others have tried to make appointments but found clinics closed and routine care suspended. At many hospitals, non-urgent or “elective” care has been postponed for months. It’s difficult to say for sure what the effects of such postponements have been and will be. But statistics show that, across the United States, so-called excess deaths—deaths beyond those that are historically typical—have surged. Although many of these deaths can be attributed to covid-19, delayed or cancelled care is probably a contributing factor, too. An analysis of death certificates shows that a fifth of the twenty-four thousand excess deaths that occurred in New York City between March 11th and May 2nd were caused by factors other than covid-19; according to a study currently in pre-publication review, hospitals saw a thirty-eight-per-cent drop in serious heart-attack cases in March alone, suggesting that even people with acute, life-threatening illnesses have been avoiding medical visits. (The American College of Cardiology has gone so far as to issue a statement urging people to seek medical attention if they’re having cardiac symptoms.) A nationwide survey conducted in April found that a quarter of cancer patients receiving active treatment had seen their care delayed. Ultimately, it’s not just people with covid-19 who are suffering; those with other illnesses are affected by the pandemic, too. The coronavirus crisis itself continues to deepen. Although the first peak has passed in a few major cities, cases have held steady in many parts of the country and are rising in twenty-six states. North Carolina saw its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases on June 12th; Florida, Arizona, and Texas saw record spikes this week. Some of this growth reflects increased testing, but, in many places, deaths caused by the virus are also rising—a sign that the spike is real and not a statistical artefact. The U.S. still records more than thirty thousand new cases each day; according to projections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the national death toll could reach a hundred and forty thousand by the Fourth of July; the country’s public-health response remains scattershot, with grossly inadequate testing and contact tracing; and mass protests and planned reopenings, which are continuing despite the risks, have given the virus new breathing room. America as a whole seems to have entered a long viral plateau. The pandemic is now a rolling collection of mini-epidemics that surge and subside as the virus bobs and weaves its way across the country. It will be a long time before life returns to normal. The persistence of the pandemic is creating serious challenges, many of them unforeseen, for the health-care system. Even before the pandemic, many hospitals were in precarious financial condition: in 2018, the average hospital had a two-per-cent operating margin and less than two months of cash on hand; the situation was worse for rural hospitals, a fifth of which were already at risk of closing due to financial problems. Having lost billions of dollars in revenue, hospitals must now figure out how to reintroduce routine care while keeping patients safe and preparing for possible surges of covid-19. (As my colleague Atul Gawande has written, it is possible for hospitals to reopen without becoming vectors for the virus; doing so, however, requires time, resources, and personnel.) Hospitals in Massachusetts are losing $1.4 billion in revenue per month, and project total losses of five billion dollars by the end of July. The Mayo Clinic alone, which runs twenty-three hospitals nationwide, is set to lose three billion dollars this year. The American Hospital Association estimates that, altogether, U.S. hospitals are bleeding fifty billion dollars a month during the pandemic. The hundreds of thousands of doctors in independent practice have more limited capital reserves, and many may be forced to shutter their operations or merge them with others. In the context of the economy as a whole, these losses are substantial. According to the Department of Commerce, the American economy shrank by nearly five per cent in the first quarter of 2020. Nearly half of this change—the biggest single-quarter drop since the Great Recession—had to do with reductions in health care. In a few months’ time, the coronavirus has accomplished what lawmakers have been trying to do for decades: by flattening the curve of infection, we have bent the curve of health-care spending. But it’s been bent haphazardly, by the hurried cancellation or postponement of colonoscopies and mammograms, hip replacements and cataract surgeries, stress tests and root canals—and those unsustainable choices will have real consequences for the health of patients. As the virus continues to spread, the clinical damage will almost certainly compound. It’s vitally important, therefore—both for the health of individuals and of the system as a whole—for doctors to resume seeing patients who don’t have covid-19. In April, medical organizations, including the American Hospital Association, began releasing road maps for the resumption of regular care; since then, governors have announced various protocols in their own states. The details vary, but the basic principles are the same: wait for a sustained reduction in covid-19 cases; insure an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.); test constantly; and plan to throttle back on the expansion of services if the virus surges again. The more fine-grained question, of exactly which procedures should be prioritized and which delayed, is usually left unanswered. Vivek Prachand, a surgeon at the University of Chicago, has been thinking about this problem since early March, when hospitals first started grappling with how to rank procedures in terms of their clinical urgency. Often, he told me, the decisions were being made by individual physicians or small committees within hospitals. “It was really just surgeons saying, ‘O.K., go ahead,’ or, ‘No, we need to hold off,’ ” he said. “You can imagine the emotional and ethical challenges of being in that position.” He and his colleagues have developed a rubric to help guide such decisions during the pandemic, which they call the Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive System, or ments. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Prachand dislikes referring to care as “elective,” because the term suggests that procedures are optional or unnecessary; really, elective care is just care that can be scheduled. (Setting a broken arm is “urgent” care; brain surgery, most of the time, isn’t.) To help set the schedule, the ments protocol asks three kinds of questions. First, it assesses procedural factors, such as how long the surgery will take, how many clinicians will be exposed, how much P.P.E. will be used, and how likely the patient is to be intubated or require a prolonged stay in the hospital. Second, it grades the dangers presented by the problems the surgery hopes to solve, asking how bad the condition will get if doctors wait, and whether there are any effective non-surgical remedies. Finally, it sizes up how much viral risk the operation poses to the patient. Is she immunosuppressed? Does she have an underlying lung disease? What are the chances that she’s already been exposed to the virus? The answers to all of these questions are combined into a formula that yields a recommendation about when the team should proceed. After Prachand published the scoring system, it was adopted by other departments in his hospital. He received e-mail inquiries from American hospitals, and from places as far afield as London, Gibraltar, and South Africa. The American Hospital Association included the system in its statement about how to reopen. In theory, the tool can be used at any time during the pandemic: during a coronavirus spike, on a plateau, or when the virus is quiescent. Surgeons simply adjust the “score threshold” at which they are willing to operate. ments holds a broader lesson for reopenings generally. It’s important to have a decision-making system that’s transparent, that anyone can understand, and that takes into account all of the relevant factors. Without such a system, those in charge could be seen as acting arbitrarily, and consumers will feel hesitation and fear. “This is meant to reassure patients, clinicians, and hospital leaders that the choices we’re making have some basis other than our gut feelings,” Prachand said. “It’s really a microcosm of what we need to do to open the economy. If we do it in a way that makes sense to people, that’s transparent, that’s dynamically adjustable, the public can feel confident that we know what we’re doing.” Smaller, independent medical practices face a different sort of problem: they must resolve many practical issues for themselves while staying solvent. Ripley Hollister, a native Californian with an easygoing drawl and an independent streak, runs a five-clinician family-medicine practice in Colorado Springs. On March 17th, within hours of the announcement that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be significantly increasing its reimbursements for telemedicine, he began seeing patients via videoconference. (In the past, Medicare paid for telemedicine only if patients lived in a rural area, or if they were in a medical facility when they received the service—an odd requirement that undermined the point of virtual care.) Hollister, who’s been in practice for more than thirty years, had never done a virtual visit before the pandemic; when we spoke, about two-thirds of his practice had gone remote. “I have millennials who work for me,” he explained. Yul Ejnes, a primary-care doctor in Rhode Island, told me in May that he had not seen a patient face-to-face in two months. “My stethoscope has been very lonely,” he said. As he contemplated moving back to in-person visits—he recently started seeing patients again on a trial basis—his chief concern was the waiting area. “The waiting room was a problem even before covid-19,” he told me. “You’d have twenty-five people sitting next to each other. Some of them were there for a flu shot, others were there with the flu—throw in coronavirus and that setting is totally unacceptable.” His office has been doing its research. “We’re borrowing from the airlines. We’ll have online check-in. We’re borrowing from restaurants—wait outside and we’ll text you when your exam room is ready. We’re going to experiment with things like dedicated hours for sick visits and other times for well visits. Some futuristic practices probably already do this stuff, but we’re an old-school office, and this is new for us.” These success stories are heartening—but many other practices, even very successful ones, are struggling. Gary Price, a surgeon in solo practice in Guilford, Connecticut, employs seven people; when we spoke last month, I asked him what proportion of his usual patient volume he’d been seeing. “Somewhere between zero and one per cent,” he said. As a surgeon, Price cannot pivot to telemedicine. During the pandemic, he has performed a few minor surgeries—treating a three-year-old with a facial laceration, for example, and an older patient with a cancerous ulcer of the scalp. “The complete absence of income has forced me to consider, for the first time, a scenario in which my practice might not survive,” he said. His patients are trickling back, but the Paycheck Protection Program—the part of the cares Act passed by Congress that offers forgivable loans to help small businesses keep employees on payroll—was all that kept his practice afloat. Of the ten major flu pandemics since the late eighteen-nineties, seven had a second, deadly peak within a year of the first. Compared to the flu, the coronavirus appears to be harder to contain: it has a longer incubation period, more asymptomatic infections, and a higher reproduction rate. On May 28th, the United States reached a sombre milestone: a hundred thousand covid-19 deaths. In the days since, twenty-two thousand more people have died. And yet the virus’s harm extends to individuals whose lungs it never reaches, and who aren’t included in those grim totals: patients with diabetes, depression, cancer, and high blood pressure; people suffering heart attacks and strokes; families who can’t hold their dying loved ones, and the nurses who must hold the phones through which people say goodbye. There are doctors who can’t keep their covid-19 patients alive, and others who can’t keep their practices open. Even before the pandemic, American health care was in trouble. Although it is the most expensive system in the world, with a cost roughly equivalent to Germany’s G.D.P., it has delivered variable quality, produced mediocre outcomes, and left millions of people behind. Now the coronavirus has shaken its unsteady foundation, siphoning attention and resources away from patients who need other types of care. We tend to follow the virus’s toll narrowly—cases, hospitalizations, deaths—but the damage to public health is also vast, and the longer the pandemic persists, the larger it will grow. Children go unvaccinated; blood pressure is left uncontrolled; cancer survivors miss their checkups. The extent of the collateral damage won’t be known for years, if ever. But it’s clear that mitigating the harm starts by getting the virus under control. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Students Left Behind by Remote Learning,0,
Can Greek Tragedy Get Us Through the Pandemic?,47129,"“Children of Thebes, why are you here?” Oscar Isaac asked. His face filled the monitor on my dining table. (It was my partner’s turn to use the desk.) We were a couple of months into lockdown, just past seven in the evening, and a few straggling cheers for essential workers came in through the window. Isaac was looking smoldery with a quarantine beard, a gold chain, an Airpod, and a black T-shirt. His display name was set to “Oedipus.” Isaac was one of several famous actors performing Sophocles’ “Oedipus the King” from their homes, in the first virtual performance by Theater of War Productions: a group that got its start in 2008, staging Sophocles’ “Ajax” and “Philoctetes” for U.S. military audiences and, beginning in 2009, on military installations around the world, including in Kuwait, Qatar, and Guantánamo Bay, with a focus on combat trauma. After each dramatic reading, a panel made up of people in active service, veterans, military spouses, and/or psychiatrists would describe how the play resonated with their experiences of war, before opening up the discussion to the audience. Since its founding, Theater of War Productions has addressed different kinds of trauma. It has produced Euripides’ “The Bacchae” in rural communities affected by the opioid crisis, “The Madness of Heracles” in neighborhoods afflicted by gun violence and gang wars, and Aeschylus’ “Prometheus Bound” in prisons. “Antigone in Ferguson,” which focusses on crises between communities and law enforcement, was motivated by an analogy between Oedipus’ son’s unburied body and that of Michael Brown, left on the street for roughly four hours after Brown was killed by police; it was originally performed at Michael Brown’s high school. Now, with trauma roving the globe more contagiously than ever, Theater of War Productions had traded its site-specific approach for Zoom. The app was configured in a way I hadn’t seen before. There were no buttons to change between gallery and speaker view, which alternated seemingly by themselves. You were in a “meeting,” but one you were powerless to control, proceeding by itself, with the inexorability of fate. There was no way to view the other audience members, and not even the group’s founder and director, Bryan Doerries, knew how numerous they were. Later, Zoom told him that it had been fifteen thousand. This is roughly the seating capacity of the theatre of Dionysus, where “Oedipus the King” is believed to have premièred, around 429 B.C. Those viewers, like us, were in the middle of a pandemic: in their case, the Plague of Athens. The original audience would have known Oedipus’ story from Greek mythology: how an oracle had predicted that Laius, the king of Thebes, would be killed by his own son, who would then sleep with his mother; how the queen, Jocasta, gave birth to a boy, and Laius pierced and bound the child’s ankles, and ordered a shepherd to leave him on a mountainside. The shepherd took pity on the maimed baby, Oedipus (“swollen foot”), and gave him to a Corinthian servant, who handed him off to the king and queen of Corinth, who raised him as their son. Years later, Oedipus killed Laius at a crossroads, without knowing who he was. Then he saved Thebes from a Sphinx, became the king of Thebes, had four children with Jocasta, and lived happily for many years. That’s where Sophocles picks up the story. Everyone would have known where things were headed—the truth would come out, and Oedipus would blind himself—but not how they would get there. How Sophocles got there was by drawing on contemporary events, on something that was in everyone’s mind, though it doesn’t appear in the original myth: a plague. In the opening scene, Thebes is in the grip of a terrible epidemic. Oedipus’ subjects come to the palace, imploring him to save the city, describing the scene of pestilence and panic, the screaming and the corpses in the street. Something about the way Isaac voiced Oedipus’ response—“Children. I am sorry. I know”—made me feel a kind of longing. It was a degree of compassion conspicuous by its absence in the current Administration. I never think of myself as someone who wants or needs “leadership,” yet I found myself thinking, We would be better off with Oedipus. “I would be a weak leader if I did not follow the gods’ orders,” Isaac continued, subverting the masculine norm of never asking for advice. He had already sent for the best information out there, from the Delphic Oracle. Soon, Oedipus’ brother-in-law, Creon—John Turturro, in a book-lined study—was doing his best to soft-pedal some weird news from Delphi. Apparently, the oracle said that the plague wouldn’t end until the people of Thebes expelled Laius’ killer: a person who was somehow still in the city, even though Laius had died many years earlier on an out-of-town trip. Oedipus called in the blind prophet, Tiresias, played by Jeffrey Wright, whose eyes were invisible behind a circular glare in his eyeglasses. Reading “Oedipus” in the past, I had always been exasperated by Tiresias, by his cryptic lamentations—“I will never reveal the riddles within me, or the evil in you”—and the way he seemed incapable of transmitting useful information. Spoken by a Black actor in America in 2020, the line made a sickening kind of sense. How do you tell the voice of power that the problem is in him, really baked in there, going back generations? “Feel free to spew all of your vitriol and rage in my direction,” Tiresias said, like someone who knew he was in for a tweetstorm. Oedipus accused Tiresias of treachery, calling out his disability. He cast suspicion on foreigners, and touted his own “wealth, power, unsurpassed skill.” He decried fake news: “It’s all a scam—you know nothing about interpreting birds.” He elaborated a deep-state scenario: Creon had “hatched a secret plan to expel me from office,” eliciting slanderous prophecies from supposedly disinterested agencies. It was, in short, a coup, designed to subvert the democratic will of the people of Thebes. Frances McDormand appeared next, in the role of Jocasta. Wearing no visible makeup, speaking from what looked like a cabin somewhere with wood-panelled walls, she resembled the ghost of some frontierswoman. I realized, when I saw her, that I had never tried to picture Jocasta: not her appearance, or her attitude. What was her deal? How had she felt about Laius maiming their baby? How had she felt about being offered as a bride to whomever defeated the Sphinx? What did she think of Oedipus when she met him? Did it never seem weird to her that he was her son’s age, and had horrible scars on his ankles? How did they get along, those two? VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? When you’re reading the play, you don’t have to answer such questions. You can entertain multiple possibilities without settling on one. But actors have to make decisions and stick to them. One decision that had been made in this case: Oedipus really liked her. “Since I have more respect for you, my dear, than anyone else in the world,” Isaac said, with such warmth in “my dear.” I was reminded of the fact that Euripides wrote a version of “Oedipus”—lost to posterity, like the majority of Greek tragedies—that some scholars suggest foregrounds the loving relationship between Oedipus and Jocasta. Jocasta’s immediate task was to defuse the potentially murderous argument between her husband and her brother. She took one of the few rhetorical angles available to a woman: why, such grown men ought to be ashamed of themselves, carrying on so when there was a plague going on. And yet, listening to the lines that McDormand chose to emphasize, it was clear that, in the guise of adult rationality and spreading peace, what she was actually doing was silencing and trivializing. “Come inside,” she said, “and we’ll settle this thing in private. And both of you quit making something out of nothing.” It was the voice of denial, and, through the play, you could hear it spread from character to character. By this point in the performance, I found myself spinning into a kind of cognitive overdrive, toggling between the text and the performance, between the historical context, the current context, and the “universal” themes. No matter how many times you see it pulled off, the magic trick is always a surprise: how a text that is hundreds or thousands of years old turns out to be about the thing that’s happening to you, however modern and unprecedented you thought it was. “Nothing can be foreseen,” Jocasta said, and I heard our President declaring, of the global pandemic about which he had been warned, repeatedly, in the direst possible terms, that “Nobody could have predicted something like this.” Then the voice of denial passed to Oedipus: “Why, my lady, should we ever again listen to the Pythian priestesses at Delphi or study the patterns of eagles and kingfishers shrieking loudly above us in the sky when they all foretold that I would one day kill my father? He is now dead in the ground and I am still here.” That one sounded like climate change, because it involved ignoring birds, but the sinister thing was precisely how the objects became interchangeable: global warming, gun violence, pandemics, sexual assault, genocide, the legacy of slavery. You’ve never really seen “Oedipus,” I found myself thinking, till you’ve seen it during a plague. The plague hadn’t really stood out to me on previous readings, yet it was the key to everything: the way the denial of the contagion reflected right back on the contagion of denial, its tendency to morph into “denialism.” I felt a new appreciation, too, for all the work the plague was doing to power the plot. It reprised the riddle of the Sphinx: Oedipus had to save the city again. It was a ticking time bomb: every moment that he didn’t solve the plague, the bodies were piling up, death-rich Hades was making off with more shades. And the ultimatum from Delphi—solve the murder, or the plague goes on—turned the myth of Oedipus into a whodunnit, with Oedipus himself as both detective and murderer. The plague arrived in Athens in 430 B.C., the second year of the Peloponnesian War. Athens was under siege from Sparta. Much of the rural population had, per instructions from the statesman Pericles, sought shelter within the city’s newly built fortifications, putting an extra burden on sanitation and housing. Perhaps as much as one-third of the Athenian population died, including Pericles and his two sons. Thucydides also got sick, but recovered, and was thus able to leave a vivid record, in his history of the Peloponnesian War, of not only the physical symptoms but the miasma of horror that swirled around the city: the confusion of the doctors, whose efforts to increase their knowledge about this unknown disease were generally rewarded by a slow and painful death; the absence of reliable advice, “for what helped one sufferer harmed another”; the apparent ineffectiveness of divine offerings and supplications, which led some people to become more religious, and others to embrace the most antisocial behavior; the collapse of the funeral rites and the desperation of the increasingly isolated survivors. And yet: evidence suggests that the theatre was still open. What does that mean? Was Thucydides exaggerating how bad it was? Did Athenians not believe in social distancing? Or were the city’s actors and playwrights considered to be essential workers? Increasing research has been devoted, in recent years, to the connection between ancient theatre and medical treatment, which often took place in the temple to Asklepios, the god of healing. There is archeological evidence that some such temples had an adjoining theatre, and some have argued that listening to a play may have been a part of treatment that also typically included going to sleep in the main hall, praying for gods to appear in their dreams and guide them toward a cure, a dream that priests and attendants would then interpret. When Athens got its own temple to Asklepios, it was built adjacent to the theatre of Dionysus—reportedly, with some involvement by Sophocles. I’ve been to the Asklepion in Pergamon, in present-day Turkey: an underground passage provides easy access between the theatre and the patients’ sleeping hall. According to Doerries, the acoustics in Athens were such that a person bedridden in the temple would still be able to hear every word spoken in the theatre. How differentiated was the function of the theatre from that of the clinic? The question might not have made that much sense at the time. Plato was born during the Plague of Athens, so he hadn’t yet gotten around to articulating some of the dichotomies—body versus soul, real versus ideal—without which we can now barely imagine the world. According to some historians of science, the idea of “religion” and “science” as opposing terms requiring reconciliation, eternal as it may seem to us now, dates only to the nineteenth century, at which time there was, for example, a lively debate—incited by Freud’s wife’s uncle—over whether katharsis (purification, purging), the term Aristotle used to describe the effect of tragedy on an audience, had primarily a medical or a religious connotation. Freud himself would complicate the categories again in his study of hysteria: a disease marked by diverse physical symptoms in the absence of a physiological cause, occurring primarily in women. In the eighteen-eighties, Josef Breuer came up with and introduced Freud to a treatment he called the cathartic method. In Freud’s subsequent works, which were more radical and which proposed treating physical symptoms through, for example, the interpretation of dreams, he drew support from his knowledge of the temples of Asklepios, alluding to “such familiar procedures” from antiquity as “the elicitation of oracular dreams by sleeping in the temple precincts.” The records from the Asklepion at Epidaurus mentioned patients whose symptoms—headaches, paralysis, blindness, stomach distress—matched those of hysteria. Freud had identified closely with the character of Oedipus since he was in high school, where he studied classical Greek. At the University of Vienna, he dreamed that he would be recognized for solving the riddle of the Sphinx. In his psychoanalytic office, he had an approximately two-thousand-year-old Greek Sphinx statue on his table and a reproduction of Ingres’s “Oedipus and the Sphinx” over the couch. His bookplates had a Sphinx on them. For Freud’s fiftieth birthday, his followers gave him a medallion engraved with an image of Oedipus and the Sphinx. Some sources say that, when Freud read the inscription—a quote from Sophocles that read, roughly, “he who knew the famous riddles and was a most powerful man”—he went pale: his adolescent fantasy had come true. The basic insight of psychology, as it has come to us via Freud, is closely connected to the riddle of the Sphinx: “What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?” Oedipus’ answer is man—who crawls as a baby, walks unassisted as an adult, and uses a cane in old age. Thus do some strands of psychology tell us that babies and children are already people, with emotions and boundaries and dignity that can be violated, and that these violations cause sickness in adults. Psychology also tells us that all adults, with no exceptions, were once babies, and aren’t free from the indignities they suffered in this capacity. These truths may seem self-evident, and classicists have occasionally critiqued the riddle of the Sphinx for being too easy: why was nobody able to solve it before Oedipus? And yet, however clear it is to us, intellectually, that the adult who walks around on two feet is the same person as the baby who crawled on hands and knees, we rarely acknowledge it fully. The adult doesn’t look the same as the baby, or feel the same. “Former baby” isn’t part of anyone’s self-image. All we want is to forget that we were ever so weak and helpless. The riddle of the Sphinx plays out in the plot of “Oedipus,” particularly in a scene near the end where the truth finally comes out. Two key figures from Oedipus’ infancy are brought in for questioning: the Theban shepherd, who was supposed to kill baby Oedipus but didn’t; and the Corinthian messenger to whom he handed off the maimed child. The Theban shepherd is walking proof that the Sphinx’s riddle is hard, because that man can’t recognize anyone: not the Corinthian, whom he last saw as a young man, and certainly not Oedipus, a baby with whom he’d had a passing acquaintance decades earlier. “It all took place so long ago,” he grumbles. “Why on earth would you ask me?” “Because,” the Corinthian (David Strathairn) explained genially on Zoom, “this man whom you are now looking at was once that child.” This, for me, was the scene with the catharsis in it. At a certain point, the shepherd (Frankie Faison) clearly understood everything, but would not or could not admit it. Oedipus, now determined to learn the truth at all costs, resorted to enhanced interrogation. “Bend back his arms until they snap,” Isaac said icily; in another window, Faison screamed in highly realistic agony. Faison was a personification of psychological resistance: the mechanism a mind develops to protect itself from an unbearable truth. Those invisible guardsmen had to nearly kill him before he would admit who had given him the baby: “It was Laius’s child, or so people said. Your wife could tell you more.” Tears glinted in Isaac’s eyes as he delivered the next line, which I suddenly understood to be the most devastating in the whole play: “Did . . . she . . . give it to you?” How had I never fully realized, never felt, how painful it would have been for Oedipus to realize that his parents hadn’t loved him? In a famous early essay called “The Aetiology of Hysteria” (1896), Freud described his treatment of eighteen patients suffering from severe hysterical symptoms. In each case, he laboriously traced each symptom back as far as human memory would go—all the way to early childhood. Over the course of more than a hundred hours, each patient independently recovered a memory of early-childhood sexual trauma. The trauma frequently involved an interaction with an adult, often a close relative, like a father. Both Freud and the patients were horrified. The patients’ memories were “reproduced with the greatest reluctance,” Freud wrote. “While they are recalling these infantile experiences to consciousness, they suffer under the most violent sensations, of which they are ashamed and which they try to conceal.” Freud was extremely reluctant to believe that eighteen people from respected Vienna families could have been abused as children. (Indeed, he soon backed away from this conclusion, developing his idea of the Oedipus complex, according to which the incestuous abuse wasn’t a real memory, but rather an infantile fantasy.) But, at least in 1896, he found himself unable not to believe the experiences that the patients relived in front of him. The remembered scenes fit the larger story with the specificity of a missing puzzle piece; in two cases, he found witnesses to corroborate the patients’ memories. So, in “The Aetiology of Hysteria,” as in “Oedipus the King,” an investigation into an inexplicable physical illness (hysteria for Freud, plague for Sophocles) turns up a seemingly unrelated, decades-old, father-implicating act of violence against a child. Wrestling out the truth is a huge ordeal. The ex-child denies it as long as possible. When the truth is finally spoken, the plague is over. When I talked to Bryan Doerries over Zoom after the performance, he told me that he had initially planned to stage “Oedipus” with a focus on climate change. The themes were all there: a prophecy denied; children paying for the sins of the fathers; a plague that “ravaged the land, killing the cattle and the crops,” and which Sophocles compared to a raging wildfire; as well as birth defects (“our women die in labor, delivering shrivelled little corpses. . .”). He was hoping to cast Greta Thunberg as Tiresias or the chorus. But once covid-19 happened, and a physical plague started revealing and exacerbating the preëxisting conditions of the body politic, a new application suggested itself. (A U.K. production of “Oedipus,” starring Damian Lewis, is scheduled for September 3rd. “The narrative of a leader who discovers that he’s the contagion will probably have a different resonance there,” Doerries reflected; Boris Johnson had just returned to work after his own bout of covid-19.) Doerries’s first encounter with Greek tragedy was playing one of the children in “Medea.” (That’s the one where Medea kills her children: his one line was, “No, no, the sword is falling!”) It was 1985, and he was nine years old. The performance took place at a community college in Newport News, where Doerries’s father taught experimental psychology. Doerries describes his father as one of the last old-school behaviorists, a follower of B. F. Skinner, who was known for his belief that free will is an illusion, and that human and animal behavior are determined by positive or negative conditioning. As a child, Doerries often visited his father’s lab, where he watched albino rats act out the fate dictated to them by rewards and punishments. In one experiment, rats were electrically shocked, seemingly at random, until they gave up on life, resting their heads on the floor of their cages and waiting to die. Doerries went to Kenyon College, where he majored in classics, learning ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and the principles of Biblical exegesis. When he and his father debated the meaning of Greek tragedy, his father thought the plays represented a world view in which people didn’t have “human agency or consciousness.” Doerries disagreed. The analogy he uses now for the working of fate in Greek tragedy is Type 2 diabetes, the disease that eventually killed his father. Most people who get the diagnosis, he explains, have a genetic predisposition—it’s “written into their DNA, like an ancient intergenerational curse”—but they can choose what they do with the knowledge, and that choice can change their own and others’ lives. For his senior project, Doerries translated and staged Euripides’ “Bacchae,” using a Buick Skylark for the deus ex machina. A career choice loomed between academia and theatre. Interpreting a classical text, translating it, and directing a play are traditionally viewed as different jobs, to be done by different kinds of professionals, but Doerries saw them as one thing: a set of techniques to get old plays to work on new audiences. He applied to grad school for classics, then changed his mind and moved to New York to pursue directing. In New York, he began dating Laura Rothenberg, a friend of many years, then a Brown undergraduate, who had just gotten a double lung transplant in a long-shot effort to treat the cystic fibrosis she had been fighting since childhood. Becoming involved with her was kind of a test. As Doerries later wrote in “Theater of War,” a book about how his company came into being, “From the moment we first kissed, awkwardly, hesitantly, in her apartment, I knew I would soon face a choice, one that would define my own moral character and perhaps the rest of my life. If I truly cared for Laura, then I would put everything else on hold. . . . But a nagging and persistent voice of self-preservation within me said to run away, as fast as I could.” He didn’t run away. Nor did the voice shut up. Doerries ended up being Rothenberg’s primary caretaker, and during that period he witnessed intubations, “air hunger,” and the “drowning on the inside” that accompanies cystic fibrosis. He was twenty-six, and had never felt so close to anyone, or realized his own “immense capacity to care for another person.” At the same time, he found himself discovering the limits of that compassion—the unbearableness, at times, of the plea to be present—and had never felt so alone. It was then that he reread Sophocles’ “Philoctetes.” It felt as if it had been written for him. When the play starts, Philoctetes has been stranded for ten years on a desert island, with a suppurating, foul-smelling wound on his foot. He was bitten by a snake when he and the other Greek warriors stopped on an island on the way to fight in the Trojan War. His agonized screams were destroying the other soldiers’ morale, so Odysseus left him behind. Then the Trojan War dragged on for a decade, and a seer told Odysseus that the Greeks couldn’t win without Philoctetes. Now Odysseus has come back to the island to get him—bringing a young soldier, Neoptolemus, to do the talking. Doerries realized that “Philoctetes” was about chronic illness—the way every sick person is on a desert island—and about the temptation to leave them there and forget about them. After Rothenberg died, in 2003, at the age of twenty-two, he started work on a translation of the play. By the time he was finishing it, Doerries was back in a hospital, where his father was recovering from a kidney transplant, necessitated by his worsening diabetes. (Doerries’s father had found out about the diabetes in 1976, the year Doerries was born, but had eventually given up on changing his life style, viewing the diagnosis as fate.) Doerries now calls hospitals his “finishing school”: the place where he came into contact with what the Greek plays were about. In 2007, at the Weill Cornell medical school, he staged the first Theater of War Productions-style event: a dramatic reading of “Philoctetes,” followed by a discussion. It was written up in the Times, and when Doerries’s father, who was suffering from an ulcerated foot, read the article, he missed the mention of Philoctetes and thought he was reading about himself and his foot. In June, I saw Theater of War Productions do a Zoom staging of a scene from “Philoctetes” for Baltimore-area front-line health-care workers. Neoptolemus (Jesse Eisenberg) was trying to get Philoctetes (David Strathairn) to agree to help the Greeks. Philoctetes kept seeming like he was going to agree, then would start screaming in pain, expressing his anger at Odysseus, his fear of being abandoned again. The scene was extremely hard to watch. A respiratory technician said afterward that she felt as if she was hearing what the covid-19 patients she dealt with were thinking, but did not have the lung capacity to express. Eisenberg’s face registered all the dismay of someone who is realizing, belatedly, just what he signed up for: being on a desert island face to face with a screaming embodiment of unmeetable need. Doerries described “Philoctetes” to me as a “moment of concrescence”—a “dawning that this is a path for me out of all this.” As in a Freudian case history, new pieces kept fitting into the puzzle. A few weeks later, reading about the Walter Reed scandal, in which Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were left languishing in an understaffed D.C. hospital plagued by vermin, black mold, and bureaucratic dysfunction, Doerries started to think about Philoctetes, too, as a veteran. Technological advances in warfare and medicine had created “a subclass of patients” like him, all abandoned on their islands to live potentially long and unbearable lives. A few months later, he read another exposé about a hundred and twenty-one incidents of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who, on their return to the United States, were charged with killing someone. Reading about soldiers who come home only to “find themselves at war with their spouses, their children, their fellow service members, the world at large and ultimately themselves,” Doerries realized he was seeing a multiplication of Sophocles’ “Ajax”: the tragedy of a war hero who loses his friend, comes home mad with grief, massacres livestock, and tries, in Doerries’s translation, to strangle his wife in his sleep. How had Doerries not recognized in it a textbook description of combat trauma? Sophocles himself had been a general in the Athenian army—at least twice. And it wasn’t just Sophocles: Aeschylus’ gravestone, which didn’t mention that he was a playwright, praised him for fighting in the Battle of Marathon. Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Euripides, the three most famous Greek tragedians, wrote their works in the course of a century in which Athens was at war for roughly eighty years. Every citizen—a category that excluded women, children, and slaves—was also a soldier. They were constantly having to fight, and then return home. How many great tragedies—“Agamemnon,” “The Madness of Heracles”—were about men who couldn’t switch the social contract back on? Doerries started thinking of Greek tragedy in functional terms, as “ritual reintegration, for combat veterans, by combat veterans.” It was, in a way, a continuation of his argument with his father. If his father had viewed the plays as more or less static representations of a fatalistic world view, Bryan saw them as an “ancient technology”—a program that you run, on an audience, to do something specific. What if he could start it up again? In 2008, Doerries mounted his first combat-trauma event, for several hundred Marines and their families, in a Hyatt ballroom in San Diego. In his book, he describes the ensuing scene of painful awkwardness, with Marines in the back of the room “nursing Budweisers, gazing at the floor,” and everyone cringing as Ajax and Philoctetes screamed unsayable things at the top of their lungs. In the discussion afterward, the unsayable continued to be said. “My husband went away four times to war, and each time he returned, like Ajax, dragging invisible bodies into our house,” stated the wife of a Navy seal, who was also the mother of a Marine. She invoked the words of Ajax’s wife, asking his comrades for help: “How can I say something that should never be spoken? You would rather die than hear what I’m about to say.” A nun who had been an Army chaplain stood up and said that one of Ajax’s lines—“Witness how the generals have destroyed me!”—was something she’d heard from countless soldiers. At that point, the wife of the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, who was sitting in the front with some other generals’ wives, stood up and accused the nun and the seal’s wife of undermining their husbands. “This is about healing, not assigning blame!” Soon, at least thirty people were lined up at the microphone. The session became a conversation between people usually prevented by different hierarchies and norms from addressing one another. Not long afterward, the Theater of War Productions got a $3.7 million contract from the Pentagon to replicate the program on military sites around the world. During the First World War, soldiers who had fought in trenches began to display a range of troubling symptoms: muteness, speech disorders, nightmares, paralyses, blindness, headaches, and uncontrollable screaming. Some military doctors noted their similarity to the symptoms of hysterical women, but hesitated to diagnose the soldiers with hysteria, at risk of impugning their courage and masculinity. The new diagnosis they invented, “shell shock,” was based on a theory, later disproved, that its cause was “organic” damage resulting from proximity to exploding shells. Despite its manly name, the treatment for shell shock, Elaine Showalter points out, was pretty much the same as the treatment for hysteria: torture, by electric shocks and isolation, designed to get the patient back in the trenches A.S.A.P. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it became increasingly clear that hysteria and shell shock shared not just many symptoms but also an underlying mechanism. Studies conducted or supported by second-wave feminists were yielding new data on domestic violence, rape, and child abuse, at the same time that Vietnam veterans and antiwar activists were finally managing to get combat trauma recognized as a legitimate affliction. Repeated assaults on women and children, often by the people they most trusted, had been producing the same feelings of unremitting physical terror, loss of self, and blockages of memory and language that soldiers experienced in a war. In other words, what had seemed to be a lot of different problems, or non-problems, with different causes, or with no cause, was accepted as a single, real phenomenon. This was the foundational insight of what became known as trauma studies as we might think of it today. In 1980, post-traumatic stress disorder (P.T.S.D.) was added to the DSM-III, based on data from Vietnam vets, Holocaust survivors, and the survivors of sexual trauma. Judith Herman, an eminent figure in trauma studies, has observed that every advancement in the study of trauma has taken place only with the help of an accompanying progressive political movement. “It never happened; the victim lies; the victim exaggerates; the victim brought it upon herself; and in any case it is time to forget the past and move on”: trauma is inevitably met by the same denials, which are advanced by perpetrators, and accepted by everyone else, because we are all predisposed to identify with power. (By the same token, soldiers come home to realize that “no one wants to know the real truth about war.”) Believing victims is a lot more work than believing people who have brought about, or benefit from, the status quo; after all, perpetrators and beneficiaries ask only for our neutrality, whereas a victim asks us to listen to, and empathize with, their long, awful story. Furthermore, believing the disempowered involves overcoming some of our most deeply ingrained ideas, like that it’s natural or appropriate for children and women to be subordinated in the family, or for young men to be sacrificed in wars. The recognition of trauma becomes so controversial that it ends up being suppressed, unless it is legitimized by a political movement. Rape trauma wasn’t taken to be credible and real until second-wave feminism emerged; the antiwar movement did the same thing for combat trauma. The major progressive movements of recent years, #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, are both about acknowledging the credibility of certain long-denied traumas. The broken N.D.A.s and the cell-phone videos put new information into the public sphere. Something many individuals had known, and even experienced, but hadn’t always named to themselves or to others, became accepted as reality. The reason Greek tragedy works for so many of our social issues is that virtually all the tragedies, like the social issues, dramatize the conservative, contagious impulse to deny trauma: to negate that anyone is a victim or that anything bad is happening. Then someone defies the impulse and screams horrifying stuff that nobody wants to hear, and the spell is broken. Where does the impulse of victim-denial come from? Many psychologists of trauma would say that the answer is early childhood. The psychoanalyst Alice Miller traced numerous individual and political ills to “the Fourth Commandment”—the one about honoring thy parents—some version of which exists in many religions. For Miller, it might more accurately be translated as “Thou shalt not be aware,” because it has produced a taboo against children admitting the reality of their own experiences. Even the life of a loved infant is not an easy one. According to Miller, parents often have children in order to satisfy their own unmet needs for love, respect, and attention, or to please their own parents. (The phrase “have children” itself, perhaps, carries the implication that children are their parents’ property: a moral and legal notion that has been with us since Aristotle.) Infants, being totally dependent on their caretakers for their survival, come to live in mortal terror of disappointing their parents and losing their love. “For most people, the idea that they were not loved by their parents is unbearable,” Miller writes. “The more evidence there is for this deprivation, the more strongly these people cling to the illusion.” In other words, the first victim we don’t believe is ourselves. What most of us are unable to feel for these powerless former selves is the “pity and terror”—the Aristotelian catharsis—that is evoked in the course of a tragedy like “Oedipus.” Before the catharsis, when Oedipus is asked about his scars, he reacts only with shame: “Why do you speak of that ancient disgrace? . . . A shameful disfigurement that has scarred me since birth.” He must believe that the scars are inborn (not inflicted by his parents), and also somehow his own fault (“shameful,” “a disgrace”). It’s only through the confrontation with the Theban shepherd that he is able to feel, in all its belated immediacy, the terror he had to block off in order to survive. But, by that point, he has already passed on his trauma to all the “children of Thebes,” including his literal sons—whom he curses, and who eventually murder each other in a civil war. Repressed trauma produces wars, just as it is produced by them, in armies structured like families, with junior people forbidden to criticize their superiors. Based on her study of the German child-rearing manuals popular around Hitler’s parents’ generation, Alice Miller, who was a Holocaust survivor, concluded that beating children “for their own good”—training them to accept and idealize their own abuse—is the perfect way to produce obedient subjects of an authoritarian government. Children whose perceptions haven’t been respected become adults who support strongmen who rule by gaslighting and disinformation. Children who aren’t allowed “to be aware of their own needs or to defend their own interests,” as she wrote, will never know them. This is the simplest answer to the much-debated question of why people vote against their own interests: the connection between “my interests” and “good” has been scrambled at an early age. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower, has said that the algorithm he worked on there found that one of the strongest predictors for vulnerability to alt-right nationalism is whether a person is in favor of corporal punishment for children. The algorithm was initially devised to identify potential isis recruits, who apparently share the alt-right’s enthusiasm for beating children. The worship of power, the silencing of dissent and of logic, and the dehumanization of everyone perceived as weak or other are characteristics shared by authoritarian groups across the ideological spectrum. They might, according to Miller’s study, exercise a magnetic effect on people who were dehumanized as children. The Trump Administration is known for its readiness to put children in harm’s way, whether by actually placing them in cages, or by maintaining, despite evidence to the contrary, that they are “almost immune” to covid-19. It is a truism among standup comics and on Twitter that Trump wasn’t loved as a child; a new memoir by the President’s psychologist niece makes the house of Fred Trump sound a lot like the house of Laius: a place where children are raised to become “killers,” and kindness is viewed as a form of criminal idiocy. But the immense political and economic harm caused by the dehumanization of children has not yet been treated as the urgent public-health crisis it is. Invoking childhood is often dismissed as a way of depoliticizing, of trying to “reduce” the affairs of nations to what happened between mommy and daddy. And yet, as Tolstoy shows in his quarantine-compatible classic “War and Peace,” what happens between mommy and daddy may cause little Nikolai or Petya to flee their feelings of humiliation and disempowerment by joining a war, thus determining the fate of nations. We must do for childhood what the second-wave feminists did for the lives of women (and tried, in some radical cases, to do for children): politicize and de-privatize, eroding the rules that turn each family into a closed-off realm where the weakest players (women, children) have no recourse against the strongest (men, adults). Perhaps the greatest obstacle to seeing the political reality of childhood is our attachment to the moral scaffolding of individual blame and personal responsibility. Within this framework, to ascribe any of Hitler’s actions to his upbringing is seen as going easy on Hitler, or as blaming the Holocaust on Hitler’s parents. And yet, to quote Alice Miller, “it is not a matter of assigning blame to individual parents . . . but of identifying a hidden societal structure that determines our lives.” Western thought since Aristotle has largely construed children as lacking in reason and thus in full personhood. The resulting systemic inability to view children as fully human resembles the kind of moral alibi that has been used to excuse slavery and anti-Black racism, and is still with us in parts of the law and custom. Early learning—especially the education of children between birth and age three, which is the period when the most brain development takes place—is widely viewed either as the inalienable labor of mothers, or as an unskilled job rightly left to low-status women. The essence of structural or systemic problems is that they can’t be solved by isolating and punishing individual culprits, leaving the rest of the society pure. Which individuals should be isolated, punished, or removed, so that our workplaces aren’t toxic to women? Which individual is really a racist? The power of “Oedipus” is that it eventually reveals such questions to be the wrong ones. Who is to blame for the Plague of Thebes? Is it Oedipus, because he killed Laius? But Laius tried to kill him, when he was a defenseless baby. Then again, Laius thought the baby was going to kill him. On the other hand, Laius raped the son of the king of Pelops, and yet, if you look up why Laius raped the son of the king of Pelops, it all really started when he was driven from Thebes in his youth. And on and on. By introducing the theme of plague into his “Oedipus,” Sophocles invites us to replace the mechanism of blame with that of contagion. Of course, within a given plague, individuals may be responsible for making things worse: mask refuseniks, governors who won’t issue stay-at-home orders, or, you know, Pericles, for making the whole Attic countryside crowd into Athens. But we don’t normally expect whoever gave us a respiratory virus to be punished. Questions of personal responsibility are ultimately viewed as secondary to questions of cure and containment. It is in the context of contagion that I first felt able to understand the role of fate, which is surely the most foreign thing to us in Greek drama. “So does he have a choice, or doesn’t he?” we ask in exasperation. It’s the conundrum that Doerries and his father used to argue about, and it’s at the heart of the confusion elicited by questions of systemic injustice: “How responsible or complicit am I?” Defunding the police and decriminalizing mental illness, addiction, and poverty are ways to shift the conversation from “Who is to blame?” to “What is to be done?” Fate, like plague, gives us a way to remove guilt and innocence from the equation. Fate is plague. We are what we catch. But that doesn’t mean there’s no way to change it. If we borrow the terms of Greek drama, 2020 might be viewed as the year of anagnorisis: tragic recognition. On August 9th, the sixth anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown, I watched the Theater of War Productions put on a Zoom production of “Antigone in Ferguson”: an adaptation of Sophocles’ “Oedipus” narrative sequel, with the chorus represented by a demographically and ideologically diverse gospel choir. Oscar Isaac was back, this time as Creon, Oedipus’ successor as king. He started out as a bullying inquisitor (“I will have your extremities removed one by one until you reveal the criminal’s name”), ordering Antigone (Tracie Thoms) to be buried alive, insulting everyone who criticized him, and accusing Tiresias of corruption. But then Tiresias, with the help of the chorus, persuaded Creon to reconsider. In a sustained gospel number, the Thebans, armed with picks and shovels, led by their king, rushed to free Antigone. “Antigone” being a tragedy, they got there too late, resulting in multiple deaths, and in Isaac’s once again totally losing his shit. It was almost the same performance he gave in “Oedipus,” and yet, where Oedipus begins the play written into a corner, between walls that keep closing in, Creon seems to have just a little more room to maneuver. His misfortune—like that of Antigone and her brother—feels less irreversible. I first saw “Antigone in Ferguson” live, last year, and, in the discussion afterward, the subject of fate—inevitably—came up. I remember how Doerries gently led the audience to view “Antigone” as an illustration of how easily everything might happen differently, and how people’s minds can change. I remember the energy that spread through the room that night, in talk about prison reform and the urgency of collective change. Tragic theatre and democracy arose around the same time in Athens, and some scholars maintain that the two are related: that Athens’s “homegrown literary vehicle allowed its citizens to think through how to run their democracy.” It’s a tempting theory, especially with “Antigone” in mind. On August 9th, the performance was followed by a panel discussion with the Mothers of the Movement, an activist group comprising women whose Black children have been killed by police. “Antigone was very much like us,” said Marion Gray-Hopkins, whose nineteen-year-old son Gary Hopkins, Jr., was killed in 1999. “Creon is very much like the legislators that we are dealing with every single day.” Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, beamed in her Zoom window and said, “Yes!” “I was kind of proud of him,” Gray-Hopkins continued, of Creon. She noted that he had initially seemed impermeable to reason and to new information, and then suddenly “decided he was listening. So we are continuing to talk to people,” she said, “because somebody is hearing our voice.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Will the Coronavirus Spare the World’s Most Remote Places?,18216,"The town of Unalaska is the largest in the Aleutians, a chain of active volcanic islands off Alaska’s southwestern coast. Unalaska is spread across two islands, which are surrounded by the stormy Bering Sea, and often by rolling clouds of fog. To get here from the Lower Forty-eight—or “Outside,” as the continental U.S. is sometimes called—you have to fly through Seattle (usually) and then Anchorage (always) in a small propeller plane. Most times, the plane is unable to land in Unalaska, because of the fog or a storm, and has to refuel in Sand Point, King Salmon, or Cold Bay, and wait for the weather to clear. Food reaches the town, which has some four thousand residents, by barge. Cell service is limited, and the Internet is slow and paid for by the gigabyte. When the city has an announcement, it posts it on local bulletin boards and sends a “blast fax” to every machine in town. Alaska is a state of preppers. Everyone I know has a freezer full of fish, berries, and game. The house I live in—which, until I moved here, in February, was unoccupied for months—has a freezer the size of a coffin in the study. When I opened it one evening, I found neat rows of tundra blueberries, ice cream, and soup stock, all stacked on top of rows of whole, frozen salmon. Residents in Sitka—where I used to live—occasionally take a ten-hour ferry ride to Juneau to shop at Costco, which is revered for its bulk sizes. In Unalaska, we have a store called Alaska Ship Supply, where fishing captains can stock up on five-gallon cans of tomatoes and ninety-six-ounce jars of jalapeños before heading back out to sea. In mid-March, as outbreaks of covid-19 spread across the Lower Forty-eight, a rumor began to circulate in town that the barges would stop coming and the islands would run out of food. Panic shopping began. But, during a live call-in show on local radio, Megan Sarnecki, a doctor, pointed out that there are currently millions of pounds of frozen pollock sitting in the freezers of the local fish-processing plants. We won’t starve, though we may get sick of fish. As of this writing, there are two hundred and ninety-one confirmed cases of covid-19 in Alaska, one of the lowest case counts in the country. The majority of these cases are in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Unalaska, along with most other more remote parts of the state, has been spared so far. On a local radio show, the city manager, mayor, and fire chief were asked whether they thought it would be possible to avoid an outbreak on the island. After a five-second pause, Erin Reinders, the city manager, said, “Nobody wants to answer that question. I am a very positive person, but the likelihood of any one of us stopping a virus from coming here is very challenging.” Unalaska has the largest fishing port in the United States. During peak fishing season, from January to October, an additional ten thousand people filter through the airport and harbor. In town, there are four large fish-processing plants, which employ thousands of seasonal workers. Processors tend to come from the Philippines and Eastern Europe, and they all fly through Seattle. They often live in shared bunkhouses and eat at a communal mess hall. At the end of March, Governor Mike Dunleavy banned all nonessential travel within the state. (Fishing—like drilling and mining—is considered “essential” here.) All four plants pledged to stop flying in additional employees, and three have already enacted quarantines for recent arrivals. It’s more difficult to control individual travellers. Fishing boats still fly in new crews weekly. Public-safety personnel in Unalaska have begun meeting incoming flights at the airport to provide information about the state’s mandatory fourteen-day quarantine; in a town as small as ours, they can spot someone new. Local public-safety officials have also set up a hotline that residents can use to report new arrivals who aren’t quarantining. Shortly after the city posted the number on Facebook, a resident called out an unnamed taxi driver who had recently returned from Las Vegas and “started driving her cab right away.” A city employee responded that public-safety officers were aware and had “contacted the driver.” If the virus does come, the results could be devastating. Unalaska is the largest Alaskan town without a hospital. There is a clinic—Iliuliuk Family and Health Services—with two doctors and a small staff. The clinic has three ventilators, more than most communities of our size have. But when asked whether those ventilators would be enough, Murray Buttner, one of the doctors, replied, “It’s probably more than we’d ever be able to handle.” With such a small medical staff, even three patients on ventilators would be overwhelming. In the past, anyone needing critical care was stabilized as much as possible and then flown a thousand miles east to the nearest hospital. Sometimes, the planes are delayed for hours or even days because of weather; during fog or heavy wind, not even medical planes can leave the island. “It’s kind of like the tidal-wave siren went off,” Sarah Spelsberg, a physician assistant at the clinic, told me. “You’ve moved to high ground, and you’re hunkered down, and you’re just sort of waiting to see if it’s going to destroy everything you care about.” Spelsberg often takes the night shift and finds herself walking through the clinic counting high-efficiency particulate air (hepa) filters, calculating how many people she could ventilate at one time. Last week, she stopped by Alaska Ship Supply for materials to build vent splitters as a last resort. “I can probably save two critical people,” she said. “But if ten come in all at once, I’m in big trouble. We’re all in big trouble.” During a pandemic, remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Experts have speculated that lower population densities might help limit the spread of the virus, as might minimal contact with other communities. In January, Papua New Guinea, one of the most sparsely visited regions in the world, banned all travel from Asia and shut its land border with Indonesia; in late March, the government grounded all domestic flights for two weeks. The country has reported only two covid-19 cases—a health worker and a foreign mine worker. On the other hand, if the novel coronavirus does make its way to rural communities, residents may be particularly vulnerable, as they tend to congregate around only a few places: the local grocery store, the same gas station, the post office. “Everyone, when they do go out, must go to that one location, essentially increasing the likelihood of spread,” Kevin Bennett, the director of research and evaluation at the University of South Carolina Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare, told me. The virus is now beginning to arrive even in very remote locations. There are a smattering of cases across island nations in the Pacific. In the Amazon, a Yanomami teen-ager and an eighty-seven-year-old Borari woman became Brazil’s first indigenous cases. On March 28th, Sublette County, Wyoming—with a population density of about 2.1 people per square mile—reported its first case. More than forty-six million Americans live in rural areas. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural residents tend to be older, display higher rates of heart and respiratory diseases, and have to travel longer distances for access to emergency and specialty health care. In the past decade, a hundred and twenty rural hospitals have closed—including nineteen last year. In a study from February, another four hundred and fifty hospitals were marked as vulnerable to closure. (More have likely become vulnerable since the pandemic began: elective procedures are often the most profitable, but those are now halted across the country.) Rural hospitals are also further down the supply chain for masks and other protective equipment, increasing the risk of virus exposure for health-care workers and patients. Even before the pandemic, rural health-care workers were stretched thin. “Health-care providers are working more hours and playing many different roles,” Diane Hall, a senior scientist at the C.D.C., told me. Some rural communities have no reliable transportation, Internet access, pharmacy, or grocery store. Should an outbreak occur, it could “leave an already vulnerable population without immediate access to health care.” Alaska has the lowest population density of any state, and of almost any country. A third of Alaskans live in officially designated rural communities, but even places designated as non-rural would be considered isolated by the average New Yorker: Homer, for example, is a non-rural city of about five thousand and six hundred people, a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Anchorage. Since Canada closed its borders, in early March, Alaska has been nearly hermetically sealed; all travel to and from the state is by air or water, which theoretically makes it easier to control. The population is small enough for the state health system to track the confirmed active cases—where they went, who they came in contact with. All of this has helped keep Alaska’s case count relatively low. “We do have great distances in the state,” Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, said. “Which can be both an advantage as well as a limitation.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? Alaskan villages often have just a couple hundred people, and many are predominantly Alaska Native. Most villages are accessible only by boat, snow machine, or bush plane. Unlike in the Lower Forty-eight, where rural settlements can be dispersed, Alaskan communities tend to be tightly packed. Most material (including wood: there are few trees in the tundra) must be flown in by cargo plane or shipped by barge, which makes infrastructure expensive to build. Houses tend to be clustered around city centers. If the virus gets in, it will spread quickly. Most villages have no hospital—just an Indian Health Service clinic, with perhaps a single health-care worker. Medicine often arrives by plane. Globalization has also made remote places, in a meaningful sense, far less remote. Alaska hosts pockets of huge, international industries—oil, fishing, mining—which attract armies of out-of-state workers. Many of these workers travel through small, hyper-rural communities. Utqiaġvik, a town of about four thousand people, is the economic center of the North Slope, which produced more than four hundred thousand barrels of oil a day in 2019. Oil companies now require that workers receive a health screening from a private company when they arrive in Anchorage on their way to the Slope. (Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, told Science that airport screenings “will only delay a local epidemic and not prevent it.”) The governor’s office is now requiring that companies share some mitigation protocols with the state for review, though Alaska Public Media recently reported that the administration is refusing to release the plans to the host communities. I asked Zink about efforts to control contagion from industry in Alaska. “This is really a joint effort,” she said. “This is to every company, every business owner, every individual, every family, every care center to check out the [C.D.C.] guidelines and follow those closely.” Rural Alaska has a dark history of epidemics. In 1900, twin waves of illness—influenza and measles—swept across the western part of the state. Native communities lost between twenty-five and fifty per cent of their residents. The town of Unalaska lost a third of its population. Alaskans called the crisis the Great Sickness. Historians are unsure exactly why Native communities were so hard hit. It might be that Native communities had been exposed to fewer previous strains of the viruses and had therefore built up less immunity. Extreme cold and lack of food may have worsened outcomes. Native villages also had less access to medical care than did their white counterparts. (American-European occupiers were barely affected.) Not long after, the flu of 1918 reached Alaska. The governor imposed travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, but the pandemic still slipped into Native communities, to devastating effect: Alaska Natives accounted for only forty-eight per cent of the state’s population but for more than eighty per cent of its Spanish-flu deaths. The village of Brevig Mission lost seventy-two of its eighty residents in five days. One schoolteacher reported at the time that three villages were “wiped out entirely.” Alaska’s death rate was higher than that of any other territory in the world, except Samoa. In the past thirty years, Alaska Natives have had much higher death rates from pneumonia and the flu than do white Alaskans. The fear of such an epidemic returning “has informed Alaska’s covid-19 response,” Michael Bruce, the director of the C.D.C.’s Arctic Investigations Program, told me. In certain areas, containment, instead of mitigation, may still be possible. In the governor’s mandate banning local travel, he specified that communities smaller than three thousand people, off the road system, and without a local hospital are allowed to enact even stricter policies, including banning even “essential” travel. Hyper-rural places in Alaska have started isolating themselves from the outside world in an attempt to prevent the virus from arriving. Akutan, a town of a hundred residents, also hosts Trident Seafoods, the largest fish-processing plant in North America, which has fourteen hundred seasonal employees, who live half a mile from the town. The plant has stopped bringing in new workers and sealed itself off from Akutan. Joe Bereskin, Akutan’s mayor, told me that if the plant hadn’t closed itself off, the virus would surely have reached the town. “I appreciate their effort to try and beat the curve,” he said. Towns in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta—an area of forty-eight small communities scattered across fifty-five thousand square miles—are also sealing themselves off. The region has no road system, and the only hospital is in Bethel, a plane ride away for most inhabitants. Nearly seventeen hundred homes in the area lack running water, which reduces bathing and hand washing and increases the risk of infectious disease. Many communities within the delta are no longer allowing residents to leave or visitors to arrive. In a letter to the governor, leaders asked for help with halting travel to the region. “If COVID-19 begins to spread in the YK-Delta, our healthcare system is vulnerable, our transportation system is vulnerable, our ability to meet basic needs for survival is vulnerable,” the letter read. “By the time the coronavirus spreads to the YK-Delta, it will be too late to prepare for or mitigate the consequences.” Some villages sealed themselves off even before the governor’s order. Allakaket is a predominantly Athabascan town of a hundred and seventy people in northern Alaska, near the Arctic Circle. There are one school, one store, and no linked roads. Most people supplement their food with subsistence hunting or fishing. The only way in or out is by snow machine (in the winter) or by a thrice-weekly prop plane. On March 13th, after a joint meeting between the city and tribal councils, the town closed to all outside visitors. Steven Strassburg, the city administrator, told me, “It seems like a lot of people are taking it seriously,” and added that, since then, everything is “a lot more quiet.” The only exception to the rule is that the plane can still land to deliver freight for the town’s store—but tribal council members gather on the runway during each delivery to make sure no passengers disembark. “If [covid-19] does make it out to the village, it’s not going to be a good situation,” Strassburg said. Strassburg told me that the decision to close was partially motivated by the lingering memory of the 1918 flu: when news of the coronavirus started breaking, residents pushed leaders to remember how many people in their community had died during that pandemic. “Our elders pointed it out in the graveyard, where they buried all the people because of the 1918 Spanish flu,” he said. “They told us not to go in that area anymore. They’re not sure if it can seep back up through the ground.” Allakaket is preparing for a long period of isolation. Strassburg worries the airline that serves the village will shut down at some point, which will mean that there won’t be any more deliveries of food to the town (and also no more mail or medicine). The tribal council recently hired five people to find the local caribou herd and break a trail there using snow-machines, so that residents can hunt to feed their families. The animals are probably some seventy miles outside of town, and the hunters have to find them quickly, before the snow melts and the snow-machine trails are unusable. In the meantime, residents are trapping beaver along the Koyukuk River. “We’re trying to make it through and come out stronger than before,” Strassburg said. “As long as we don’t let anybody in or out anymore, I think we’re in a better spot than anyone in the city.” An earlier version of this article misstated the places for planes to refuel before reaching Unalaska.

The White House’s Push to Reopen the Economy This Early Is a Dangerous Gamble,10497,"At the start of last week, Jonathan Swan, of Axios, reported that the “White House plans to shift its coronavirus messaging toward boosting the economy and highlighting ‘success stories’ of businesses, reducing its public emphasis on health statistics.” The story proved to be accurate. Rather than having Donald Trump appear at a daily coronavirus briefing, his staff set up a series of meetings with business leaders for him to attend. And this past weekend, the White House dispatched two of its economic advisers to appear on television. “By the end of May, almost every state will be mostly open economically,” Kevin Hassett, a former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who recently rejoined the Administration, told Fox & Friends. “We are going to monitor the situation closely, but make no mistake about it, it’s really, really good news that we’ve been able to open up as soon as we have, and to do so according to the guidelines that doctors”—Deborah Birx, the coördinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—“set out.” Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, echoed Hassett’s message. In appearances on CNN and Fox Business, Kudlow predicted that the economy would rebound strongly in the second half of the year, and he said that 2021 could be a “spectacular” year. During a virtual town hall held at the Lincoln Memorial, on Sunday night, Trump didn’t go quite that far. But he did insist that it is possible to end the shutdowns and reopen the economy while protecting the vulnerable. “I think you can really have it both ways,” he said. With Florida, Missouri, and a number of other states allowing many businesses to reopen on Monday morning, the White House’s pivot from messaging about fighting the virus to promoting the economy seemed to be complete. According to a running tally that the Times maintains, twenty-four states in total had already ordered a partial reopening of their economies. But then came a pair of shocking developments. At lunchtime on Monday, the Times published some details of an internal “situation update” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The update, which also bore the seal of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, included a chart showing the number of daily deaths caused by covid-19 rising steadily over the next month and reaching about three thousand—which is roughly seventy per cent more than the current level—by the start of June. Another chart showed the daily number of new cases rising to more than two hundred thousand during the same period, which would represent an even bigger increase in relative terms. In the past few days, the number of positive tests in the U.S. has averaged about thirty thousand, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The White House quickly issued a statement distancing itself from the new projections and saying they hadn’t even been submitted to the coronavirus task force. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed,” the statement said. “The President’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious diseases experts in the federal government agreed with.” Later on Monday, the Washington Post reported that the projections were the work of Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, who had showed his data to the C.D.C. “as a work in progress.” Lessler told the Post that his projections weren’t intended as a forecast, and he didn’t know how they ended up in the C.D.C. update. But Lessler also said that while “the exact numbers and charts in the CDC document may differ from the final results, they do show accurately how Covid-19 cases could spiral out of control.” According to the Post, “He said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility. Much depends on political decisions being made today.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? One thing we’ve learned over the past couple of months is not to place too much stock in any single set of projections. All such predictions are acutely sensitive to assumptions about things like social distancing, travel, and ease of transmission. But even if this particular set of simulations should be treated with caution, the consensus among medical experts is that reopening the economy while the virus is still spreading represents a risky strategy, and the earlier the reopenings take place, the greater the risks. Also on Monday, the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, issued a new projection that showed the cumulative death total rising to a hundred and thirty-five thousand by early August—a big increase over the institute’s previous forecast, which was issued in April and predicted about sixty thousand deaths. “The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” the institute, whose model some states rely on to help plan their medical needs, said in a press release. “Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures—factors that could help slow transmission—do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths.” These warnings echoed statements by other experts and public-health officials, including one who used to work for the Trump Administration. In an op-ed published in Monday’s Wall Street Journal, Scott Gottlieb, who was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 2017 to 2019, pointed out that while the shutdowns and social distancing have had a big effect in places like New York City, the national figures for deaths and new infections have stayed pretty steady over the past month. “Mitigation hasn’t failed; social distancing and other measures have slowed the spread,” Gottlieb wrote. “But the halt hasn’t brought the number of new cases and deaths down as much as expected or stopped the epidemic from expanding.” He added, “as states begin to open up their economies and Americans return to traveling, the disease will continue to expand.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that reopening some parts of the economy is unjustified. The economic shutdown is also imposing huge costs, and governments throughout the world are looking for ways to reduce those costs while protecting the vulnerable and continuing to reduce the infection rate. The reopening guidelines that the White House task force issued in mid-April said states that want to relax their stay-at-home orders should meet a number of requirements. Among them were having a “robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing,” and insuring that “sentinel surveillance sites are screening for asymptomatic cases . . . at locations that serve older individuals, lower-income Americans, racial minorities, and Native Americans.” In many parts of America, this essential preparatory work simply hasn’t been done. Nationwide, the level of testing is running at about two hundred and fifty thousand a day, which is far below the level that many independent medical experts recommend. Last week, some Harvard researchers and the health-news site STAT released a study of individual states, including ones that were planning to reopen soon. “To catch hot spots before they turn into wildfires of disease, Georgia must do 9,600 to 10,000 tests per day; it has been averaging around 4,000,” the study said. “Florida will need 16,000; in the last week it has been hitting just above 10,000.” Texas, which allowed many stores and restaurants to reopen last Friday despite a new case count that is still rising, is another big state that is doing far less testing than experts recommend. To be sure, this testing failure isn’t entirely the states’ fault, although it was their decision to proceed with reopening regardless. With the White House having effectively abdicated responsibility for testing, many states are still having difficulty acquiring the necessary test kits and chemical agents. And, of course, this hasn’t been the only Presidential failure. Even as his own medical advisers have warned against moving too quickly, Trump has defended protestors, including armed ones, who have demonstrated against the state lockdown orders. In the past few days, he has cheered on governors who are relaxing restrictions even as their states have failed to meet some of his Administration’s own safety guidelines. The early reopening is far from the carefully calibrated, carefully monitored exercise that Birx and Fauci, the White House’s two leading medical advisers, talked about when they unveiled the federal guidelines last month. It looks more like a reckless gamble to get the economy going before the November election without sparking a big new wave of infections. Perhaps it will succeed: no one can say for sure either way. But if it doesn’t work out well, and the new projections for the spread of the virus prove to be accurate, the weakest and most vulnerable members of American society will be the ones who bear the heaviest cost.

We Can Solve the Coronavirus-Test Mess Now&#8212;If We Want To,45187,"To get out of this pandemic, we need fast, easy coronavirus testing that’s accessible to everyone. From the way people often talk, you might think we need a technological breakthrough to achieve this. In fact, we don’t have a technological problem; we’ve got an implementation problem. We could have the testing capacity we need within weeks. The reason we don’t is not simply that our national leadership is unfit but also that our health-care system is dysfunctional. Many developed countries have met their testing needs, and ready access to speedy tests has been key to containing outbreaks and resuming social and economic activity. Whether you live in England or South Korea, scheduling is straightforward. No doctor’s order is required. Tests, where indicated, are free. And you typically get results within forty-eight hours. In the United States, getting a test is anything but easy. Take a look at the Texas public directory of covid-19 testing sites, which features a bold, red-highlighted disclaimer: “ATTENTION: Unless otherwise stated, deductible, co-pay, or co-insurance may apply. May require physician referral or prior authorization. Please call site to confirm.” Congress has mandated that insurers fully cover the costs both of testing and of the medical-office visit that produces the test order. But providers may still require payment until the insurer has confirmed coverage. Some twenty-eight million Americans had no insurance before the pandemic, including eighteen per cent of Texans, and millions more have lost their insurance since it started. Although legislation allowed states to expand Medicaid to cover coronavirus testing-related costs for the uninsured, many states (including Texas) have yet to do so. Health-care providers are left to seek disaster-relief funds to cover testing costs for the uninsured. The Texas disclaimer also warns that its test-site directory is incomplete. On another page, the Web site alerts you to additional considerations to take into account when seeking a test site, including what the screening criteria are (sites vary as to whom they are willing to test); whether the site is covered by your insurer; and what types of tests they provide (some may have only antibody tests, which do not help establish a diagnosis). Appointments can take days, results days more. Most testing in the United States is done by four companies—Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, BioReference Laboratories, and Sonic Healthcare. Through early August, results routinely took four days or more, making the tests essentially useless. Times improved only when testing volumes declined, because many people gave up on getting tested. The vast majority of infected Americans, including those with symptoms, never get tested. And we have not even reached the fall, when flu season will hit and coronavirus-testing needs and demand are expected to rise substantially. As the saying goes, it’s as messed up as a pile of coat hangers. Further complicating matters, insurers don’t pay for testing that they don’t consider medically necessary. Yet testing people who don’t have symptoms will be important to getting covid-19 under control. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that around forty per cent of viral transmissions occur before an infected person has any symptoms. Yes, a combination of distancing, hygiene, and mask-wearing when people can’t stay six feet apart can markedly reduce such transmissions. But, in many situations, we can’t count on people being able to maintain those measures. Testing is the only way to know whether a person is potentially contagious and in need of isolation. Such “assurance testing” has been required by countries such as Iceland, France, and Germany for travellers from abroad in order to avoid a mandatory two-week quarantine; by states from Maine and Massachusetts to Hawaii and Alaska for out-of-state travellers; by many U.S. hospitals for all patients admitted for non-emergent surgery; and by the film and television industry, which plans to do regular testing of cast and crew members in order to start production again. The federal government has recommended that nursing homes test all staff once a week. Numerous colleges and universities have included repeated testing in their protocols for bringing students back to campus. Individuals are seeking assurance tests before visiting older family members. The economist Paul Romer has argued for going further, saying that regular testing for every person in the United States should be our lead strategy for getting society back to normal. Those with a recent negative test would have permission to go without a mask; those with a positive test would be required to isolate for two weeks. The small Italian town of Vò, outside Padua City, took a similar approach. It offered testing to all its thirty-three hundred inhabitants at two points over two weeks during lockdown. Eighty-six per cent of the population came forward in the first round. Almost three per cent were infected, half of whom had no symptoms. In the second round, seventy-two per cent of the population was tested, with a 0.3-per-cent new-infection rate. With these last few cases isolated, the town was able to reopen long before the rest of Italy could. But is any of this remotely feasible when we can’t even make sure that sick people can get tested in a timely way? The lunacy of our testing system is the lunacy of our health system in microcosm. We are now paying the price of our long, uniquely American resistance to making sure that everyone has proper health-care coverage, and to building an adequate public-health infrastructure. We have not fully grappled with the difficulties we’re up against. But, if we do, we have a chance to fix the problem before the worst of flu season hits. The course of infection with the sars-CoV-2 virus is relatively brief. It starts with perhaps as little as a few hundred viral particles getting into your respiratory passage; then, if they take hold, they multiply to a viral count so high that you are exhaling millions of viral particles per hour. You are typically at your most contagious around day five of infection. Symptoms usually begin about the same time. In more than eighty per cent of cases, adequate oxygen levels can be maintained without hospitalization, and the body’s immune system can reduce viral counts rapidly. In these mild to moderate cases, researchers have found almost no transmission a week after the onset of symptoms, although recovery takes upward of two to three weeks for a third of such patients. (In cases of serious illness, the reduction in viral counts can take a week or so longer.) The goal of testing is to detect the virus as early as possible during infection. The standard diagnostic test involves, as tens of millions of people now intimately know, a swab of the cavity deep behind the nasal passage—or, as more recently authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, of just inside the nose. A few labs have been approved to test saliva. The sample from the patient is analyzed for evidence of viral genetic material. The method of analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, PCR, is a small wonder of science, and, if it detects the sars-CoV-2 virus, the diagnosis approaches a-hundred-per-cent accuracy: false positives are rare. But false negatives are another matter. The miss rate among people with a symptomatic infection is upward of twenty per cent, owing either to sampling problems (the swab didn’t pick up enough of a specimen) or a viral count too low to be detected. That miss rate is even higher during the four days or so before symptoms begin—going from a hundred per cent on the first day of an infection to sixty-seven per cent on the fourth day, according to a Johns Hopkins study. A negative test is not a guarantee that a person is infection-free. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? A negative test is, however, an indicator that a person is unlikely to be contagious at the time the test was done. As a rule, infectiousness is directly related to viral load, and so are positive test results. Still, each day that passes after a negative test reduces its value. A one-time test is not an adequate solution, then, if you’re the Boston Symphony Orchestra and you want a hundred musicians to be able to practice every day as an ensemble again, with no masks or distancing, while some of them are blowing horns and woodwinds so hard that they have to shake the spit out of them. If a group is going to work or live together on an ongoing basis but can’t take the necessary restrictive measures, or wants to relax them, repeated assurance testing is necessary to avoid outbreaks. How often the testing must be repeated varies from once a day to once a week, depending on the baseline prevalence of infections in the group, among other factors. It’s especially helpful for groups that can be isolated from the larger community. The National Women’s Soccer League did just that, confining participants in its month-long Challenge Cup to an athletic village it created outside Salt Lake City and testing participants on arrival and then before every game. Not a single athlete tested positive after initial screening and admission to the village. A few critics have argued that PCR testing for people without symptoms is overly sensitive, catching many people when their viral counts are too low to be contagious. Some of them, it’s true, could be on the downswing of infection, but most will be on the upswing (when it’s important to catch them), particularly when they’ve had a previous negative test. An oddity about sars-CoV-2 transmission is that many infected people, whether or not they have symptoms, won’t pass it along. (Contact-tracing studies find that, among people who live with someone diagnosed with covid-19, sixty to ninety per cent never become infected.) And yet a particular person can, in the right settings—like a crowded bar or workplace—infect scores of others. There is a measure in epidemiology called the dispersion factor, which indicates how much a disease clusters. sars-CoV-2 has an unusually low dispersion factor—an estimated eighty per cent of transmissions are caused by just ten per cent of cases. By contrast, the 1918 influenza had a very high dispersion factor: there was almost no clustering at all. Perhaps just a subset of people are prone to spread sars-CoV-2. Or perhaps everyone with the infection sheds the virus, but only in occasional eruptions during a short period of infectivity. You stop the spread by avoiding large indoor crowds that could include a person in the midst of an eruption, by masking everyone to contain an eruption, and by testing people so you can identify and isolate positive cases during the period when they can erupt. But that is possible only if you get the results fast. The Kansas State University football team is a cautionary example in this respect. It set out to create a bubble of its own when the N.C.A.A. allowed practices to begin on June 1st. All players were tested upon arrival and isolated as a group from the rest of the community—so far, so good. The first ninety-six players to arrive tested negative. A last group of twenty-four players, largely freshmen, arrived a few days later and were tested on a Friday. But they didn’t get the results until Monday—and that window was all the virus needed. As the Times reported, teammates spent the weekend hanging out. One player who would test positive played video games at an apartment with up to fifteen players; another infected player joined a group that drove out together to a lake. Although the protocol was to wear masks and maintain distancing off the field, the rules slipped. Within a week, two cases had become fourteen, and the team’s practices were shut down. To fix testing, we have to accelerate two lines of operation: test collection and test processing. The primary challenge of test collection—sticking a fifty-cent swab in someone’s nose—is last-mile logistics, which can be more intricate than most realize. You’ve got to manage people flow; it can be a challenge just to find locations where potentially infectious people can turn up without infecting others. Then there’s the flow of supplies, which involves having adequate quantities of the swabs and tubes that your particular lab requires, plus the personal protective equipment required for the staff. There’s the information flow—gathering and linking a patient’s information, the provider information, and the bar code on the specimen tube in a way that the laboratory can deal with. And there’s the financial flow—figuring out the billing system required to get reimbursed by the correct payer, which, for a particular person, could be Medicare or Medicaid, a private insurer, an employer, the state, the patient herself, or any number of other sources. Running a test-collection operation can be a nightmare for scores of reasons. You have to navigate supply shortages, neighborhoods that object to having lines of cars turn up at a pharmacy or clinic parking lot, business-insurance plans that may not cover you if you provide testing, and building owners with liability concerns. You may be unable to use your label printer and computer system if there’s no Wi-Fi in the parking-lot drive-up location you’ve picked. Processing tests is a very different enterprise. It is exacting. Most diagnostic tests are performed by putting a sample into a device and getting a result. But large-scale molecular diagnostic testing—in which segments of genetic material are read—isn’t done with off-the-shelf kits; these are laboratory-developed tests, meaning that running them is less like operating an appliance than like doing a procedure, with multiple steps requiring precision and tight controls. The basic coronavirus PCR test starts with a reduction process—a series of steps to wash the specimen from the swab, inactivate any virus present, and separate out the genetic material (both human and viral). What arrives at the lab as a six-inch specimen tube of material is reduced, by means of chemical reagents and various machines, to a few extracted drops of nucleic acids. Then comes the viral-detection phase. Enzymes and probes—special stretches of DNA—are added that, under the right conditions, recognize and bind to sars-CoV-2 RNA. (The genome of coronaviruses is made of RNA, not DNA.) The binding of a probe triggers a reaction that creates a DNA transcription of the viral RNA template. That enables the final steps: the signalling process. The mixture is now put into a PCR machine—in essence, a tiny oven that sequentially heats and cools the mixture to precise temperatures, triggering further reactions that generate new copies of the viral genetic material. Each cycle of heating and cooling doubles the number of copies. After thirty cycles, up to a billion copies of viral DNA are produced from each strand. A separate marker in the mix recognizes the DNA and releases a fluorescent dye that can be measured by an optical device in the machine; there’s a threshold above which the test is considered positive. The result is checked by a technician and released electronically back to the test site. Although labs are constantly making improvements to this chain of steps in order to increase efficiency and accuracy, the whole process, from receiving a sample at a lab to sending a result, typically takes between six and twelve hours. Running a clinical laboratory in the United States requires making the entire collecting and processing operation run smoothly. That’s why testing here is dominated by such a small number of national laboratories. The big four commercial labs are really logistics and distribution companies wrapped around a network of regional laboratories. That’s also what makes them a chokepoint. As Quest and LabCorp have both warned, they do not have the ability to expand their systems quickly enough to meet current needs, let alone meet the demands that will come with flu season. Yet we have other laboratories with large amounts of untapped processing capacity ready to provide next-day results. In July, for instance, I visited the Broad Institute, a large academic laboratory affiliated with M.I.T. and Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has provided coronavirus testing for area hospitals, clinics, and others. As Sheila Dodge, the senior director of Broad Genomics, explained as she walked me through its molecular-testing operation, they had the capacity to process up to thirty-five thousand tests per day. With a few weeks’ notice, they could expand that to a hundred thousand a day—more than fifteen per cent of the nation’s current capacity. But, when I visited, they were receiving just a few thousand test specimens per day. I saw an entire room of machines standing by, mostly idle. It’s the same story elsewhere. I spoke to leaders at the University of Minnesota’s Genomics Center, who reported that they have unused capacity to deliver up to twenty-five thousand tests a day. And there are numerous other university-based and independent molecular-diagnostics laboratories with the ability to expand the country’s testing capacity. Several companies—including Guardant Health and Helix, in California; Kailos Genetics, in Alabama; and Ginkgo Bioworks, in Boston—are rolling out advanced molecular-testing techniques that could enable them to collectively process hundreds of thousands of tests a day. Whereas the usual charge for test processing is a hundred dollars or more, most of these labs are willing to charge much less—from fifty dollars to as little as twenty dollars. What’s missing is the logistics operation to connect their supply of tests to the people who need them and to the entities that pay for them. These remarkable scientific enterprises aren’t sitting on their hands. Each is making a herculean effort to connect to places seeking tests, one by one. The Broad Institute has built support for more than a hundred area colleges. Nonetheless, the labs are connected to only a fraction of those they could serve. Decades ago, electric companies were organized in the same way that laboratory testing is organized today. They were vertical monopolies that ran their own power plants, transmission lines, and customer operations. That arrangement got the job done, but it meant that many communities endured brownouts and blackouts from a shortage of capacity, while others had an oversupply. And the companies impeded innovation such as cleaner and cheaper energy. The creation of a national electric grid that physically connected the electricity supply, plus the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which required transmission-line owners to allow electric-generation companies access to their power lines, opened the door for load balancing, increased supply, lower costs, and alternative energy production. We have no national grid for the generation, transmission, or distribution of our testing supply—or, for that matter, the supply of ventilators, masks, intensive-care beds, or almost any other health-care resources. Now we’re paying the price. In power generation, the worry is that our national grid is aging; in health care, the worry is that we have no grid at all. To see what a functional national grid can deliver when it comes to public health, consider South Korea. It supported test collection, test processing, and the connections between them. On January 27th, when the country had seen just three confirmed covid-19 cases, officials from Korea’s equivalents to the C.D.C. and F.D.A. held an urgent meeting with clinical laboratories and medical manufacturers, telling them to develop PCR tests for the new coronavirus spreading out of control in China, and to coördinate manufacturing swabs, reagents, and other necessary supplies. The government created an accelerated authorization process. By February 4th, one lab had isolated viral specimens from the three cases and reproduced the genetic material from them. Government scientists had varying dilutions put into test plates and delivered to participating laboratories as a kind of final exam for their molecular tests. If a laboratory correctly identified all the positives and negatives, its test was approved. By February 6th, the South Korean government had validated and approved tests from forty-six laboratories. Afterward, it carried out periodic cross-checks to make sure that testing remained accurate. At the same time, the government coördinated with hospitals, clinics, and public-health agencies to set up test sites, agreeing to cover the testing costs for patients (at a flat rate of sixty-seven dollars a test), and creating a common scheduling system. (Dial 1339 from anywhere in the country and you can schedule a test nearby that day.) That scheduling system also allowed them to balance the testing loads, connecting laboratories that had extra capacity to test sites where that capacity was needed. Today, South Korea, with as many people as Florida and Texas combined, has some six hundred test sites, served by a hundred and eighteen authorized laboratories, with, typically, a one-day turnaround time. That’s what a grid can get you. Other countries followed South Korea’s example. We never did. In fact, the United States has stymied rather than accelerated the ability of laboratories to develop testing capacity. In the labs of my hospital system, the Mass General Brigham—as in other academic and commercial labs—scientists began developing a coronavirus test in January, concerned that the outbreak in Asia could become a danger here. But, through February, the F.D.A. authorized only the C.D.C.’s coronavirus test. On February 20th, the Department of Health and Human Services sent out an e-mail blast to labs nationwide summarizing the Administration’s policy. It is a stunning document. It stated that the C.D.C. had the only authorized test protocol in the country, and that only it and select state and local public-health laboratories could use it. Other clinical laboratories were supposed to send their patients’ swabs to an already backlogged C.D.C. Not only did the notice provide no encouragement for laboratories to develop tests; it actually blocked one of the principal means for labs to do so, declaring that “clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens” collected from patients thought to be infected. Neal Lindeman, the head of my hospital’s molecular-testing laboratory, could only shake his head as he read the notice. “I thought it was foolish and dangerous,” he said. “I decided to ignore the e-mail. I didn’t think this plan was going to work for the country. So we just continued working on our test in the background.” And, as became widely known, the C.D.C.’s plan did not work; its test kit had contaminated probes, and its protocol was flawed. The virus spread undetected nationwide for a month while we delivered hardly any tests at all. On February 29th, the F.D.A. finally reversed course, announcing that laboratories could develop and deploy their own coronavirus testing programs, so long as they also applied for emergency authorization from the agency. But, unlike its Korean counterpart, it provided no plan to streamline the test-authorization process. On the contrary, the agency made clear that it was not enough for a laboratory to show that its test yielded accurate results on blinded specimens. A detailed review of protocols would be required as well. Even slight deviations from the C.D.C.’s protocol required the laboratory to submit a separate “bridging study”—a term that had not been defined. Nor did the F.D.A. have enough experts to do the detailed review the agency required. The result: F.D.A. reviews took far too long. Furthermore, when a lab made improvements in its process—or adjustments to circumvent shortages in supplies—it had to return to petition for authorization all over again. The uncertainty about whether applications would succeed naturally made labs hesitate to make the investment necessary to scale up their operations. We’ve needed a speedier process, but we still also need the government to set and insure consistent standards. The F.D.A’s validation protocol needed reforming, not eliminating. So even some F.D.A. critics were shocked when, this August, in a barely reported move, the Trump Administration announced that lab-developed tests would no longer require F.D.A. review. This could open the door to tests with insufficient scientific oversight and yet more confusion for patients. Even with the substantial capacity of F.D.A.-authorized coronavirus tests that we’ve already accumulated, the government launched no major effort to balance testing loads among them. There is still unmet demand and untapped capacity. At the same time, we are undersupplied with test centers. And we have no defined approach at all for some hundred million essential workers, students, and others who need access to assurance testing that health-care plans won’t pay for. Conservatives have long opposed the government’s playing a direct role in addressing major gaps in the supply of health-care services. A third of U.S. counties have no childbirth facilities, and shortages of psychiatric beds are even worse. So maybe we should not be surprised that we have no such system for testing. It’s not just that we lack a national grid; we haven’t even agreed that we need one. Will improvements in techniques and technologies get us out of our testing debacle? They can help a lot—but only if we fix the underlying problem we have with delivery. Consider, for instance, pooled testing, in which you combine samples from a group of people in a single tube for a test run. A negative result will clear the entire group. If a tube comes up positive, you go back to the original samples and run them individually. During the Second World War, draftees were screened for syphilis through pooled testing. The Red Cross has used the technique to screen donated blood since 1999. In May, the Chinese government used the technique to screen the entire city of Wuhan, testing more than nine million people in ten days. (Just three hundred tests came back positive.) Pooled testing is useful when you’re screening lots of healthy people for an uncommon disease and you don’t have enough testing machines or reagents. But we’ve made no commitment to setting up the systems required to physically screen large numbers of healthy people at scale—and pooling doesn’t work if you can’t collect the specimens to pool. In communities where disease rates are high, meanwhile, pooling isn’t so valuable: too many tests will come back positive, which slows the whole production line down to a crawl. Plus, the approach doesn’t do anything about bringing online unused lab capacity, which would be needed to deploy any testing strategy efficiently. Sewage testing, one type of pooled testing, has real potential as a means of cost-efficient, large-scale screening. People infected with sars-CoV-2 shed the virus in their stool, and PCR testing of wastewater can detect the virus upward of four days before people typically obtain clinical testing. Several hundred communities have partnered with companies such as Biobot, a Boston-area startup, to monitor viral prevalence in their populations, and the C.D.C. has announced a National Wastewater Surveillance System to track the information. The technique could be especially useful when deployed in an institutional setting: for instance, to clear a nursing home or dormitory with a single daily PCR test. The University of Arizona prevented an outbreak when regular testing of sewage samples from twenty campus buildings turned up traces of the virus from a dormitory; swab-testing the three hundred and eleven residents the next day identified two with infections. The lower limit of detection still needs to be confirmed, but Biobot claims its system can pick up a single case in up to sixty-five-hundred people. And it’s comparatively cheap: the primary cost is installing a twenty-four-hour sampling system into a building’s wastewater outflow. But, again, the mere existence of the capability is not enough. Coördinated efforts and investment are required to deploy it. The supply of compositors, the sampling devices required, must be secured. And then you need a system to provide swift follow-up testing of individuals when a sewage test comes back positive. What about at-home test collection? The F.D.A. has authorized a small number of companies—for example, LabCorp and the startup Everlywell—to give people home collection kits with specific, preapproved instructions for swabbing themselves or providing a saliva sample. Unsupervised self-collection can result in higher rates of missed infections, to be sure. And delivering and returning the tests by mail can add a couple of days to the testing process—although, as more labs gain approval for unsupervised collection kits, one can imagine pharmacies, workplaces, and schools facilitating pickup and drop-off sites that could speed it up. If we haven’t addressed the demand-capacity mismatch, however, the approach could still be slowed by lab-processing backups. You could circumvent the lab bottleneck by means of tabletop “point of care” machines that can run sars-CoV-2 tests in clinics and other authorized settings without specialized personnel. They’re a marvel of miniaturization—akin to having your own electric generator. The White House uses these devices to test staff and visitors. There are versions that can run a PCR test in less than forty-five minutes. For those who have the money, such machines provide a means to buy your way around our broken system. But demand for the devices and the cartridges they require has far outpaced manufacturing capacity. Because each tabletop device can typically run only one sample at a time, the technology is at best a partial solution for getting to the millions of low-cost tests we need per day—there’s a difference between a Xerox machine and a printing plant. To deploy these devices, the country would still need a focussed national effort to boost the supply and get it to the populations that most need them. A cheaper type of point-of-care test has emerged that takes just fifteen minutes. Unlike PCR tests, which detect the virus’s nucleic acids, this is an “antigen” test, which detects the virus’s proteins. Most involve machines. But the Abbott antigen test card, which has just come on the market, uses the same technology as home pregnancy tests and costs labs just five dollars. It embeds a filter-paper-like strip with antibodies that trigger the release of a dye and make a line appear when they recognize and bind to sars-CoV-2 proteins. The test is said to be almost as sensitive as PCR tests, but it has only been formally tested with (and authorized for) symptomatic patients. For people without symptoms, antigen tests are significantly less sensitive. The Abbott test card is still complex enough that it requires laboratory certification and a trained health-care worker to use it. But, with no machine needed, it’s easier to manufacture these tests at scale. The federal government has committed to buying a hundred and fifty million of these tests. How they’ll be distributed is unknown, however. With no grid to monitor need and link it with supply, distribution in this Administration has been left to the vagaries of political favor. Simpler paper-strip antigen tests are in development that people can administer at home. They’d likely have yet lower sensitivity. But false negatives can be reduced by repeat testing—and that’s possible, because they’re cheap and fast. Advocates imagine people having a pack of strips at home and testing themselves every day or two in order to provide assurance for their school or workplace. The weakness of antigen testing is not just its miss rate but also its rate of false positives. Two to three per cent of people without covid-19 nonetheless turn up positive with these tests, unlike with PCR testing. The antibodies that these tests use to recognize and attach to sars-CoV-2 proteins can also bind to unrelated proteins and cellular material. A quick, cheap test at the airport before you board a flight with a hundred other people sounds great. At present rates, one passenger might actually be unknowingly infected with the virus—current assurance-testing programs commonly find infection rates at or below one per cent. But two to three other uninfected passengers are likely to have a false positive result, be prohibited from boarding, and have to quarantine in whatever city they are in until they’re cleared by PCR testing. Today, most positive antigen tests will be false—an outcome that could prove untenable in many situations and inspire mistrust in the tests. There are paper-strip molecular assays in development that, promising both precision and speed, could have the greatest transformative potential of any test. They recognize viral genetic material, typically using crispr-based technology, and are expected to avoid the false-positive problem of antigen tests. James Collins, an M.I.T. professor of biomedical engineering, is leading a team that, going a step yet further, is developing a face mask with a crispr-based sensor that signals if you develop a sars-CoV-2 infection. We are on our way to an emporium of testing technologies. The trouble is that none of them will allow us to get around the necessity to upgrade and simplify our system for securing public health. Home-use paper-strip technologies have not yet received F.D.A. authorization. It will be months more before they can be produced in mass quantities. And, again, technologies do not implement themselves: we have to make sure that people actually have the tests in hand, that they won’t run out of them in hot-spot communities, that public-health authorities are notified when tests are positive, that positive cases get confirmatory tests and self-isolate, and that their contacts are traced and tested, too. If the development of essential technologies requires effort, skill, and investment, so does the delivery of them. There are places in the country that have recognized that reality. San Francisco, one of the first American cities to be hit by the pandemic, has also been one of the best at curbing it. A big reason was Mayor London Breed’s decision, starting on March 6th, less than twenty-four hours after seeing the city’s first two confirmed cases, to back the aggressive recommendations of her city’s public-health director, Grant Colfax, to halt large gatherings, suspend nonessential travel, explore work-from-home options, and rapidly deploy a citywide testing program that remains one of the country’s most effective. San Francisco’s leaders recognized the importance of universally available testing; residents needed to have an easy way to get tested regardless of what insurance they had or didn’t have, regardless of what relationship they had or didn’t have with a clinic, and regardless of whether or not they had a doctor’s order. The city’s hospitals, labs, and clinics were not going to meet that need, because that isn’t their job. In America, health-care systems are responsible for the care of individuals, not communities. So the city’s public-health department decided to step in. It took an approach that resembles South Korea’s. Officials worked with local providers and laboratories to establish a network of free drive-through and walk-in sites, open to anyone who lives or works in the city. The city established a scheduling system, which people could access online or by phone, and outreach testing for nursing homes and other vulnerable communities. Public-health officers signed standing orders for each site, eliminating the need for a doctor’s referral. The city negotiated and paid most test costs. And officials made sure that they could enlist a network of labs to provide adequate capacity and keep turnaround time low. They established, in effect, a public option for testing. Although there are scores of other test sites provided by hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the city, the CityTest SF network has accounted for two-thirds of the city’s daily volume of tests. The program has literally been a lifesaver. Elsewhere in California, places like Los Angeles have exploded with covid-19 cases. San Francisco has kept the coronavirus contained. All this, alas, makes San Francisco an anomaly. Historically, the work of public health has been separate from the work of health-care delivery, using measures outside the medical system to address controllable diseases like cholera, tuberculosis, and food poisoning. But even before the coronavirus crisis hit, the separation was making less and less sense. A wide range of diseases are now controllable with the modern tools of diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. As the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, the population-level distribution of medical tests, ventilators, and drugs matters as much to disease control as nonmedical measures such as masks and social distancing. Success requires integrating the systems focussed on individual care and those focussed on community needs. We’ve long resisted that integration, though. The clearest indication is how we’ve spent our money. Spending per person on medical care was seventy-nine hundred dollars per American in 2008; it climbed to an estimated eleven thousand six hundred dollars in 2019. By contrast, the average spending per person allocated to state and local health departments was a measly eighty dollars per person in 2008, and fell to fifty-six dollars in 2019. Public-health agencies that are supposed to look after communities’ health have been forced to expand tattoo-parlor inspections while shrinking their programs to assure adequate maternal- and child-health services or screen for chronic illnesses like high blood pressure and diabetes. Talk to city and state officials about what San Francisco accomplished, and you typically hear: “Just can’t do it.” So how has San Francisco been able to pull it off? In part, it’s because the last deadly pandemic it experienced—the H.I.V./aids crisis—taught the city that public health and medical care must work together. San Francisco has been a pioneer in guaranteeing that H.I.V. testing and treatment is readily available and affordable to all residents in need. Those reflexes, and the associated budgeting commitment, served the city well when the coronavirus arrived. Some cities and even states—including Los Angeles, Illinois, Maine, and Tennessee—have created versions of San Francisco’s free coronavirus-testing model; the federal government set up test sites, too. Those sites received large numbers of people. But most programs don’t have sufficient funding to open enough sites—Illinois has only eleven, for instance—and the federal government opened just forty-one locations nationwide, most of which it shut down by the end of June, despite the accelerating spread of the disease. Some cities and states have run testing “blitzes,” providing public-sponsored, pop-up testing sites for a few days, with no scheduling required. But, again, because there isn’t the funding to open enough sites, lines are typically long. As cases spiked in July, almost a thousand people waited up to thirteen hours at such a site in Phoenix. Nor have these states created a system to shift testing loads to labs with capacity the way San Francisco did. A serious national strategy for coronavirus testing—including universally available assurance testing for essential workers, travellers, students, and others—is clearly needed. Such a strategy would entail a major injection of funding, which would pay for itself many times over by getting the pandemic response, and therefore the economy, back on track. It would have the F.D.A. supervise the validation process for laboratory tests, but with a simplified and speeded-up process. And it would build our national grid for monitoring, distributing, and accelerating testing capacity, whatever technologies emerge. President Trump, backed by the Republican politicians who have protected him, is clearly uninterested in pursuing such goals. But even the most committed Administration would have struggled to overcome the effects of the long, collective neglect of our public-health systems. Hospitals and clinics have had the resources to spend tens of billions of dollars installing electronic medical-record systems. A whole industry has developed to deliver such capabilities. Yet our thinly staffed public-health departments, which are expected to compile thousands of diagnostic-test results per day and follow up on outbreaks, have nothing of the kind. Some still receive test results by fax and must manually enter them into databases. They lack the means to readily measure, let alone manage, a community’s availability of coronavirus tests, ventilators, hospital beds, or personal protective equipment. Not a single state in the country reports coronavirus-test turnaround time and rates of mask wearing—two of our most critical indicators for shutting the virus down. They’d like to; they just don’t have the ability to collect the information. The pandemic has given us all a master class on infectious disease, diagnostics, and the reality that individual health is inseparable from community health. Polling shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans want the government to cover the costs of not only testing but also treatment for the coronavirus. In turn, support has grown for expanding Medicare to cover all Americans for their medical needs, and for investment in public health. Epidemiologists expect us to encounter one of the worst falls and winters in American history. We will have more American dead in a single year from the pandemic than we saw during any year of war we’ve faced. On Election Day, we’ll have a chance to turn out a President who has sacrificed tens of thousands of American lives—and undermined essential government institutions—to serve his own desires. And yet, amid the carnage, there’s a lot we can still do to advance the essential work of collaboration. In New England, for example, the Assurance Testing Alliance (of which I am a founder) has been assembling a logistics grid that links schools, nursing homes, and other institutions that need regular testing to those who have the capacity to deliver it. Already, the alliance has pushed the total cost of a PCR test to fifty dollars, with a next-day turnaround time. And, beginning in August, and catalyzed by a Rockefeller Foundation effort, ten governors (so far) have formed an interstate compact to purchase and distribute enough rapid-testing devices and supplies for the delivery of five million tests. This compact enables what you’d think the United States government was created to provide: a confederation of states working to meet their common needs. Participating states share and coördinate their testing capacity, rather than bidding against one another, as they did in order to procure scarce ventilators and P.P.E. earlier in the pandemic. Alternative infrastructures like this will prove all the more important if Trump continues to control the federal government. Such efforts aren’t a replacement for national leadership, but they start the work that must be done to make ordinary physical interaction safe again, and to begin creating the public-health system we deserve. As the former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop once said, “Health care is vital to all of us some of the time, but public health is vital to all of us all of the time.” The pandemic has brought Americans a further lesson: our best chance for long, flourishing lives in the future requires that we build the foundations of our public health now.

A Weekend of Anger and Defiance Across New York City,20572,"On Friday evening, a local manifestation of the nationwide protests against police brutality, sparked by the killing of George Floyd, in Minneapolis, began at the Barclays Center, in Brooklyn, around six. According to photographs widely shared on social media, hundreds of cops had begun gathering there in the late afternoon, standing in formation across the front entrance of the arena. As anyone who has ever gone to a march or demonstration in New York City will know, the N.Y.P.D. excels at crowd control, at corralling groups into smaller groups, and slowly dismantling those groups until the protest is diminished. To protest in the city is usually to navigate a maze of metal barricades with obscure entry and exit points. By the time I arrived, around 8 p.m., the plaza between the arena and the entrance to the Atlantic Avenue subway station had been cleared of people and barricaded off—a process that, as videos posted online revealed, had involved knocking people down, pepper-spraying, and making dozens of arrests. A crowd of a few hundred people remained on the sidewalks on either side of Atlantic Avenue. In between them was the territory of dozens of police officers, who were milling around and loading arrested protesters onto M.T.A. buses. This made for surreal reënactments of the crowded rush hours that no longer exist—one bus was full only of police officers; in another, all the passengers were arrested protesters, with officers hanging from the rails, overseeing them. (The president of the Transit Workers’ Union soon voiced an official objection to the practice.) As for social distancing: there was no social distancing. There were officers in blue shirts, and sergeants in white shirts; there were suit-and-tie cops, cops in black windbreakers that said police across the front and nypd legal on the back. There were undercover cops in plain clothes that looked ersatz, like the female officer in a T-shirt, jeans, and out-of-season L.L. Bean-style duck boots; another wore a shiny patterned do-rag for which he was heckled, because he was not black. There were very few black police officers on duty. One was the target of particular vitriol from a cluster of protesters, who chanted, “They don’t give a fuck about you.” She stared back at them, gloved hands on her belt, head tilted in an attitude of bored annoyance, chewing gum behind her mask. The sidewalk in front of Shake Shack, spray-painted with social-distancing guidelines, was now crowded with people. They chanted “Breonna Taylor” and “Say her name” in a call-and-response with demonstrators on the other side of Atlantic Avenue. Most looked to be under thirty. They were black, brown, and white, male, female, and nonbinary. Some seemed to be experienced activists, wearing black and holding quarts of milk in readiness for the next round of pepper spray. Others, stylish and unflappable, looked barely older than the New Yorkers one might see at a slice shop when high school lets out. The drawl of Bobby Shmurda, a rapper from Flatbush, played from a speaker, and a few protesters danced. Most carried no signage, or just a simple “Black Lives Matter” on a piece of brown cardboard. They wore face masks. Some but not all of the police wore masks, too, and those who didn’t were singled out by protesters chanting, “Wear a mask.” The violence came in small flurries, the calm broken whenever the police decided to disperse the protesters further. Let May 29th be remembered as the day the New York City Police Department slowly cleared a few feet of sidewalk in front of the shiny glass walls of the Atlantic Avenue Chick-Fil-A. The cycle would begin with bike-patrol officers using their bikes, held end to end, to push against the demonstrators who faced them. An officer would repeat, like a mantra, the directive “Move back.” The protesters would chant, “You move back.” A few cries would ring out: “This is a public sidewalk” or “We have a right to be here!” Then the police would make their move: pushing forward, pepper-spraying, dragging people who resisted into their ranks to get zip-tied as the protesters screamed things like “Don’t push her” or “Don’t punch him.” The well-placed shove, as documented in a widely shared video in which an officer can be seen knocking a twenty-year-old protester named Dounya Zayer to the ground, was a common strategy. Zayer suffered a seizure in the aftermath of the shove, and, earlier in the evening, the crowd had watched in silence as, semiconscious but with her winged eyeliner still perfect, she was wheeled into an ambulance. A friend, Whitney Hu, had walked alongside her, saying, “Excuse me”—and, in response to the question on everyone’s mind, “A cop pushed her.” “This is the New York City Police Department,” an amplified, disembodied male voice repeated. “You are unlawfully obstructing pedestrian traffic. You are ordered to disperse now to resume the safe flow of pedestrian traffic.” The pedestrians were at home, scrolling on their phones, watching Minneapolis burn down. “Suck my dick—how ’bout that? How ’bout that?” a black woman in a camouflage jacket and glasses yelled, her hair tied up in a scarf. “Y’all supposed to be protecting me. Nobody give a fuck about us, but we got to listen to y’all. ‘Move back, do this, do that.’ ” Her voice broke, and her invective dissolved into a series of long, wordless screams. “Let it out,” a friend said, putting his body between her and the police, facing her, looking into her eyes, holding her arms. By 10 p.m., the last group of protesters on Atlantic was pushed past the going-out-of-business signs in the windows of Modell’s Sporting Goods, but small clusters still roamed the neighborhood, and a police car was set on fire next to Fort Greene Park. I biked east to the Eighty-eighth Precinct, in Bed-Stuy, on a tip from an observer who saw my press pass. “I work for the city—don’t tell anyone,” he said, with an air of conspiracy, and gave me the address. The brownstone-lined streets of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill were dark and deserted. Signs of the path of the demonstrators would periodically appear—garbage bags ripped open; an abandoned M.T.A. bus, its length spray-painted with the words “say their names.” At Classon and Greene, a line of officers stood before the shell of a wrecked police van facing a group of thirty or forty demonstrators who were shouting at them, some with their arms raised, moving out of the way of cars that continued passing through the intersection. One car, an unmarked black sedan, pausing at the stop sign, blipped its siren and flashed its lights. An object bounced off its roof. “That was a brick,” a protester on the sidewalk said, in a flat tone of neutral observation. A few minutes later, the police took out their nightsticks and suddenly rushed. The protesters, most of them standing on Classon, turned toward Greene, running up the sidewalk where I stood. I should have abandoned the Citibike I was holding and followed them. Instead I tried to turn the heavy bike on its axis, which is a little like trying to reverse the course of a container ship. As the protesters fled, I was left amid a swarm of angry officers in visors and helmets. I tried to shrink against the metal pole of a street sign. A plainclothes officer in a T-shirt stopped, took a look at me, and, with great efficiency, doubled back and shoved me to the ground. The next day, in Harlem, the clouds were marshmallow white and the sun shone over the plaza in front of the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., state office building at 125th Street, where, at one in the afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators streamed in to gather around the statue of Powell, the state’s first black member of the House of Representatives. The day before, Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, had been charged with third-degree murder. The protesters were not satisfied. “First degree, not third degree!” they shouted. As before, the crowd was multiracial and young, although there were a few more people over forty, and even a few small children. Two people in light blue medical scrubs held a sign that read “Healthcare Workers Against Police Brutality.” The night before, Mayor Bill de Blasio had said, “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” That day, perhaps because of his message, or because of the political power of Harlem, the visible police presence was smaller. A dozen or so officers, spaced apart, stood at the entrance of the office building. The demonstrators policed themselves, more or less, waving people off the street to maintain the flow of traffic. The memory of the night before dissipated, and a sense of exhilaration at the gathering of hundreds of people on a beautiful spring Saturday after how many days of social distancing—seventy? eighty?—was undeniable, the anger and risk notwithstanding. The protest was barely thirty minutes old when a majority contingent began marching south down Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, walking at a New Yorker’s clip along multiple city blocks. A driver of a Farmland Fresh dairy truck on the northbound side honked to applause; fists were raised through sunroofs; a UPS deliveryman in his brown uniform recorded video on the sidewalk, smiling under his sun visor; a family banged on pots and pans from an upstairs window. “These people, they’ve had enough,” I heard a bystander say, as she recorded the march on her phone. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Unearthing Black History at the Freedom Lots The march passed the shuttered stores of Harlem—flower shops, laundromats, Ateliers DuBois antiques—the demonstrators happily chanting, “N.Y.P.D., suck my dick.” Any members of the police on hand to hear this kept themselves scarce. At 116th Street, the protesters paused for a moment and knelt, fists raised. A helicopter hovered overhead, but, as the marchers reached F.D.R. Drive, the sun glittering off the East River, they broke into a run of jubilation. The police closed in at the Ninety-sixth Street exit, a line of bicycles blocking the way on the southbound side. The protesters at the front clashed with them in a flurry of pepper-spraying, shoving, punching, screaming, and zip-tying, arrested protesters shouting out their mothers’ phone numbers as they were dragged into vans, while others scattered at a run. The march fell apart, despite shouted pleas to stay together. A small remainder of a hundred or so people retreated from the highway and gathered under some scaffolding next to a gas station. A young man climbed the scaffold to give a speech. He was black, small, and slight, and wore his hair tied up in a poofy ponytail. He had round gold-framed glasses, pants emblazoned with the nasa logo, and a T-shirt with the words “Speak Out or Shut Up.” The group now had a de-facto leader, and he happened to have a sense of style. He said we could call him Tito. Now Tito reminded everyone of the importance of not scattering at the first sign of police. “Make a friend,” he said, hanging off the scaffolding. “They’re your new brother and sister, new uncle and aunt. Grab their information.” The group, which had seemed on the verge of dissipating, found a renewed sense of purpose. “Remember to be like water, be like water, and follow what they do in Hong Kong and all the other countries. Organize,” he continued. “When they try to block us, we turn the corner.” “Where we going?” someone asked. “I don’t know. We gotta figure that out.” And so the march continued into the heart of the leafy, shuttered, and depopulated Upper East Side, where the drivers who were made to halt looked on with the stone-faced not-seeing that New Yorkers reserve for displays of evangelism on the subway. The marchers passed a person walking a poodle, and a young woman whose velvety Scottish Fold cat glared from her purse. Solitary elders, trapped in their apartments by the coronavirus, gazed down from terraces in bemusement or longing. A hush hung over the leafy side streets, a few masked doormen waving in support from behind glass entryways. “Park Avenue! Wonderful!” one demonstrator, the oldest among them, said with a sigh, as they turned onto its immaculate expanse, its medians blooming with flowers. But the cops were waiting there, and arrested one protester who expressed herself too defiantly. Another, in jeans shorts and a bikini top, came to her defense and got arrested, too. But the group knew now not to break apart. The protesters went around the corner and continued east. Pale children gazed out from behind windows, next to rainbow-painted signs that read “Stay Strong” and “Stay Positive.” At intersections, the police bike patrol could be seen travelling in parallel two blocks south, its yellow safety gear flashing. On the shady steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tito stood before the group. “Take a seat on the steps. Get a little rest,” he said, ignoring an older white man wearing loafers without socks and pink chino shorts taking photographs with his phone. Tito announced that the goal would be to walk to Union Square, where more protesters were gathered. It was up to individual protesters to make their own decisions about whether to press on, but, as he put it, “We got nowhere else to go! It’s quarantine right now. We lost everything.” He went on, “I lost three of my family members, lost my businesses. I’m broke as shit. I lost my car that I drive illegally because my registration expired and I don’t give a fuck.” There was laughter from the protesters. “We are blessed to be alive,” he said. “A lot of us don’t have moms or dads or families at all. Right now we are each other’s moms, dads, sisters, brothers, cousins, all that. We are here for a reason. This is a reason right now.” If the unemployed youth of New York City have found purpose in protest, it’s going to be a long summer for the N.Y.P.D. And so they continued past Central Park, then down Madison Avenue, where the police melted away again, presumably because the street was utterly deserted. The Balenciaga and Celine boutiques gleamed, their shelves emptied of wares. A lone female security guard in uniform on a street corner clapped as a chant of “N.Y.P.D., K.K.K., how many kids did you kill today?” echoed off the skyscrapers. M.T.A. bus drivers tooted their horns. Starbucks employees danced and cheered in the window. At one intersection, a driver, who was black, honked in impatience. “Don’t be stupid. We’re protesting for you!” one of the marchers shouted at him. “I’m not stupid—that’s why I’m not protesting” was his retort out the window. “Well,” someone observed, eyeing his plates, “he’s from Jersey.” Just south of Madison Square Park, the group paused to rest again. “This is ours,” Tito said of the block; the street had been blocked off in a social-distancing measure. He stood up on a bench to deliver a more personal pep talk. He was thirty, from Washington Heights, and had survived cancer as a small child. At school, he had participated in an outreach program called N.Y.P.D. Explorers, a kind of R.O.T.C. for the police force, where he had learned all about the different branches of the service and visited many precincts. In 2014, he said, a group of police, acting on what he described as a false accusation, beat him up and stole his wallet, landing him in the hospital with a permanent injury to his back, and P.T.S.D. Two weeks after his release, Eric Garner was killed on Staten Island, and Tito had been protesting ever since. He did seem to know a lot about the cops: at one point in the speech, he encouraged the group to wave at two men leaning against a building halfway down the block. The group cheered and waved. After some hesitation, the two men waved back. They had been with us all along. As the Harlem protesters made their way through Manhattan, other protests had begun: at Diversity Plaza, in Jackson Heights, Queens; at the Hub, in the South Bronx; and at the intersection of Parkside and Ocean Avenues, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Reports of police brutality in Flatbush, where thousands of people ended up gathering, started appearing on social media by late afternoon. By the time I arrived at the intersection of Flatbush and Church Avenues, just before eight in the evening, the protesters had splintered into factions that were roaming around the neighborhood. One small group, of a hundred or so, was marching north up Flatbush Avenue—the same group, I assume, that two N.Y.P.D. vehicles appeared to nearly plow through a few minutes later. (“It’s inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” de Blasio wrote in a tweet. “That’s wrong on its face, and that hasn’t happened in the history of protest in NYC.”) Another group remained stationary at the intersection of Bedford and Snyder, a block and a half from the Sixty-seventh Precinct, where protesters and cops engaged in a seemingly endless series of skirmishes. As I arrived, a fire engine was leaving, having just extinguished another blazing patrol car, and someone was posing for a photo holding a “Fuck White Supremacy” sign. Police officers stood in lines blocking the intersection, fighting and making arrests whenever a water bottle or traffic cone was lobbed their way, which was not infrequently. The mood was volatile, the protesters better equipped and more determined than the evening before. Small brigades of demonstrators stood ready to treat comrades who got pepper-sprayed. I watched, trying not to think of the virus, as a man knelt before three or four protesters, lifting his face to be misted and then wiping his streaming eyes with his hands. In the middle of all of this, at one corner of the intersection, the Byways and Hedges Youth Ministry had seen an unprecedented opportunity to deliver the message of the Lord to the masses, and had parked an open-sided red trailer from which uplifting gospel music echoed over the scene. A pastor with a Jamaican accent spoke into a microphone before an American flag, intoning words of hope and salvation—resulting in the kind of uncanny juxtaposition of violence and messianic aesthetics that, in a Hollywood movie, would seem entirely overwrought. “This Earth may vanish, this Earth may vanish, remember to . . . maintain social distance,” the preacher crooned, to bitter laughter from the crowd. The battle over these few feet of Bedford Avenue went on for most of the night. Later, I watched as demonstrators dug up the rocks around the trees and threw them at the police vehicles that were making an attempt to cut off the street. (The police retreated.) Another police car peeled out of a driveway, inches from a group of distracted protesters. There was a dumpster fire (the dumpster belonged to a nearby Shell station), and a pitchfork held aloft—someone had found it at a work site. “Put that shit down—they’ll shoot your ass!” someone shouted. (The protester set it back down.) Every appearance by the F.D.N.Y. was celebrated with applause. An M.T.A. bus got stuck at a nearby intersection, its driver alternately flashing “emergency” and “call police” on the vehicle’s signs. The bus was ignored by the protesters, who instead chose another police car to set on fire. But, aside from the police property, the dumpster, and some graffiti, I saw no other property defaced. New York, unlike Minneapolis, was not yet ready to burn itself down. “Don’t be afraid,” the pastor said as a gospel chorus swelled through the speakers behind him. “God will carry you through.” The line of protesters moved forward, and the clashes began once again.

Who Gets to Vote in Florida?,56110,"Betty Riddle grew up in Sarasota, Florida, in a segregated neighborhood that people back in the nineteen-sixties called Black Bottom. She was raised by her mother, Idella, in a wooden house on Central Avenue. When she was twelve, Idella was murdered—“killed by a woman over a man,” Riddle recalled—and so she moved in with her aunt. Riddle learned early how to fight. When she was fifteen years old and seven months pregnant, she stabbed a taunting rival in the eye with a hooked knife. In 1975, Riddle was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, and given three years’ probation. After she had her baby, a daughter named Leola, she turned to drugs, especially crack cocaine. “I saw crack in everything,” she said. “Whatever I could sell, I sold.” She had another baby by another man, but mostly forgot about her children, resorting to robbery and prostitution to pay for crack. Riddle was in and out of prison, for drugs and for theft; she had two more babies by two more men. “Every boyfriend I ever had was a drug dealer,” she said. In 2002, she was sentenced to a fifth term—ten years this time, for selling cocaine. In the Gadsden Correctional Facility, in northern Florida, Riddle started listening to radio sermons by a pastor with a soothing voice. At first, the sermons were just a curiosity, something other inmates listened to, but after a time the pastor’s gentle prodding made her examine herself. “I was watching my kids have kids and visit me in prison,” she remembered. One day, while Riddle was writing a letter to her children, the pastor came on the radio with a new message. “God doesn’t change who you are,” he said. “He changes what you have become.” The words startled Riddle. “I put my pen down and said, Damn, that’s me. I was a good person, I used to be a leader, and I’ve become a drug addict. I’m tired of hurting my kids.” When Riddle got out, she and her daughter opened a food truck, called No Place Like Home, that served Southern cooking. She began attending classes in Bradenton, one county over, to earn a paralegal degree. Between working and studying, Riddle volunteered in the public defender’s office, where the staff knew her from her criminal days. “I’d cussed out the lawyers so bad, that’s why they remembered me,” she said. Now, though, the attorneys found that her patient manner put defendants at ease, and in 2016 the office hired her. She bought a house and a car. “I learned I can do anything if I put my mind to it,” she said. But one thing she could not do was vote. In 1877, after Reconstruction, legislators across the old Confederacy initiated a sweeping system of laws, known as Jim Crow, that made it virtually impossible for Black people to vote. From 1888 to 1968, not a single Black person was elected to the Florida legislature. The state’s constitution imposed an additional stricture: felons were banned for life from voting. The ban survived the dismantling of Jim Crow, in the nineteen-sixties and seventies. While many states imposed waiting periods and other restrictions on felons voting, Florida, along with a few other states, maintained a lifetime ban. Black people are arrested at disproportionate rates for felonies, especially drug-related ones; as recently as 2016, the ban disenfranchised one out of every five Black adults in the state. Desmond Meade, a former felon who had earned a law degree, launched a petition to abolish the voting prohibition on all but the most violent felons. Meade and his allies collected eight hundred thousand signatures, enough to put the question on a statewide ballot, in 2018, as Amendment Four. The campaign to encourage its passage began with volunteers painting logos on bedsheets, but it soon attracted significant funding, and in November the amendment was approved by nearly sixty-five per cent of Florida’s voters. As Meade told me, “White people, Black people, Republicans, Democrats—a whole bunch of conservatives supported us.” More than a million people who voted to elect the current governor, Ron DeSantis, an ally of President Trump, also supported the measure. Amendment Four represented the largest act of enfranchisement since 1971, when the Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age to eighteen. On March 17, 2020, the day of the Florida Presidential primary, Riddle rose at 6 a.m. and put on a T-shirt with an inscription that she’d devised: “First in Line, First Time Voting.” At the Robert L. Taylor Community Center, she signed her name to the voting roll and, at the age of sixty-two, cast her first ballot. “Like a gift from Heaven,” she said. But, after voting in the primary, Riddle may not be able to vote in the upcoming general election. Six months after Amendment Four passed, the Republican-dominated legislature approved a law dictating that ex-felons could vote only if they first paid all the fines, restitution, and fees imposed at their sentencing. The law may affect as many as seven hundred and seventy thousand Florida residents, about half of whom are Black. In many cases, the totals came to thousands of dollars. The burden was not just large but uncertain: state officials testified that they had no way of knowing how much money felons owe, or whether they have paid; those calculations would take six years or so to complete. The legislation gutted Amendment Four, but DeSantis claimed that he was merely enforcing the language that voters had approved. “The amendment does not apply to a felon who has failed to complete all the terms of his sentence,” he maintained. Riddle and sixteen other former felons sued DeSantis, arguing that the requirement amounted to a poll tax, which is prohibited by the Constitution. The case, filed with support from the A.C.L.U., became known as Jones v. DeSantis. In May, a federal judge ruled against DeSantis’s legislation, which he described as a “pay-to-vote system.” FEATURED VIDEO The Inside Story of California's 2018 Camp Fire DeSantis appealed, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to take up the case. The Eleventh Circuit Court is one of the country’s most conservative appellate panels. Two of the judges, Robert Luck and Barbara Lagoa, were DeSantis appointees, recently elevated from the Florida Supreme Court by President Trump. On that court, they had participated in oral arguments that resulted in an advisory decision supporting DeSantis’s view of Amendment Four. By legal custom, they should have recused themselves. They declined to do so, even after the ten sitting Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to remind them of the ethics breach. The decision to hear the case pushed any final resolution closer to the voter-registration deadline, on October 5th; even if the judgment goes in the felons’ favor, they will have to scramble to register. Until then, any convicted felon who wants to vote must first pay his fines—meaning, in all likelihood, that the overwhelming majority of them will sit out the November election. Riddle figures that her bill amounts to at least two thousand dollars. “I can’t pay,” she said. She told me that she wanted to address the Eleventh Circuit herself, in oral arguments, to explain what she believes to be the real motivation behind the new Florida law. “It’s not about the money,” she said. “Not all the Republicans are bad. But they don’t want us to vote. Because they think they’re going to lose.” For candidates in the coming Presidential election, Florida presents a singular opportunity and a vexing challenge. While other big states, such as Texas and California, reliably go to Republicans or Democrats, Florida is unpredictable. Polling suggests that Joe Biden could plausibly lose there and win the election, though the state’s twenty-nine electoral votes would surely make a victory easier; Trump, by most analyses, cannot win without them. Stretching eight hundred miles from end to end, Florida encompasses the Deep South counties of the panhandle and the urban centers of Miami, Palm Beach, and Fort Lauderdale, where Jewish and Latino voters predominate. There are growing Puerto Rican enclaves around Orlando, and main-line Republican areas in Naples and Tampa, linked demographically and culturally with the Midwest. This mixture creates an almost perfectly divided electorate. Statewide races are often decided by a few thousand votes, out of millions cast. Even though Florida is closely split, Republican leaders dominate state politics; since 1999, they have controlled both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. One key to their success has been restricting access to the polls. Lower turnout, particularly among Black voters, has usually favored their side. “Older and more affluent voters tend to be more conservative, and they tend to vote more often,” Daniel Smith, a professor of politics at the University of Florida, told me. That fact has motivated a relentless campaign to tamp down voter turnout. The most overt efforts were hindered by the Voting Rights Act, which until 2013 obligated places with a history of racial discrimination to get Justice Department approval before making major changes in electoral laws. But the less conspicuous efforts have had momentous effects. In 2000, they arguably helped decide the race for the Presidency. That year’s election, between George W. Bush and Al Gore, was the most bitterly contested in modern American history, a template for decades of partisan strife to come. Both candidates needed to win Florida, but the vote was too close to call, and the counting and recounting dragged on for thirty-five days. People argued over “hanging chads” (scraps of paper that clung to ballots that weren’t punched all the way through) and about “overvotes” (ballot designs that prompted voters to choose more than one candidate, disqualifying themselves). Amid the dispute, the former Nixon operative Roger Stone assembled Republican activists in Miami, to protest what he called a “left-wing power grab by Gore, the same way Fidel Castro did it in Cuba.” In what became known as the Brooks Brothers riot, the activists attempted to force their way into the office of the county’s election supervisor. The chaos subsided only when the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling along partisan lines, stopped the recount. Bush was awarded Florida’s electoral votes, and the Presidency. An official tally later showed that he had won the state by five hundred and thirty-seven votes. Gore had won the national popular vote by half a million. The scrutiny that followed focussed on Florida’s balloting problems. Another factor received far less attention: a Republican effort, beginning before the election, that prevented thousands of eligible voters from casting ballots. In the late nineties, after a scandal in which the ballots of about a hundred felons were counted in a Miami mayoral election, state officials began looking for a way to scour voter-registration records for felons. They hired a company called Database Technologies, which was founded by Hank Asher, a former cocaine smuggler and a self-taught computer entrepreneur who sometimes consulted with Rudolph Giuliani on anti-terrorist ventures. Database Technologies presented Florida officials with a choice: they could run a precisely focussed search or a broader one. “The state dictated to us that they wanted to go broader,” George Bruder, a D.B.T. executive, later testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “And we did it in the fashion that they requested.” Using the looser criteria, D.B.T. technicians compiled a list of approximately sixty thousand names. As the 2000 election approached, the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris sent lists of presumed felons to the supervisors of elections in the state’s sixty-seven counties, advising them to purge the names from voter rolls. In Leon County, Ion Sancho was skeptical. The list that he received enumerated nearly seven hundred suspected felons, and he doubted that his voter rolls contained so many. Looking more closely, he found that most of the names didn’t match. “We were being told to purge a voter named Johnston, even though the felon’s name was Johnson,” he told me. Fewer than forty turned out to be felons. The lists caused mayhem on Election Day. In some counties, many people who had never been convicted of anything discovered that they could not vote. Wallace McDonald, a commercial shrimp fisherman, went to his precinct, in Ybor City, in Tampa, as he had done for more than forty years. McDonald, who is Black, was told that he had been disqualified by an unspecified felony conviction. The son of a former New York City police officer, McDonald had once been rousted by cops in Jim Crow-era Tampa for sleeping on a public bench, but he’d never been convicted of a felony. He finally went home. “I was doing whatever I could do, and saying whatever I could say, but it didn’t make a bit of difference—I couldn’t vote,” McDonald, who is eighty-three, told me. Linda Howell, the supervisor of elections in Madison County, was notified that she herself was a convicted felon. Howell later gave indignant testimony about the state officials who had launched the purge: “The law said they had to verify this, but they were not taking it seriously—and that could destroy a person’s life. You get that on your record, how do you get it off?” After the election, a group of Floridians who had been prevented from voting sued Harris and other state officials. David Klausner, a computer-forensics expert who worked with the plaintiffs, told me that D.B.T. had used almost inconceivably sloppy methods, flagging voters with different Social Security numbers, and even genders, from the felons they were being matched with. The roster had been expanded by using names of felons from ten other states. “There were infants on the list,” he told me. “There were dead people.” Klausner calculated that about forty per cent of the people identified as potential felons were Black. “The project was explicitly racial—as Jim Crow as you can get,” he said. Officials from D.B.T., forced to reëxamine the list, admitted that at least twenty thousand voters had been improperly flagged—roughly forty times the number of votes separating Bush and Gore. Klausner believes that the actual number was much higher, but said that there was no way to determine an exact figure. “The state’s records were a mess, and they were hiding things from us—they were lying,” he told me. “I think they wanted to do it to insure a margin of victory for Bush.” The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded, “Florida’s overzealous efforts to purge voters from the rolls, conducted under the guise of an anti-fraud campaign, resulted in the inexcusable and patently unjust removal of disproportionate numbers of African American voters.” It’s unclear how many improperly flagged voters were prevented from casting ballots on Election Day. Edward Hailes, who was the commission’s general counsel at the time, told me that he believed there were thousands. “As far as I’m concerned, that purge swung the Presidential election,” he said. After the chaos of the 2000 election, Florida’s legislators enacted reforms to make voting and counting more efficient. Among the most popular was an expansion of early voting, which enabled people to cast ballots at specified locations before the election. Early voting was especially widespread in Black communities, where people often found that the extra days made it easier to vote without having to take time off from work. In the state’s most populous counties, early voting included the two Sundays before Election Day. Around the state, pastors in predominantly Black churches urged their congregants to cast ballots after services were over. In 2008, when Barack Obama carried Florida and won the Presidency, the largest share of Black votes in the state came from those who voted early. The practice, known as Souls to the Polls, has spread across the country. “Souls to the Polls was an innovative way to tap into the strength of the Black church,” the Reverend R. B. Holmes, Jr., of the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Tallahassee, told me. The results of the 2008 election startled Republican leaders. Obama’s coalition, which included African-Americans, the college-educated, and the young, seemed built for the future. The G.O.P.’s older, whiter voters belonged to demographic sectors that seemed certain to shrink. Republicans across the country began an extended push to reduce voter turnout. “The Republicans realize that voting rules can be changed in a way to achieve a partisan end,” Marc Elias, a voting-rights lawyer for the Democratic Party, said. “Florida becomes a host of that virus—and an exporter.” In 2010, Florida voters elected Rick Scott, a hard-edged conservative, as governor. Scott was the former chief executive of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, which he had helped to build into the country’s largest for-profit hospital chain. On his watch, though, the F.B.I. found that HCA was defrauding Medicare by, among other things, systematically overcharging the government and paying huge kickbacks to physicians. Federal prosecutors chose not to indict Scott, but, after the F.B.I. raided the company’s offices, HCA pleaded guilty to at least fourteen felonies and was fined $1.7 billion, which was then the largest settlement for health-care fraud in American history. Scott resigned, having accumulated a net worth of more than two hundred million dollars, and financed his run for governor largely with his personal fortune. When Scott took office, he and the Republican-controlled legislature embarked on a series of initiatives that curtailed access to the polls. In previous elections, state rules had allowed fourteen days of early voting; the legislature eliminated six of those days, including the Sunday before elections, and restricted the hours of early-voting sites. It also sharply tightened the use of third-party groups, such as the League of Women Voters, to register voters, and imposed criminal penalties for such lapses as registering voters without a permit. Under one of the more exacting requirements, volunteers who registered people to vote were given exactly forty-eight hours to submit each form to the state. Those who missed the deadline were fined. The next year, a federal judge, Robert Hinkle, scaled back the restrictions on voter registration, wryly dismissing the idea that they had been intended to prevent the system from being abused. “If the goal is to discourage voter-registration drives and thus also to make it harder for new voters to register, this may work,” he wrote. But Republican legislators portrayed the strictures as a victory for civic spirit. During one floor debate, the state senator Mike Bennett said, “Do you ever read the stories about the people in Africa—the people in the desert, who literally walk two and three hundred miles so they can have an opportunity to do what we do? And we want to make it more convenient? . . . Do we want to go to their house? Take the polling booth with us?” He went on, “I want them to fight for it. I want them to know what it’s like. I want them to go down there and have to walk across town to go over and vote.” Bennett later became the supervisor of elections in Manatee County. In the weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, he closed dozens of polling sites, forcing more than half the county’s Black population to find a new place to vote. Before Amendment Four passed, the Florida constitution provided only one avenue to felons who wanted their voting rights restored: clemency from the state. Jeb Bush granted clemency to seventy-six thousand felons during his eight years as governor; Charlie Crist approved a hundred and fifty-five thousand requests in four years. Scott, in eight years, gave clemency to barely three thousand felons. Clemency hearings are held four times a year in the capitol, in an auditorium where the Florida cabinet meets. The governor and his officials sit on an elevated platform. The felons appear one at a time, and have five minutes apiece to make their case. The law does not require the governor to give a reason for denying clemency, and Scott was unabashed about not having any. “Let me first explain how the process works,” he told one group of felons. “There are absolutely no standards. So we can make any decisions we want. . . . There’s really no law that says you deserve anything.” In June, 2011, Scott heard the case of Leon Gillis III, a former drug addict who had served several years in prison for drug and robbery convictions. Since then, Gillis had founded a rehabilitation program and worked as a counsellor to seven hundred recovering heroin addicts in the Daytona Beach area. Gillis, who was sixty-two, told Scott that he took full responsibility for his crimes and asked that his voting rights be restored. Scott told him that he’d have to keep waiting. “How long is that?” Gillis asked. “I’m not sure,” Scott said. “I think every case is different.” Gillis persisted: “What else am I supposed to do? If I am doing everything I am supposed to do, and I am making sure I do the right thing I’m supposed to do, then how long am I supposed to wait?” “I couldn’t tell you that answer,” Scott said. “I don’t feel comfortable doing it.” In the summer of 2012, with a Presidential election approaching, Scott initiated Project Integrity, a statewide program that he said was meant to safeguard the electoral system against noncitizen voters. “You don’t get to vote in Florida if you’re a non-U.S. citizen,” he said. An initial sweep flagged a hundred and eighty-two thousand people, but the methodology was so shoddy—officials compared voter registrations with driver’s licenses—that it apparently ensnared thousands of legal voters. Among those who received letters informing them that they weren’t citizens was Bill Internicola, a ninety-one-year-old who had won a Bronze Star at the Battle of the Bulge. Officials later whittled the list of suspected noncitizens down to twenty-six hundred, but an analysis by the Miami Herald found that it was still dominated by likely Democratic voters. A federal appellate court nullified Project Integrity, ruling that it violated laws against political purges. In the Presidential election that year, Scott and other Republican lawmakers found that the restrictions on early voting had backfired. Polling places were overwhelmed by heavy turnout, forcing many voters to wait in line for hours and causing several well-publicized cases of fainting. Facing an outcry, legislators repealed some restrictions, including the ban on voting the Sunday before elections, which they made optional by county. But each failing strategy seemed only to inspire Republican leaders to look for another. In 2014, officials in Scott’s administration banned early voting on college campuses. Florida’s public colleges and universities had eight hundred and thirty thousand students, and nearly a third of them had voted early in the previous election; like many young voters, they tended to support Democratic candidates. Scott’s officials expressed concern that a lack of parking spaces would disrupt campus life. A federal judge, Mark Walker, rejected that argument, writing that the ban was “unexplainable on grounds other than age.” Nevertheless, the legislature voted again in 2019 to require that early-voting sites have “sufficient non-permitted parking.” Since most college campuses allow parking only by permit, advocates said that the state was obviously trying again to quash early voting. Early this year, under the threat of another lawsuit, the state agreed to allow early-voting sites on campus. “We think it’s finally in place now,” Patricia Brigham, the president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, told me. Even the weather became the basis for a fight over ballot access. When hurricanes struck before the elections in 2016 and 2018, Scott refused to extend registration deadlines. In the first storm, a federal judge forced him to keep registration open; in the second, another judge allowed him to close it in unaffected areas. Legislators who sought to tighten ballot access often spoke of preventing fraud, even if they rarely produced evidence of it. But occasionally they described their efforts forthrightly as a matter of partisanship. In 2012, James Greer, a former chairman of the state Republican Party, told a Florida newspaper, “The Republican Party, the strategists, the consultants—they firmly believe that early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates. It’s done for one reason and one reason only . . . because early voting is not good for us.” Greer added that his fellow-Republicans hadn’t discussed voter fraud. “They never came in to see me and tell me we had a fraud issue,” he said. “It’s all a marketing ploy.” (Greer later pleaded guilty to funnelling two hundred thousand dollars from the Party into a shell company called Victory Strategies.) Republican legislators were aided by the landmark Supreme Court decision in Shelby v. Holder, in 2013, which invalidated the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that had made it harder to enact discriminatory voting laws. “The Shelby decision opened the floodgates,” Myrna Pérez, who runs a voting-rights program at New York University’s Brennan Center, said. North Carolina’s legislature quickly passed a voter-I.D. law that disallowed several forms of identification disproportionately used by Black people, including those for students, government employees, and people receiving public assistance. An appeals court struck down the law, calling it an effort to “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” Soon afterward, Texas imposed a similarly stringent voter-I.D. law. In Florida, Democratic legislators sometimes objected to the Republican efforts, but they were perpetually in the minority. Some found that they couldn’t even discuss the matter with their peers across the aisle. “I can have a reasonable conversation with any Republican elected official about any issue—except voting,” Dan Gelber, a former House minority leader who is now the mayor of Miami Beach, told me. “When you bring up voting, the Darth Vader mask comes up right away. You can tell—their consultants have said to them, ‘This is how you win.’ ” For years, lawyers close to the G.O.P. have battered the state with lawsuits seeking to restrict voting. In 2016, a conservative group called the American Civil Rights Union sued Broward County, the state’s most Democratic area, charging that election officials had failed to purge felons and other ineligible voters from their rolls. The suit was handled by J. Christian Adams, a leading conservative activist. Adams didn’t claim to have discovered any instances of fraud. Instead, he invoked a novel legal theory: because the number of registered voters in Broward County exceeded the voting-age population, the county must be maintaining illegal voters on its rolls. A federal court threw out the suit; excess enrollment is typically the result of voters who have moved or died. But, earlier this year, another high-profile conservative voting-rights lawyer, William Consovoy, made a nearly identical argument to the Florida secretary of state, threatening to sue unless the state embarked on a vigorous purge. Consovoy wrote, “Florida’s failure to provide accurate voter rolls violates federal law, jeopardizes the integrity of the upcoming 2020 federal election, and signals to voters that elections in Florida are not being properly safeguarded.” Consovoy is also part of a team that is trying to prevent New York prosecutors from examining Trump’s tax records. He and the President seem aligned in their views on electoral fraud. After Trump failed to win the popular vote in 2016, he claimed, without citing any evidence, that millions of people had voted illegally. In office, he formed a commission to investigate voter fraud. The commission was disbanded after eight months, having found no evidence of widespread cheating. In November, 2018, Scott ran for the U.S. Senate, and he and the incumbent, Bill Nelson, were caught in a virtual tie. When the ballots were counted, Scott led by about twelve thousand votes, out of eight million cast. Under state law, that triggered an automatic recount. Decorum quickly collapsed. Standing outside the governor’s mansion, Scott vowed, “I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.” Then he flew to Washington, D.C., to preëmptively join in a photo op for new senators. Under Florida law, a recount may take no longer than five days; after that time, only a court order can reopen the process. That year, three statewide races were close enough to trigger recounts, and election officials worked around the clock. In Palm Beach County, vote-counting machines overheated and malfunctioned. In local election offices, lawyers for each side disputed the validity of ballots. In Bay County, which had been ravaged by Hurricane Michael, the supervisor of elections took votes, illegally, by e-mail and by fax. Nelson’s team filed federal lawsuits disputing counting rules, hoping to capture rejected ballots. “It was a gut-wrenching, soul-crushing experience,” Marley Wilkes, his campaign manager, told me. As the recount proceeded, Scott raised the possibility that he would not accept the outcome if he lost. Before all the votes were tallied, he sued two of the state’s largest counties, which were mostly Democratic. “Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,” Scott said, offering no proof. Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from the panhandle, flew to Fort Lauderdale to hold press conferences outside the office of the supervisor of elections, in which he accused Democrats of an elaborate scheme. “If the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don’t work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren’t, then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,” he said. Earlier in the campaign, Nelson had warned about the possibility of Russian intelligence officers breaking into Florida’s election systems. “They have already penetrated certain counties in the state, and they now have free rein to move about,” he said. Nelson had been briefed on the subject by the chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the briefing was classified, and he was constrained in what he could reveal. Scott ridiculed him, calling him “confused.” In case voters didn’t get the hint about Nelson’s age—he was seventy-five—Scott’s campaign manager called him “rambling, incoherent, confused, disjointed.” A few months later, the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller revealed that the Russians had indeed hacked the election systems of at least one Florida county in 2016; a subsequent Senate report indicated that at least one more had been hacked and two more targeted. As in 2000, any problem that affected even a handful of votes was potentially decisive—and several problems emerged that were large enough to swing the race. One of them was late mail-in ballots. In Florida, as in most states, ballots must arrive before the polls close, no matter when they were mailed. In 2018, according to an analysis by the Dartmouth professor Michael Herron, about two hundred thousand ballots arrived on Election Day or the day before, and more kept coming after the deadline passed. “There were thousands of ballots arriving every day, for days after the election,” John Devaney, a voting-rights lawyer who represents progressive organizations, told me. Nelson sued to compel the state to count any ballot postmarked before the election, as his lawyers offered statistical analyses showing that early deadlines were significantly more likely to exclude poor voters and minority voters. They failed, and some fifteen thousand absentee ballots went uncounted. Florida law allows campaigns to appoint observers to monitor voting and counting, with the power to challenge voters or ballots that are thought to be invalid. Each absentee ballot must be opened by hand, and the signature on the ballot must match the voter’s signature on file with the election authority. If an observer succeeds in challenging the signature, the ballot is rejected. In the 2018 race, according to Herron, about eleven thousand ballots were rejected because their signatures did not match, or because they were not signed. (Some ballots didn’t arrive at all: after the election, a box containing two hundred and sixty-six ballots was found in a U.S. Postal Service distribution center that had been evacuated the previous month, after processing packages sent by Cesar Sayoc, a right-wing terrorist who mailed bombs to thirteen prominent Trump opponents.) For Nelson, the harshest disappointment involved “undervotes.” In the Democratic stronghold of Broward County, thirty thousand voters did not vote for either Senate candidate. It turned out that, because of a faulty design, the Senate race had been buried at the bottom of the ballot’s first column, after a long list of voting instructions. Voters skipping over the instructions had evidently failed to see it. “That was the whole race right there,” Nelson told me. “Those were my votes.” After recounts by machine and by hand, Scott won by ten thousand and thirty-three votes—one-tenth of one per cent of the eight million cast. Nelson and his aides suggest that the long Republican campaign to restrict voter turnout had finally come to fruition. They look forward to a time when the state’s population has changed too much for such tactics to make a difference. “There is a systematic effort to suppress what Republicans believe are going to be Democratic votes,” Nelson told me. “It’s driven by demographics—but it’s only a matter of time before demographics catch up with them.” In December, 2017, Ron DeSantis, a little-known congressman from Florida’s east coast, appeared on Fox News, to talk with Laura Ingraham about the investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia. On the show, DeSantis espoused an extreme—and unsupported—view of the inquiry, saying that it had been cooked up by F.B.I. agents to keep Trump from getting elected. “This is actually taking a bias and basically saying you’re going to use the machinery of government to prevent the American people from making a choice,” he said. “That’s very disturbing.” It was the third time that month that he had appeared on Fox to portray the President as a victim. At the time, DeSantis was running in the Republican primary for governor, and he trailed Adam Putnam, the state’s genial agriculture commissioner, by a wide margin. Trump saw DeSantis on Fox, and nine days later endorsed him, calling him a “brilliant young leader” who “loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!” DeSantis campaigned as Trump’s surrogate, telling supporters that he had taught his young children to say, “Build the wall.” Trump sometimes appeared at his side, and his backing helped DeSantis surge past Putnam and win the general election. DeSantis was forty years old, with an eclectic background: he captained the baseball team at Yale, graduated from Harvard Law School, and served as a legal adviser to a Navy seal commander in Falluja, Iraq. In Congress, he reinvented himself as a populist. (As a Florida lobbyist told me, “You won’t hear him talk much about Harvard and Yale.”) DeSantis helped found the Freedom Caucus, and signed a pledge, promoted by the Koch brothers, to vote against any legislation to slow global warming which required new taxes. In the months after DeSantis was elected governor, he demonstrated fealty to Trump, appearing in the Oval Office and receiving him in Florida. Trump rewarded him with generous federal aid, for hurricane relief and Everglades restoration. Rodney Barreto, a Miami businessman who speaks to DeSantis regularly, told me, “Ron has made it clear that he’s the guy who can call up the President and get what we need.” When the coronavirus struck, DeSantis disregarded the counsel of epidemiologists. He issued an order for people to stay at home for a month but declined to mandate masks and rarely wore one himself. He was slow to close beaches and parks, even as spring-break revellers gathered in Fort Lauderdale and in Miami. He ordered nonessential businesses to close but defined the term so broadly that it lost its meaning; among the enterprises deemed too important to shut down was professional wrestling. Florida began reopening on May 4th, and, as the rate of infection initially stayed low, DeSantis was celebrated among conservatives. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, wrote an op-ed titled “Where Does Ron DeSantis Go to Get His Apology?” Lowry proclaimed that DeSantis, by ignoring the experts and the media, had allowed Florida to reopen at a relatively low cost. DeSantis told Lowry that he regularly reviewed virus data and, with his team, charted a course that differed substantially from that of New York and other coastal cities, cordoning off retirement homes and allowing local officials to decide their own containment plans. He rejected criticism that he was flying without instruments: “I view it more as a badge of honor.” Lowry affirmed that DeSantis had outsmarted the experts, writing, “The disaster so widely predicted hasn’t materialized.” Within weeks, DeSantis’s strategy collapsed. Hospitals were flooded with patients; many began bringing in nurses from other states, for wages as high as thirty thousand dollars a month. The state’s vast population of retirees, the backbone of Republican dominance, was suddenly threatened. Mayors began to close their cities. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, told me that DeSantis’s strategy suffered from a misplaced faith that the state could protect its most vulnerable. “People drive, they go to the grocery store, their families come and visit them,” she said. What’s more, the elderly were not the only group at risk; there were the obese, people with diabetes and heart conditions. “The at-risk population is half the country,” she said. The plan’s other flaw was its lack of an aggressive contact-tracing campaign. “That’s not really happening in Florida,” Nuzzo said. Facing catastrophe, DeSantis declared in late June, “We’re not going back.” Schools would reopen and Disney World would welcome visitors. At a press conference in Tampa, he and Vice-President Mike Pence emphasized that there was no trade-off between fighting the virus and reopening the economy. DeSantis attributed the spectacular rise in infections to increased testing, and assured Florida residents that the situation was under control. “If everyone is, you know, enjoying life but doing it responsibly,” he said, “we’re going to be fine.” Soon afterward, the editorial board of the South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote, “Your daily upbeat message is hopelessly at odds with what Floridians are going through.” The headline was “Help Us Out, Gov. DeSantis. We’re Dying Here.” By mid-July, the state was recording nearly twelve thousand new cases a day. From the beginning, questions were raised about how truthful DeSantis’s administration had been regarding the epidemic. In May, Rebekah Jones, who managed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, was fired for refusing, in her words, “to manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” (A DeSantis spokesperson has said that Jones was fired for a pattern of insubordination.) When death counts compiled by county medical examiners began to regularly exceed those released by the Florida Department of Health, the state withheld the higher number. After weeks of assurances that a vigorous contact-tracing campaign was reaching more than ninety per cent of infected people, workers in Miami-Dade County discovered that the rate was closer to seventeen per cent. “You can’t spin the pandemic away,” Gelber, the Miami Beach mayor, told me. The chaos made folk heroes of people, like Jones, who insisted on getting reliable information to the public. Another was Mike Chitwood, the sheriff of Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. In March, Chitwood began posting the latest local virus statistics, including places where there had been large outbreaks, on social media. Every night, Chitwood got data from the Department of Health and updated the tally. The posts became hugely popular with residents; some fifty thousand people regularly viewed them, he said. But Chitwood became increasingly skeptical of the information he was getting. “We knew from people inside the state government that they were not accurately reporting the statistics,” he told me. In early July, he posted a disclaimer, saying that he could not guarantee the veracity of the information. The next day, officials informed Chitwood that the data would no longer be available. “I went ballistic—absolutely batshit,” he said. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Why are we giving out less information?” He posted an apology and discontinued the updates. An outcry ensued, and the officials backed down. Chitwood is a DeSantis supporter, but he concluded that the Governor had been less than forthright. He recalled a lesson he had learned years before, as a police officer in Philadelphia. “When there’s trouble getting the information, it’s because the information is troubling,” he said. The pandemic upended calculations of political self-interest. For much of the past two years, DeSantis has been expected to deliver Florida to Trump in November. But, with the virus dominating the public conversation, it seemed increasingly uncertain whether he could—or even wanted to. By late summer, most polls showed Trump trailing Biden in the state. As DeSantis’s approval rating plummeted, too, he tried to distance himself from the President. A lawyer who speaks regularly with both men told me that DeSantis had decided to provide as little help as possible. He stopped appearing with Trump, stopped visiting the Oval Office, and dragged his feet on raising money for him. DeSantis even tried to undermine efforts to stage the Republican Convention in Jacksonville, which Trump ultimately cancelled. “Ron will tell you he’s doing everything he can for the President, and he’ll sound believable,” the lawyer told me. “But there’s zero evidence for that, and the President notices.” Alan Rubin, a lobbyist who works in both Washington and Florida, told me that DeSantis was increasingly worried that Trump could lose Florida, and was positioning himself to be able to work with a Biden Administration. People around DeSantis believe that he intends to run for President in 2024 and isn’t convinced that having Trump in the White House improves his chances. “He’s a very smart operator,” Rubin said. “Ron’s going to do what he needs to do.” In April, election supervisors from every county in Florida wrote to DeSantis, urging him to help minimize the effects of the coronavirus on voting in November. The supervisors said that the statewide primary, in March, had presented “significant challenges,” including “substantial numbers” of poll workers who had dropped out at the last minute. They told DeSantis flatly that they were not capable of conducting an election entirely through the mail, and were concerned that they lacked the resources necessary to conduct even limited in-person voting. The supervisors asked DeSantis to adopt several measures: increase the number of places where early ballots could be cast; give supervisors more time to send voters mail-in ballots and more time to count early ballots; and allow early-voting sites to be reused as polling places on Election Day, to eliminate the need to erect new ones. “As counties are preparing and making staffing and logistical decisions now, the flexibility and authority provided as soon as possible would be of great benefit,” the supervisors said. DeSantis waited two months to respond, and then granted one of the requests: election workers could begin counting mail-in ballots as early as forty days before the election, instead of twenty-two. He offered to make state employees available to work at polling places, and to “coördinate” with supervisors to supply hand sanitizer and protective gear. On the other requests, one election supervisor told me, “the governor basically ignored us.” As DeSantis stalled on preparations, Trump was pursuing a campaign against voting by mail. “The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-in Voting is allowed to take place, & everyone knows it,” he tweeted. During the summer, his Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, removed high-speed sorting machines and instituted other changes that radically diminished the capacity of the Postal Service. Testifying before Congress, DeJoy promised that the mail would be delivered “fully and on time” on Election Day. But in Florida’s elections in 2016 and 2018, even with mail delivery operating normally, thousands of ballots didn’t make it on time. In Florida, and across the United States, the coronavirus pandemic is inspiring fears that voting in person could be dangerous. What happens if a voter shows up without a mask, angering those who are wearing them? Under Florida law, election supervisors have a responsibility to maintain order at polling places, but they cannot make arrests or prevent anyone from lawfully voting. “The bouncer at the precinct is typically a seventy-five-year-old lady sitting at a card table,” Jon Mills, a former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, said. Since the spring, when the epidemic took hold, a team of lawyers led by Marc Elias, the Democratic voting-rights lawyer, has been presiding over lawsuits in eighteen states, spurring changes to make it easier to vote and in some cases overturning Republican-backed laws that have been in place for years. Elias has sought what he calls the “four pillars” of voting by mail: all mail-in ballots will have prepaid postage; any ballot postmarked by Election Day will be counted; voters whose signatures don’t match will be given a chance to explain themselves; and community groups will be allowed to deliver ballots for others. Elias’s team has won complete victories in three states and partial victories in four; the other cases are ongoing. “I have won in more states than I thought I would,” he said. One case involved the Wisconsin primary, in April, when tens of thousands of ballots were postmarked on or before Election Day but arrived late. Elias sued election officials, and the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the votes. In Elias’s suit in Florida, the state agreed to a settlement: it would launch a voter-education campaign and allow the maximum number of days for early voting. But on the central issue—counting all mail-in ballots that are postmarked before Election Day—Elias and his plaintiffs lost. Trump soon posted a bizarre tweet, urging Florida Republicans to vote by mail, a position that contradicted his earlier tirades. Mindy Finn, the C.E.O. of an analytics firm called Citizen Data, said her organization projected that far more Democrats than Republicans would vote by mail in Florida. “By polarizing vote by mail, Trump appears to have been depressing his own turnout,” she said. Finn’s firm is predicting 4.2 million absentee ballots in Florida, and some observers worry that—given the unprecedented volume, the need to open each ballot by hand, and the shortage of workers—it will be nearly impossible to get them all processed before the deadline, on the Saturday after the election. Eddie Perez, of the Open Source Election Technology Institute, which focusses on elections and voting, told me, “My fear is that people will be drowning on Election Day.” Intelligence analysts have assured Trump that there is no evidence that foreign adversaries will try to falsify mail-in ballots. But the spectre of interference lingers. According to the Mueller report, Russian agents made Florida a focus in 2016. Before the election, they sent spear-phishing e-mails to a hundred and twenty officials, attempting to hack into local election systems. A Senate intelligence report found that in at least two counties they gained entry to voter-registration rolls. The Russians also successfully hacked a Florida-based company that makes software for voter registration and check-in. Experts say that registration systems are especially vulnerable, because they are linked to the Internet. “If the Russians had pulled the trigger, there would have been utter chaos on Election Day,” Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told me. According to a former senior Obama Administration official, there was concern that Russian agents were also apparently experimenting with their capability to alter vote tallies. “That’s just what they do in elections in Russia,” another former senior official said. American intelligence officials say they have no evidence that the Russians changed any totals. It’s more likely, according to several former Obama Administration officials, that they were probing vulnerabilities in election systems across the country. “This was a sort of dry run,” one said. But it’s not clear that officials looked very hard for evidence of vote tampering. After the 2016 election, only a handful of states conducted audits that would determine if electronic voting machines had been penetrated; the federal government did none. After an inquiry from Senator Ron Wyden, of Oregon, the Department of Homeland Security responded that it had no “mandate” to examine state voting machines. Wyden was indignant: “On what basis can the Administration make its claims regarding a lack of evidence of foreign interference if it hasn’t looked for it?” A foreign adversary who wanted to sow dissension wouldn’t necessarily need to change the election results—which, given the decentralized nature of voting in the United States, would be difficult to do. “I don’t think changing the counts is what they are aiming for,” Laura Rosenberger, a foreign-policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, told me, of the Russians. “They want to cause doubt and confusion, so that you have a situation where everyone is fighting and no one accepts the legitimacy of the election.” At the Reverend Holmes’s church, in Tallahassee, the congregants are anticipating November with a mixture of fear and hope. On a recent Sunday, Holmes said from the pulpit that the election would be a defining moment in American history, and that his parishioners should let nothing—not voter suppression, not the coronavirus—stand in the way of their casting ballots. Drawing on the Book of Daniel, Holmes told the story of three Hebrew boys who refused to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar, even at the threat of being burned alive, because he was not the true and only God. “Nebuchadnezzar was so full of himself that he wanted his own statue—on Mt. Rushmore,” he said, eliciting knowing laughs from the pews. “But the three boys would not bow down to this paranoid, insecure king.” Quoting John Lewis, the late congressman and civil-rights leader, Holmes told the congregants that the boys who defied Nebuchadnezzar were getting into “good trouble”—the kind that people make when they refuse to yield to a tyrant. “Never be afraid to make noise,” he said, “to get into good trouble—necessary trouble.” Holmes’s right-wing counterparts have been spreading a more combative message. In north Florida, which Trump dominated in the 2016 elections, white evangelists fill the airwaves with apocalyptic prophecies. One such commentator is the Reverend Gene A. Youngblood, the pastor of the First Conservative Baptist Church in Jacksonville, who hosts a radio show called “Let’s Face the Issues.” In a recent broadcast, Youngblood warned of a country besieged by the forces of Marxism, state control, and anarchy. The summer’s protests against police brutality, he said, had brought a flood of chaos and crime. “We’ve seen blocks and blocks and blocks of our major cities burned and destroyed by vandals and thugs of Black Lives Matter,” he said. “Ladies and gentlemen, it is like a cancer—it is spreading across the whole body that we call the United States of America.” Youngblood’s darkest vision was of the coronavirus, which the “socialist-Marxist-B.L.M.-communist Democratic Party” had used to “bring in fear and anxiety in America as never before.” The purpose, he maintained, was to impose forced vaccinations, which Bill Gates and the government would use to implant a chip that allowed them to control citizens. Youngblood said that it was imperative for Christians to vote in November. If they failed to turn out, he said, “we will lose the battle, and we will have a socialist, communist, dictatorship form of government in America.” To prepare for the elections, each side is assembling an army of volunteers and lawyers to observe voting and counting. Juan Peñalosa, the executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, told me that he was deploying at least three thousand lawyers, trained in election law, to weigh in on ballot disputes in the state’s nearly six thousand precincts. The Trump campaign says that it is marshalling fifty thousand poll watchers to work in fifteen key states, presumably including Florida. This November marks the first Presidential election since 1980 in which the Republican National Committee will not be bound by a court decree that has tightly limited its activities around voting sites. The decree arose from a Democratic lawsuit charging that, in a New Jersey governor’s race, off-duty police officers, some carrying guns and wearing armbands that read “National Ballot Security Task Force,” had intimidated Black voters. “We fully expect Trump volunteers to be at every polling place in the state on Election Day,” Peñalosa said. The Reverend Holmes seemed unswayed. For years, he has urged his congregation to take part in the early voting of Souls to the Polls. After his sermon, he led about a hundred members on a walk to the county courthouse, where many of them cast early ballots for the statewide primary on August 18th. Holmes’s march was given a police escort, and many candidates came along to solicit parishioners’ support. One member of the congregation, an eighty-year-old named William Brown, grew up in Mulberry, a phosphate-mining town in central Florida. The white neighborhoods, he recalled, were demarcated by hedgerows and railroad tracks, which no sane Black person would go past. For years, the center of Mulberry was marked by a hulking tree where many Black men were lynched. In the nineteen-fifties and sixties, Brown told me, voting was impossible for a Black person in Mulberry. “There was never any issue,” he said. “I didn’t even think about it.” Brown joined the Army and saw the world, and while he was away America changed a little. In 1984, at the age of forty-four, he went to the polls for the first time—to vote, he said, for “whichever Democrat was running against Reagan.” His candidate, Walter Mondale, lost badly. But he hasn’t missed an election since, and he looks forward to voting in November. “Oh, Lord,” he said. “I’m not done yet.”♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Union at the Center of the Medicare for All Fight in Nevada,7712,"Subscribers to The New Yorker’s new 2020 election newsletter, On the Trail, received this piece in their in-boxes. Sign up to receive future installments. “Labor got its foothold in Las Vegas with Al Bramlet, a flamboyant union worker who arrived in Las Vegas in 1946 and made a deal with the Mafia,” Sara Mosle wrote in The New Yorker, in 1996. “Bramlet promised to recruit workers to the remote desert town in return for union recognition and a few perks for himself.” Howard Hughes eventually pushed the Mafia out. Bramlet wound up murdered. But the union he led, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, remained. This year, for the first time ever, Nevadans can vote early in the state’s caucuses, and the Culinary Union’s headquarters, a cluster of low-slung buildings north of the Strip, was designated an early-voting site. When I stopped by, on Tuesday morning, the room for voters was still being set up. “Just so you know,” I overheard one union member tell another, “there’s a lot of chatter that we’re the best thing to ever happen.” The Culinary—representing guest-room attendants, food-and-drink servers, porters, bellhops, and laundry and kitchen workers—is as locally significant as any union in the country. In the nineties, when Mosle wrote her story, the Culinary was transitioning from an era in which it was led by men who held “front of the house” jobs to one in which it was led by women who held “back of the house” jobs. The population of Clark County, Nevada, which contains Las Vegas, is now more than thirty per cent Hispanic. In 2012, Geoconda Argüello-Kline, a Nicaraguan immigrant, was elected the first Latina leader of the Culinary. The organization has fought for job security, wages, and other benefits for its sixty thousand members. It also runs a heralded health-care system—members pay no deductibles or premiums and only some modest co-pays, and they have access to a health-care center maintained by the union. The Culinary has no desire to trade in its health-care plan, a fact that has placed it in the middle of the most intense policy dispute of the 2020 Democratic Presidential primary. As the race turned toward Nevada this month, the union began distributing a scorecard of the candidates, which said that Bernie Sanders—the champion of Medicare for All, which would replace all private health-care plans—would “end” the union’s health care. Soon after, the union put out a statement saying that Sanders’s supporters had “viciously attacked the Culinary Union and working families in Nevada simply because our union has provided facts on what certain healthcare proposals might do to take away the system of care we have built.” Last week, the Nevada Independent reported that two of the union’s top officials had received personal threats: “Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline, for instance, has come under attack for her Nicaraguan heritage, and union spokeswoman Bethany Khan was accused of being paid off by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other Democratic establishment types.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   Sanders, for his part, walked a more conciliatory line than he often does in the face of criticism. Last week, he tweeted his support of the union “fighting for health care, a pension and fair wages.” On Tuesday, during a CNN town hall, he said, “I will condemn, absolutely, anybody, including my campaign or any other campaign, that makes vicious personal attacks against people.” There was speculation about whom the union might endorse, and whether one of Sanders’s more moderate opponents would benefit from this dispute. In the end, the union chose not to endorse anybody. At the headquarters, I met Carmela Perez, a union member who works at the MGM Grand. Born in Mexico, Perez emigrated in the late nineteen-nineties and struggled for several years to provide for her family, working low-paying, nonunion jobs. Then somebody told her about the Culinary and how it had a facility to train people for casino jobs. She got a job, as a dishwasher, that paid twelve dollars and seventy-five cents an hour, before moving to a pantry job—which the union also trained her for—that raised her wages to nineteen dollars an hour. At first, she said, she had a hard time believing the extent of the health benefits that she was offered. “I was, like, How is this possible?” she told me. “There are people out there who wouldn’t give you a stick of gum.” She’s against Medicare for All, she said. “Look, I think it’s a good idea to give health care to everyone, but don’t touch ours,” she said. “What’s going to happen tomorrow? What are the Republicans trying to do with Obamacare? Repeal it, right? What’s going to happen if other Presidents don’t think the same as Sanders? So, what’s more valuable: a bird in the hand or a hundred in the air?” Follow the latest results from Nevada’s Presidential caucus. It was time for early voting to start. People were lined up in the parking lot, and the union’s leadership held a little rally around a podium. The congressman Steven Horsford, who once ran the Culinary Training Academy, and who has endorsed Joe Biden, gave some remarks. Afterward, I asked him how the union’s concerns could be better incorporated into conversations about health care in Washington. “We need to elect more of our own members, like me, who come out of the union and know what these issues actually mean,” he said. A few minutes later, Perez reappeared in the parking lot. The Nevada caucus process allows early voters to choose three to five candidates for President, in order of their preference. Perez picked Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer. Polls show that among Latino voters, both nationally and in Nevada, Sanders leads the 2020 field, a fact that his campaign has actively touted. The political arm of the immigrant-rights group Make the Road has endorsed him. On Tuesday night, I attended a phone-banking session that the group held in a rented storefront, a few miles north of the strip. Angelica Romero, a guest-room attendant who has lived in Las Vegas for twenty-seven years, after emigrating from Guadalajara, Mexico, is a member of the Culinary Union. These past few weeks, she’s been volunteering with Make the Road’s political arm, knocking on doors, talking to voters. “I support my union; I’m with them a hundred per cent,” she told me. “But we have different opinions.” She supports Medicare for All, she said, because “it’s about fairness.” Her daughter doesn’t have health insurance, for instance, and “we all deserve it.” “For me, democracy is about everyone participating and having a vote,” she said. “Obviously, I’d like everyone to be on my side. But that’s the great thing about this country.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

What Would a Proper Coronavirus Stimulus Plan Look Like?,9916,"After a record fall on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly two thousand points on Friday, as Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the coronavirus and negotiators from his Administration tried to reach an agreement with House Democrats on an emergency spending bill that could possibly include guaranteeing paid sick leave and extending unemployment benefits. Given the rapidly expanding impact of the virus, economists of all political persuasions agree that a more substantial stimulus is needed. But what should it look like? Lots of different proposals are flying around, but the Trump Administration wants to make a cut in payroll tax the centerpiece of any plan. But temporarily eliminating payroll tax won’t help people who aren’t working, and, if the tax holiday is extended to the contributions that employers make, as the White House reportedly wants, it would be a huge and indiscriminate giveaway to corporate America. The other problem with the Trump Administration’s thinking about the stimulus is that it doesn’t directly address the immense task of dealing with the virus itself, which continues to spread through the population. As the number of cases rises, medical systems could easily become overwhelmed. With schools closed, many parents will have to stay at home to look after their children. The travel and leisure industries are already facing a shocking slump in demand. (On Tuesday, the president of United Airlines said that total domestic flight bookings had fallen by seventy per cent.) Other industries could soon face similar problems, especially if big population centers are locked down. In China, in mid-February, the purchase of cars fell by ninety per cent. A significant downturn to the economy is inevitable—and, in some ways, desirable. If lower spending reflects the fact that the government, at the federal and state levels, is finally taking serious measures to slow the spread of the virus, that is a positive development for the economy over the medium and long term. The challenge is to get the country through the short-term hit—the next few months—without a wholesale economic and financial crisis. In this spirit, here is a three-part stimulus proposal, which is largely based on ideas that various economists, public-health experts, and foreign countries have already put forward. At the beginnings of April, May, and June, the U.S. Treasury should mail checks, or issue electronic transfers, of a thousand dollars to everybody in the country. This might sound like a crazy idea, but it isn’t. Harvard’s Jason Furman, who was a chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama Administration, has proposed making a one-time payment of a thousand dollars to every taxpaying U.S. resident and five hundred dollars to each child. Last month, the government of Hong Kong, which was dealing with a sharp rise in the number of covid-19 cases, announced that it would issue ten-thousand Hong Kong dollars, which is about thirteen hundred U.S. dollars, to all of its permanent residents aged eighteen and older. Pointing to “unprecedented times,” Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, said that the payments “will provide effective and targeted support to help the Hong Kong community withstand the current difficulties and gear up for a brighter tomorrow.” The same thing should be done in the United States on an even bigger scale. The size of the payments, and their staggered nature, would reflect the fact that the U.S.’s coronavirus crisis seems likely to extend for longer than it did in some Asian countries, which took early and Draconian actions in order to tackle it. Obviously, this proposal would be expensive, but not as expensive as Trump’s idea to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year, which would cost, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, about nine hundred and fifty billion dollars. Giving three thousand dollars to two hundred and ten million adult Americans would cost six hundred and thirty billion dollars. If people under eighteen were included, which perhaps they should be, to reflect the higher outgoings of families with children, the cost would be about nine hundred and ninety billion dollars. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures A second essential element of a proper stimulus is large-scale federal aid for states and municipalities that are dealing with the impact of the virus. There will probably be some of this in the initial spending bill, but far more needs to be done to insure that all Americans can access proper medical treatment if they need it. The quickest and most effective option is to use Medicaid, which already provides health-care coverage to about seventy-one million low-income adults and children, to cover more people. On Thursday, a group of public-health experts, including some who worked in the Obama Administration, laid out several ways in which this could be done. For the thirty-seven states that took advantage of the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid access, the federal government could increase the share of the costs—the “Medicaid match”—that it bears, the experts said, in a paper that they posted on their Web site. Another suggestion is to “add a state option to extend Medicaid eligibility for the duration of the covid-19 outbreak, to any state resident who is uninsured for all medically necessary services in connection with covid-related testing, treatment, and recovery, including treatment for complications and other health conditions arising from covid-19 or that could be worsened by covid-19.” Unfortunately, fourteen states, including two huge ones—Florida and Texas—have refused to expand Medicaid, despite the financial incentives contained in the A.C.A. The expert working group suggests further incentivizing these states to do so now. It also provides a list of other useful ideas, including immediately ordering an increase in the production of “personal protective equipment (e.g. masks), ventilator equipment, IV saline, and other medically critical supplies”; making sure that Medicaid covers all of the costs of testing and treatment related to covid-19; and setting up a 9/11-style fund for health-care workers who suffer medical and financial harm as a result of being exposed to the virus. “What we are facing is a once-in-a-century public health challenge, and the response from our government absolutely has to reflect that,” Howard Forman, a professor of public health at Yale, who coördinated the working group’s effort, said in a statement. A third economic essential is to prevent a domino-style collapse of the banking system, as businesses and individuals default on their loans wholesale. During the early nineteen-thirties, it was this sort of financial cataclysm that brought on the Great Depression. Preventing anything like this from happening again is primarily the job of the Federal Reserve, which has already taken some significant steps to stabilize the Treasury-bond market and the market for short-term interbank loans. But there will almost certainly need to be a fiscal component as well. In part, this may involve providing government guarantees for loans that airlines and other stricken businesses have already taken out, or else issuing them new ones. Many smaller firms may need help, too. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for low- or no-interest loans to be provided for “companies of all sizes that have been negatively affected by coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions, and that will use the money to avoid layoffs and hours reductions.” That sounds sensible, and other options could also be considered. On Thursday, the Australian government said that it would give small- and medium-sized enterprises up to twenty-five thousand Australian dollars, which is about fifteen thousand U.S. dollars, to help them cover their payrolls. How can the U.S. government pay for all of this? The obvious answer is to take advantage of record-low interest rates and issue Treasury bonds. Many governments borrow more during wartime, and the current moment is emerging as a challenge of that scale. Alternatively, the Fed could finance the emergency stimulus, either by purchasing the new Treasury bonds or creating fiat money and transferring it into people’s bank accounts. (The latter option would be a “helicopter drop” of the sort that Milton Friedman wrote about decades ago, which I discussed in an article for The New Yorker in 2015.) The larger point is that major actions need to be taken now, and there is no reason they can’t be taken. It will just take some political will and some political leadership, which so far has been sadly lacking. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

How 3-D Printers Are Helping to Fight the Coronavirus,10787,"Alittle more than a week ago, Isaac Budmen heard that a coronavirus testing site was going to be set up in Syracuse, New York, not far from where he lives with his partner, Stephanie Keefe. The couple, who are both artists, own a company that makes 3-D printers. They knew that medical workers had a shortage of face shields, one kind of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.), and they wondered if they could help. On a recent Saturday evening, after a few hours of research, Budmen and Keefe designed and printed a face-shield prototype. It wasn’t very good, Budmen told me. They modified the design, adding sizes for different face shapes, making sure there would not be a space between the shield and the wearer’s forehead, where microbes might be able to reach the eyes, nose, or mouth. With their printers running all night, they figured they could make a total of fifty shields. The office of the Onondaga County executive asked them to make three hundred. According to a survey released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Friday, about ninety-two per cent of the group’s members (two hundred and thirteen mayors, from forty-one states and Puerto Rico, representing forty-two million Americans) do not have enough testing kits or face masks for first responders and health-care workers; eighty-five per cent said that their hospitals do not have enough ventilators. The U.C.S.F. Health hospital system, in San Francisco, is running out of nasal swabs for testing, and a health-care system in Texas that serves a million people is in danger of shutting down testing sites because of a shortage of protective gear. In New York, where people are now waiting in long lines outside of emergency rooms and refrigerated trucks have been deployed as temporary morgues, Governor Andrew Cuomo asked the federal government to help the state get thirty thousand ventilators. But that help doesn’t appear to be coming anytime soon. In a recent interview on Fox News, Donald Trump said, “I don’t believe you need forty thousand or thirty thousand ventilators. You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order thirty thousand ventilators?’ ” Across the United States, an ad-hoc corps of health-care workers, designers, engineers, and fabricators like Budmen and Keefe have stepped into the breach. Dr. Paul Biddinger, the chair of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital, recently said, at a virtual town hall for the newly formed Massachusetts General Brigham Center for covid Innovation, that the situation requires “an Apollo 11 moonshot.” Dr. Gary Tearney, a pathologist and the co-director of the Center, said that the initiative was set up to marshal “the enormous outpouring of support” following the hospital’s recent public plea to anyone with 3-D printing and other prototyping capabilities, to make personal protective equipment for health-care workers. “We’re looking at designs and coördinating a way to print the most promising,” Tearney told me. “We have to make sure they are safe for providers and patients” while bypassing the standard, protracted, ways of vetting new equipment, he said. On a separate call, Dr. Reza Farivar, a neuroscientist at McGill University, likened the effort to the Apollo 13 mission, “you know, when they had to build a filtration system out of tubes, and so on.” The New England Journal of Medicine recently predicted that the United States may need as many as a million ventilators, and estimates put the country’s current stock at no more than a hundred and sixty thousand. Some of these are non-functional, as Californians found out last week, when Los Angeles received a hundred and seventy broken ventilators from the federal emergency reserve. Farivar has put his brain research on hold to organize the Code Life Ventilator Challenge, a two-week competition to design a coronavirus-specific ventilator so simple that it can be built and deployed anywhere on the planet. The challenge comes with a hundred-and-forty-thousand-dollar prize from the Montreal General Hospital Foundation, and nearly seven hundred teams from all over the world have signed up to participate. “This is an all-hands-on-deck situation,” Farivar said. “All of us are anxious, but the antidote to anxiety is creativity.” A similar competition, the CoVent challenge, created by a group of fourth-year anesthesiology residents at Massachusetts General Hospital, is just getting under way. “The ventilators that are used in the I.C.U. cost twenty to thirty thousand dollars and have millions of parts,” Dr. Richard Boyer, the founder and director of the challenge, told me. “We’re looking for something less sophisticated, that can keep someone alive.” These efforts join a number of global crowdsourced initiatives, like #ProjectOpenAir, in Portugal, Open Source Ventilator, in Ireland, and M.I.T.’s E-Vent project, in which participants are trying to create an emergency ventilator by mechanizing a manual resuscitation bag. For Boyer, who is just coming off a fourteen-day quarantine after being exposed to the coronavirus, the challenge is personal: he and the other anesthesiology residents are responsible for intubating patients and controlling their mechanical ventilators. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media One of the people on the Center for covid Innovation call was Dan Baker, in Nashville. Baker is the global supply chain officer at Smile Direct Club, a company that makes “invisible” aligners. It turns out that a printed nylon his company uses can be employed to fabricate face shields. On Friday, Smile Direct Club shipped its first thousand face shields to a hospital in Boise, Idaho. Baker and his crew are also figuring out how to make N95-like filtration masks that snap together like Legos. “Our R. & D. and engineering team was in the lab all weekend,” Baker told me, “working like mad scientists, pulling designs off the Internet, making different things. We’re at the final stages of designing and testing to prove the efficacy of the design to enable multiple use, that they can be sterilized and used safely.” The mask is a Class II medical device which requires approval from the F.D.A. Once they get the go-ahead, he estimates that Smile Direct Club can crank out three thousand masks a day, repurposing thirty to sixty of the company’s industrial 3-D printers to do so. Last week, shortly before the White House was set to announce a collaboration between General Motors and Ventec Life Systems to retool a car-parts factory to produce ventilators, Trump balked at its billion-dollar price tag. (He later invoked the Defense Production Act and ordered G.M. to make ventilators, though a G.M. spokesperson said that this directive did not change its production plans.) Retooling a 3-D printer, by contrast, is a matter of changing its software to design and model the item being produced. Industrial 3-D printers are now so sophisticated that they are used to make prosthetics, airplane parts, and hip replacements. “With 3-D printing, we can go from design to production within an hour,” Ramon Pastor, the acting president of 3-D printing and manufacturing at HP Inc., told me. “But in traditional manufacturing you have to work from a mold, and the mold has to be made first.” Pastor, who lives and works in Barcelona, watched the virus rip through his country and ravage the medical community. HP has turned its research-and-development centers in Spain and the United States into factories for face masks, face shields, mask adjusters, nasal swabs, hands-free door openers, and respirator parts. And HP has mobilized a network of its customers, including Smile Direct Club, to do the same, sending out designs that they can print locally, at scale. “We’ve realized that in moments of crisis, having digital factories and a distributed supply chain is a good thing,” Pastor said. HP is also collaborating with researchers to make splitters so that existing ventilators can be shared, and participating in the global effort to design and manufacture field ventilators. Pastor had just received word that the F.D.A. had approved an exemption for 3-D-printed nasal-testing swabs, and expected that H.P. would soon be shipping a million of them a week. Formlabs, a 3-D-printing company whose printers are used by hospitals to make pre-operative models, are ramping up the production of nasal swabs to fast-track tests. Gaurav Manchanda, Formlabs’ Director of Healthcare, estimates that, between the company’s two hundred in-house 3-D printers and those of its customers, they will be able to produce up to a hundred thousand swabs a day at peak capacity. They will begin to be shipped to testing centers in New York and Florida this week. “It’s taken about two weeks to go from an idea to something we can offer patients,” Manchanda said. As for Keefe and Budmen, after they produced the three hundred face shields for Onondaga County, they published their design on the Internet, and devoted their Web site to connecting those in need of P.P.E.—health-care workers, first responders, prison medical personnel—with those who can print them. A local film company is running the logistics. The couple’s fourteen industrial 3-D printers, each of which is able to produce one face shield an hour, are running day and night. So, it seems, are Budmen and Keefe. (The first time I spoke with Budmen, it was nearly midnight.) “It’s been a little overwhelming,” he said. “When we talk to people on the front lines, it’s hard not to take their urgency as our urgency, and their panic as our panic. At the same time, it’s amazing to see how many people are willing to give everything they have to help.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Keeping the Coronavirus from Infecting Health-Care Workers,13094,"The message is getting out: #StayHome. In this early phase of the coronavirus pandemic, with undetected cases accelerating transmission even as testing ramps up, that is critical. But there are many people whom the country needs to keep going into work—grocery cashiers, first responders, factory workers for critical businesses. Most obviously, we need health-care workers to care for the sick, even though their jobs carry the greatest risk of exposure. How do we keep them seeing patients rather than becoming patients? In the index outbreak in Wuhan, thirteen hundred health-care workers became infected; their likelihood of infection was more than three times as high as the general population. When they went back home to their families, they became prime vectors of transmission. The city began to run out of doctors and nurses. Forty-two thousand more had to be brought in from elsewhere to treat the sick. Luckily, methods were found that protected all the new health-care workers: none—zero—were infected. But those methods were Draconian. As the city was locked down and cut off from outside visitors, health-care workers seeing at-risk patients were housed away from their families. They wore full-body protective gear, including goggles, complete head coverings, N95 particle-filtering masks, and hazmat-style suits. Could we do that here? Not a chance. Health-care facilities don’t remotely have the supplies that would allow staff members to see every patient with all that gear on. In Massachusetts, where I practice surgery, the virus is circulating in at least eleven of our fourteen counties, and cases are climbing rapidly. So what happens if you are exposed to a coronavirus patient and you don’t have the ability to go full Wuhan? My hospital system, Partners HealthCare, has already sent more than a hundred staff members home for fourteen days of self-quarantine because they were exposed to the coronavirus without complete protection. If we had to quarantine every health-care worker who might have come into contact with a covid-19 patient, we’d soon have no health-care workers left. Yet there are lessons to be learned from two places that saw the new coronavirus before we did and that have had success in controlling its spread. Hong Kong and Singapore—both the size of my state—detected their first cases in late January, and the number of cases escalated rapidly. Officials banned large gatherings, directed people to work from home, and encouraged social distancing. Testing was ramped up as quickly as possible. But even these measures were never going to be enough if the virus kept propagating among health-care workers and facilities. Primary-care clinics and hospitals in the two countries, like in the U.S., didn’t have enough gowns and N95 masks, and, at first, tests weren’t widely available. After six weeks, though, they had a handle on the outbreak. Hospitals weren’t overrun with patients. By now, businesses and government offices have even begun reopening, and focus has shifted to controlling the cases coming into the country. Here are their key tactics, drawn from official documents and discussions I’ve had with health-care leaders in each place. All health-care workers are expected to wear regular surgical masks for all patient interactions, to use gloves and proper hand hygiene, and to disinfect all surfaces in between patient consults. Patients with suspicious symptoms (a low-grade fever coupled with a cough, respiratory complaints, fatigue, or muscle aches) or exposures (travel to places with viral spread or contact with someone who tested positive) are separated from the rest of the patient population, and treated—wherever possible—in separate respiratory wards and clinics, in separate locations, with separate teams. Social distancing is practiced within clinics and hospitals: waiting-room chairs are placed six feet apart; direct interactions among staff members are conducted at a distance; doctors and patients stay six feet apart except during examinations. What’s equally interesting is what they don’t do. The use of N95 masks, face-protectors, goggles, and gowns are reserved for procedures where respiratory secretions can be aerosolized (for example, intubating a patient for anesthesia) and for known or suspected cases of covid-19. Their quarantine policies are more nuanced, too. What happens when someone unexpectedly tests positive—say, a hospital co-worker or a patient in a primary-care office or an emergency room? In Hong Kong and Singapore, they don’t shut the place down or put everyone under home quarantine. They do their best to trace every contact and then quarantine only those who had close contact with the infected person. In Hong Kong, “close contact” means fifteen minutes at a distance of less than six feet and without the use of a surgical mask; in Singapore, thirty minutes. If the exposure is shorter than the prescribed limit but within six feet for more than two minutes, workers can stay on the job if they wear a surgical mask and have twice-daily temperature checks. People who have had brief, incidental contact are just asked to monitor themselves for symptoms. The fact that these measures have succeeded in flattening the covid-19 curve carries some hopeful implications. One is that this coronavirus, even though it appears to be more contagious than the flu, can still be managed by the standard public-health playbook: social distancing, basic hand hygiene and cleaning, targeted isolation and quarantine of the ill and those with high-risk exposure, a surge in health-care capacity (supplies, testing, personnel, wards), and coördinated, unified public communications with clear, transparent, up-to-date guidelines and data. Our government officials have been unforgivably slow to get these in place. We’ve been playing from behind. But we now seem to be moving in the right direction, and the experience in Asia suggests that extraordinary precautions don’t seem to be required to stop it. Those of us who must go out into the world and have contact with people don’t have to panic if we find out that someone with the coronavirus has been in the same room or stood closer than we wanted for a moment. Transmission seems to occur primarily through sustained exposure in the absence of basic protection or through the lack of hand hygiene after contact with secretions. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Consider a couple of data points. Singapore so far appears not to have had a single recorded health-care-related transmission of the coronavirus, despite the hundreds of cases that its medical system has had to deal with. That includes one case reported this week of a critically ill pneumonia patient who exposed forty-one health-care workers in the course of four days before being diagnosed with covid-19. These were high-risk exposures, including exposures during intubation and hands-on intensive care. Eighty-five per cent of the workers used only surgical masks. Yet, owing to proper hand hygiene, none became infected. Our early experiences in the U.S. have so far been similar. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the face of limited information, recommended stricter precautions than have been employed in Asia, putting health-care workers on fourteen-day self-quarantine if they are exposed to an infected person for even a few minutes without protection, including a mask and goggles. That policy was implemented at U.C. Davis Medical Center, where the first case of community transmission was diagnosed, in late February. Eighty-nine health-care workers involved in the patient’s care were put under self-quarantine. None, it turned out, had been infected. Sacramento, Seattle, and San Francisco became coronavirus hot spots; as of this writing, however, significant occupational transmission has not been found. Meanwhile, the strict policy has been threatening to close entire emergency departments. So, out of necessity and based on the early evidence, public-health authorities in San Francisco have loosened restrictions, letting exposed employees stay at work as long as they wear a surgical mask and don’t have symptoms. At least one hospital in Seattle is now following a similar policy, with the support of state public-health officials and the C.D.C. Other hospitals across the country will likely soon follow. The factors that appear to be important in protecting health-care workers from the disease have been insuring meticulous hand hygiene and cleaning; restricting clinics and hospitals to necessary patient visits; shifting as much care as possible to virtual channels (such as phone and video); and applying standard droplet precautions (surgical mask, gloves, and gown) with respiratory patients. For those who cannot stay home, the lesson is that it is feasible to work and stay coronavirus-free, despite the risks. Deborah Yokoe, the medical director of hospital epidemiology and infection prevention at U.C.S.F. Medical Center, told me that, given the safety practices in the hospital, she is seeing a greater likelihood of staff picking up infections at home than at work. Following this logic, San Francisco public-health officials are pushing medical facilities to have all health-care workers—not just those who have had patient exposures—report whether they have fever or flu symptoms prior to starting work each day. In South Korea, the success of mass testing in containing the spread of the disease has raised the possibility that asymptomatic carriers were causing outbreaks. But another implication of the experience in Singapore and Hong Kong is that these essentially invisible cases of the coronavirus may not be driving as many serious infections as some scientists have projected. Health officials there did not conduct mass testing of the population to look for infected people without symptoms. They focussed on aggressively searching out and testing only those who developed suspicious symptoms or had high-risk exposures in the community. They accepted that the virus might circulate among people who notice nothing. Yet their strategy brought cases under control. There are a number of possible explanations for this. One is that truly asymptomatic cases—people who never develop symptoms that would prompt evaluation—may be less common than feared. In Wuhan, where testing became widespread and more than seventy-two thousand coronavirus cases were identified, just one per cent never developed symptoms. Aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where, following an outbreak, more than three thousand passengers and crew were quarantined and tested—allowing one of the most complete evaluations of any affected population—six hundred and thirty-four people proved to have the virus. Most had no symptoms at the time of testing, but they proved to be pre-symptomatic: over several days, they developed recognizable signs of the disease. Just eighteen per cent were persistently asymptomatic. We know that people are less contagious while they have no symptoms, but not how much less. The success that Hong Kong and Singapore achieved by screening for people with fever- or flu-like symptoms suggests that the risk of asymptomatic contagion could be much lower than we thought. That experience gives some guidance for what to do not only in health care but wherever the coronavirus is circulating and people have to go physically into work. There’ll be more information as testing expands and we continue to adjust our strategies. Nonetheless, we are finding our way. When you have no choice but to leave home and go in to work while the case counts rise around you, it is hard not to panic. But we can learn from the experiences of our colleagues across the planet.

A Hostage-Taker Dies in Iran and Other Coronavirus Stories,10651,"Hossein Sheikholeslam spent years studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, before he returned to Iran, in 1979, to join the revolution and to participate in the takeover of the U.S. Embassy. “I was there all four hundred and forty-four days,” he recalled, the last time I saw him, in Tehran, in 2015. “I helped put together and translate the classified cables that the Americans had shredded.” He went on to become a member of parliament, the Ambassador to Syria, and the deputy foreign minister. He was one of the leading figures in Iran’s attempt to export its revolutionary ideology. He had been in Syria and Lebanon days before a suicide bomber drove into the barracks of U.S. Marine peacekeepers in Beirut, in 1983. In 2015, we had a painfully long argument about why the regime still rallied its followers to shout “Death to America” at public events more than three decades later. Sheikholeslam, who by then had a silvery beard and six children, had been nicknamed Gap Tooth by the hostages, for obvious reasons. I asked him if he knew that. He grinned wide enough to show me that the gap was gone. “It’s artificial,” he said, tapping his front teeth. Sheikholeslam died, on Thursday, of covid-19, which is caused by the new coronavirus. He was the latest in a growing list of Iranian officials to be felled by the disease. Eight per cent of Iran’s parliament has been infected; two members have died. In just the past two weeks, the number of covid-19 cases in Iran has soared to more than forty-seven hundred—up more than a thousand in just a day. In Qom, the holy city that is the epicenter of the outbreak, the cemetery has been unable to keep up with the number of deaths. On Wednesday, the BBC Persian Service posted a cell-phone video showing row after row of black body bags awaiting burial in Qom. Other videos show men wearing hazmat suits lowering shrouded bodies into the ground. Iran is one of the epicenters of the global disease that, as of Friday morning, had infected more than a hundred thousand and killed more than thirty-four hundred globally. Iran’s official death toll is a hundred and twenty-four, although unofficial accounts claim that it may be significantly higher. On all six inhabited continents, covid-19 is transforming human life. Some three million children are not attending school in eleven countries in Europe and Asia, with millions more ordered to stay at home in partial closures in the United States and Europe, according to unesco. “We are working with countries to assure the continuity of learning for all,” unesco’s director-general, Audrey Azoulay, said in a statement. “The global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and, if prolonged, could threaten the right to education.” On Thursday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, issued a global warning. “This is not a drill,” he said. “This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops.” In a worst-case scenario, governments face being crippled by the outbreak. Britain is drawing up plans to suspend Parliament for up to five months—until September—to contain the spread of the virus, the Times of London reported. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, predicted that the economic setbacks from the epidemic will more than wipe out expected growth in the global economy in 2020. covid-19 has so far hit eighty-nine of the I.M.F.’s hundred and eighty-nine member states. The World Health Organization has advised against using cash, because bills can be a means of transmission. The virus can cling to any currency; it doesn’t distinguish between dollars, dinars, yen, yuan, rials, rubles, or escudos. China and South Korea have started sterilizing their currency and then quarantining it for fourteen days to stem contagion. By Friday morning, the virus had spread to at least twenty-one American states. Schools were closed in Washington State, which had the most significant outbreak. Major conferences—the American Bar Association conference on white-collar crime, in San Diego; the American Physical Society meeting of physicists, in Denver; Facebook’s F8 developer conference, in Houston—were cancelled. President Trump was scheduled to speak next week at the annual Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society meeting, in Orlando. It usually draws tens of thousands of attendees but it, too, has been cancelled—for the first time in fifty-eight years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, has banned all nonessential travel by staff, according to USA Today. The global response has been complicated by the lack of definitive knowledge about the basics of the new coronavirus—from the pattern and pace of transmission to the mortality rate. Most data is currently based on preliminary and often cursory information. A study released on Tuesday identified two types—an aggressive and predominant L strain and an ancestral S strain. The new coronavirus is widely believed to have been transmitted first by an animal to a human in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but, this week, a dog in Hong Kong is reported to have tested “weak positive” for the coronavirus, most likely transmitted by a human. The government warned owners not to kiss their pets. In Iran, the eighty-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made a rare appearance in public this week—wearing latex gloves—to plant a tree in honor of National Arbor Day. One of his advisers—and the adviser’s mother—died of the virus this week. The revolutionaries have described their theocracy as “the government of God.” But Khamenei told Iranians this week that they’re now on their own when it comes to the disease. “God has obliged us to feel responsible for our own health and that of others,” he said, in remarks on national television, on Tuesday. “Anything that helps prevent the spread of coronavirus is a good deed, and anything that helps spread it is a sin.” The same day, Khamenei ordered the mobilization of more than three hundred thousand security forces, including Revolutionary Guards, Basij paramilitary forces, and firefighters, to help test Iranians for the disease, sanitize public venues, set up checkpoints, and trace the trail of patient infections. In Qom, the Revolutionary Guards used armored vehicles, adorned with banners declaring “Operation Crackdown on Coronavirus,” to spray major streets with disinfectants. In Tehran, the parliament was suspended indefinitely. “These people have a close relationship with the people and they carry different viruses from different parts of the country, which may create a new virus, so we recommend the lawmakers to cut off their relationship with the public for now,” Abdolreza Mesri, the deputy speaker of parliament, said. In Golestan, another hard-hit province, the government used drones to sprinkle hospitals, mosques, and public buildings. On Thursday, the government announced that checkpoints would be set up across the country to limit travel and prevent wider contagion. “Many cars on the roads are taking the virus with them,” the Health Minister, Saeed Namaki, said in a press conference. The C.D.C. says that it is possible to spread the disease on surfaces but that the primary transmission is through person-to-person contact. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? In a reflection of how widely the virus has spread, Iran this week also announced that it would temporarily release more than fifty-four thousand prisoners—almost a quarter of its prison population—because of an outbreak of covid-19 in three jails, including the notorious Evin Prison, in Tehran. Prisoners deemed dangerous to the public or who had long sentences for major crimes were not eligible; anyone who was released also had to post a large bail. Some key political prisoners, including Americans and dual nationals, were not furloughed, according to media accounts. Siamak Namazi, an American citizen being held in Evin, is now at “serious risk,” because a prisoner in a nearby cell was diagnosed with the coronavirus and quarantined too late to prevent contagion, Jared Genser, Namazi’s pro-bono lawyer in Washington, said this week. Namazi, a businessman, was arrested while visiting his parents, in 2015, and subsequently convicted of “collaboration with a hostile government.” He was sentenced to a decade in prison. “To keep Siamak at Evin prison in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak and without access to testing or even basic medicines constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in violation of Iran’s obligations under the Convention Against Torture,” Genser said, in a statement. The mother of Michael White, an American who was arrested in Iran while visiting his fiancée, in 2018, appealed for his release. White has cancer. He was sentenced to ten years in prison for purportedly insulting the Supreme Leader and posting private information online, charges that he denies. U.S. officials consider White to be a new kind of hostage held unjustly in the Islamic Republic. Iran cancelled a scheduled visit by a diplomat from the Swiss Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in Iran. White’s mother, Joanne, told the Associated Press, “If something’s not done, he’s going to die over there.” How much of the world is likely to be quarantined? Donald Trump in the time of coronavirus.

"The Queer Opposition to Pete Buttigieg, Explained",9089,"By now, you may have heard that some queer people think that Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a current contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination, is not gay enough. Unless you are immersed in this conversation with other queer people, you may have thought, “That’s ridiculous.” I am here to explain. The notion that some of us think Buttigieg is not gay enough has an identifiable relationship to the facts, which are that, for the purposes of this discussion, people who grew up queer in this country fall into two distinct categories of experience. One is the experience of never fitting in, being bullied by classmates for the way you walk, the way you look in clothes, the way you hit or fail to hit—all the things that set you apart before you have language to describe them. The novelist and essayist Alexander Chee has written, “In the second grade, the boys would stop me in the hall to tell me I walked like a girl, my hips switching.” Millions of people have had a version of that experience. And then there is the other experience, the life of blending in, only to surprise your classmates—or, more likely, former classmates who follow you on social media—with the revelation that you are gay. I am not arguing that one category of experience is worse or more difficult or painful than the other. There are people who revel in their specialness from an early age, and there are people who fit in but feel tormented by their deep secret. I am saying only that these two kinds of experience are very different. Though as grownups we have more control over our appearance and performance, the gap in experience follows us into adulthood. Recently, a friend mentioned that, after thirty years of teaching, she had mentioned her wife in class for the first time, surprising her students with the revelation that she was gay—and I found myself momentarily marvelling at having the option to come out to one’s students or not. As part of his campaign, and in developing his political persona, Buttigieg has repeatedly told a compelling story about his coming out. His is the story of someone who blended in and was therefore able—or, one might say, forced—to choose the circumstances and timing of his coming out. He chose to wait a long time: until after he graduated from college, after he had served in the military, after he had been elected mayor. He has made it clear that he feared that, if he had come out sooner, his political career might have suffered. But he didn’t just wait until he was established in his political career. He also waited until after attitudes toward homosexuality had changed and same-sex marriage had become legal in more than half the states and was recognized by the federal government—all thanks to the courage and work of people who came out before Buttigieg did. Then, in 2015, he had the chutzpah to write an op-ed titled “Why Coming Out Matters,” in which he praised himself for “putting something this personal on the pages of a newspaper.” Many a reader might have wondered, as I did when my friend mentioned her relationship with her students, what it must be like to have the option of not being exposed. Again, I am not saying that L.G.B.T. people who don’t pass are somehow morally superior to L.G.B.T. people who do. But these two distinct experiences are in some ways correlated with two divergent tracks in L.G.B.T. politics. One kind of queer politics is rooted in ideas of liberation, revolutionary change, and solidarity. The vision of this politics is a society that is radically changed by many kinds of people fighting many kinds of injustice, a society in which economic, social, political, and sexual relationships have been transformed. The roots of this politics are acknowledged in an open letter authored by a group called Queers Against Pete. (The letter was signed, according to the organizers, by more than two thousand people.) They wrote, “We are clear that LGBTQIA people are directly and disproportionately impacted by police violence, incarceration, unaffordable healthcare, homelessness, deportation, and economic inequality among other things.” The strategy of this brand of politics is to work across differences to bring about change. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold The other, more mainstream, and often more visible kind of L.G.B.T. politics aims to erase difference. Its message to straight people is “We are just like you, and all we want is the right to have what you have: marriage, children, a house with a picket fence, and the right to serve in the military.” The vision of this politics is a society in all respects indistinguishable from the one in which we live now, except queer people have successfully and permanently blended in. To be sure, all kinds of queer people have been involved in both kinds of queer politics. But the politics of being “just like you” leaves out the people who cannot or do not want to be just like conventional straight people, whether in appearance or in the way we construct our lives and families. Buttigieg embodies the second kind of gay experience and the second kind of gay politics. In a beautiful essay published in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Greta LaFleur, a professor of American studies at Yale, analyzed a photograph of Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, that appeared on the cover of Time magazine in May of last year. “This photo is about a lot of things,” LaFleur wrote. “But one of its defining features is its heterosexuality. It’s offering us the promise that our first gay first family might actually be a straight one.” Time had captioned the photo “First Family.” How can a family that consists of two men be heterosexual? LaFleur’s use of the term is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but she explains that the “unmistakable heraldry of ‘FIRST FAMILY,’ alongside the rest of the photograph—the tulips; the Chinos; the notably charming but insistently generic porch; the awkwardly minimal touching that invokes the most uncomfortable, unfamiliar, culturally-heterosexual embrace any of us have ever received—offers a vision of heterosexuality without straight people.” And without women. Buttigieg is the ultimate candidate of the country’s post-2016 trauma. He is not a woman. He is not a socialist. He is decidedly not a revolutionary. He does not make big, sweeping promises, except one: that nothing much will change, only Donald Trump won’t be President. “What I like about Mayor Pete is that he is not a strong ideologue,” Tod Sedgwick, a volunteer who had gone to New Hampshire to canvass for Buttigieg, told me. Sedgwick, who is seventy-one and the former U.S. Ambassador to the Slovak Republic, was canvassing with his girlfriend, Christina Brown, a seventy-three-year-old community activist from Louisville, Kentucky. Sedgwick lives in Washington, D.C. The couple had seen “Agrippina” at the Metropolitan Opera before flying to Boston to drive to New Hampshire. They both thought that Buttigieg’s ability to speak about his Christian faith, among other things, helps make him the best candidate. “We need Pete’s contemporaries to be leading,” Brown said. (Her own three grown children, she added, are not as enthusiastic about Buttigieg, a millennial, as she is: of the current contenders, they prefer Elizabeth Warren, one of the oldest of the baby boomers.) Likewise, Margaret Coulter, a fifty-eight-year-old nonprofit director in Newport, New Hampshire, told me that she liked Buttigieg because she was “leaning toward a younger person as we move into the Internet age.” What makes Buttigieg an easy and reassuring choice for these older, white, straight people, and a disturbing possibility for the queer people who seem to be criticizing him for not being gay enough? It is that he is profoundly, essentially conservative. He is an old politician in a young man’s body, a straight politician in a gay man’s body.

The Contrarian Coronavirus Theory That Informed the Trump Administration,29784,"President Trump, who at one point called the coronavirus pandemic an “invisible enemy” and said it made him a “wartime President,” has in recent days questioned its seriousness, tweeting, “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.” Trump said repeatedly that he wanted the country to reopen by Easter, April 12th, contradicting the advice of most health officials. (On Sunday, he backed down and extended federal social-distancing guidelines for at least another month.) According to the Washington Post, “Conservatives close to Trump and numerous administration officials have been circulating an article by Richard A. Epstein of the Hoover Institution, titled ‘Coronavirus Perspective,’ which plays down the extent of the spread and the threat.” Epstein, a professor at New York University School of Law, published the article on the Web site of the Hoover Institution, on March 16th. In it, he questioned the World Health Organization’s decision to declare the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, said that “public officials have gone overboard,” and suggested that about five hundred people would die from covid-19 in the U.S. Epstein later updated his estimate to five thousand, saying that the previous number had been an error. So far, there have been more than two thousand coronavirus-related fatalities in America; epidemiologists’ projections of the total deaths range widely, depending on the success of social distancing and the availability of medical resources, but they tend to be much higher than Epstein’s. (On Sunday, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that there could be between a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand deaths in the U.S.) In a follow-up article, published on March 23rd and titled “Coronavirus Overreaction,” Epstein wrote, “Progressives think they can run everyone’s lives through central planning, but the state of the economy suggests otherwise. Looking at the costs, the public commands have led to a crash in the stock market, and may only save a small fraction of the lives that are at risk.” Epstein has long been one of the most cited legal scholars in the country, and is known for his libertarian-minded reading of the Constitution, which envisions a restrained federal government that respects private property. He has also been known to engage with controversial subjects; last fall, he published an article on the Hoover Institution Web site that argued, “The professional skeptics are right: there is today no compelling evidence of an impending climate emergency.” Last Wednesday, I spoke by phone with Epstein about his views of the coronavirus pandemic. He was initially wary of talking, and asked to record his own version of the call, which I agreed to. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, Epstein made a number of comments about viruses that have been strongly disputed by medical professionals. We have included factual corrections alongside those statements. What did you want to achieve with your pieces? What did I want to achieve with my pieces? First of all, I am not a politician. What I did is that I looked at the standard model that was put out in the New York Times [in an Op-Ed by Nicholas Kristof and Stuart A. Thompson, published on March 13th], which was backed up by other models in other places, and it occurred to me that I just did not think that the underlying assumptions there were sound. The single most important thing to me was not to get my own estimate of what the number is. The most important thing was to look at that curve, which seemed to suggest that there would be ten million cases a day during a ten-day or so band in the middle of July, and to explain why, in relationship to all other things I know about evolutionary theory, that this just has to be wrong. The better way to have phrased the paper would have been to say that the traditional models, which were used for the last flu season, for the 2009 H1N1 situation, are much better approximations of what is likely to happen than these rather scary kinds of projections. You wrote last week, “In the United States, if the total death toll increases at about the same rate, the current 67 deaths should translate into about 500 deaths at the end.” We are currently at eight hundred deaths—over eight hundred deaths. [This was true when we spoke; the number is now over two thousand.] First of all, let me just say I wrote an amendment to that, the thing I regret most in that whole paper. But I was not so much interested in explaining why my number was right. I was interested in explaining why the other projections were wrong. O.K., but your number was surpassed in about a week, and now we’re already— I understand that, but the point about that is that, first of all, there was a simple stupid error, which is you would never want to put it in a model that total deaths in the United States relative to the world would be one per cent. So if you just inflated it to five per cent or ten per cent, then all of a sudden you’ve got a number which is either five or ten times as high. Secondly, suppose I should have been wiser in this and said, as I referred to the flu vaccine and later on to the H1N1 situation, if those are your benchmarks, then the number goes up to, say, between fifteen thousand and forty thousand deaths, as opposed to the one million-plus that are projected. [The Times model projected, without interventions by governments or citizens, a million deaths in the U.S.; with such interventions, the model showed that number dramatically decreasing.] And, remember, the one million-plus is on a model which is universal and worldwide, and you should expect to see something like that somewhere else. And there’s no evidence whatsoever that any of the situations, even in Italy, is going to approach the kinds of numbers that you had there. And so I am truly sorry about that [five hundred] number. I regard it as the single worst public-relations gaffe I’ve made in my entire life. But the question to ask, Isaac, is not whether I chose the right number but whether I had the right model. Something else you wrote, in an earlier piece, was, “Why has there been such a dramatic mismatch in the responses to ordinary flu and the coronavirus?” Is that a question you’re still unsure about? Look, the basic problem is, I think, in effect, that the tendency on the part of many people to treat this particular thing as unique is a mistake. There’s an underlying, standard model that you want to use, and the question is how you stuff it full of parameters. That is, numbers you add into it to make what’s going on. And, so, the situation that you get is you cannot use any exponential system because essentially then everybody is going to be dead, because things just keep doubling, doubling, and doubling. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures So you have to develop a model which is going to explain why there’s a fairly rapid increase at the outset, and then why the thing starts to turn flat, ultimately down, and then disappears. That’s the strategy that you have to do. And so the theory here is one that I actually worked with and I thought worked pretty well in the aids stuff, which I worked on back in the early nineteen-eighties. And the model goes something like this. You start off with this virus, and there’s a range, some of which are very serious and some of which are less, so it’s a theory of natural selection with a normal distribution set. And, if you’re moving into a new environment like the [Life Care Center] of Kirkland or like the cruise ship, what happens is you have people who are completely unaware of what is going on. And so you take a population like in Kirkland, which is fragile and old, you get somebody in who has a strong version of the virus, and the thing will just absolutely rip through the population and kill everybody in it within a very short period of time. [Daniel Kuritzkes, the chief of the infectious-diseases division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, said, after being read this passage, “There’s no evidence that there are strong and weak variations of the coronavirus circulating. There may be minor variations person to person or location to location in the actual genetic sequence, but there is no evidence that they have different virulence or that a less virulent version is overtaking a more virulent version.”] And Washington State had a very high peak early on. And, probably, most of the deaths that we have today, if you went through and chased them down, were either people who are in the facility or people who have family members who hugged and kissed people in the facility. So they got large doses of intense viruses. [Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology and medicine and the department chair at the Yale School of Public Health, responded, “There is no evidence that you have a higher risk of dying from contact from someone in the facility than if you had contact from some other source.”] But then adaptation starts to set in. And, in my view, adaptation is a co-evolutionary process in which things change, not only in human behavior but also change in genetic viral behavior. So, on the human side, once you see that these things are really going to happen in this particular form, people take steps to avoid contact. You write, “I fully understand the need for immediate responses to immediate threats, like fires, but not for crises that may last for three months or more.” Yes. Well, I’m saying in effect, by this particular point—this is not the medical side—is after you start declaring emergencies you have time for reflection and adaptation and modification, which you don’t have in a fire case. So the political point is one which essentially says, when you see governors of three major states putting out statements that their experts have said this, that, and the other thing is a result, and you don’t see the studies and you can’t question the assumption, I regard that as a serious breakdown in the political process. So my view on that particular point is I’d like to know which of these studies they’re relying on. If it’s the New York Times studies, then I thought that that study was mistaken for the reasons that I was trying to give you a moment ago, which is that as the virus becomes more apparent, adaptive responses long before government gets involved become clear. You wrote, “The adaptive responses should reduce the exposures in the high-risk groups, given the tendency for the coronavirus to weaken over time.” What tendency are you talking about, and how do we know it will weaken over time? Well, what happens is it’s an evolutionary tendency. [“There is absolutely no evidence for that,” Ko told me. According to Kuritzkes, “There is no proof that this is the case. To the extent we see that evolution taking place it is usually over a much vaster timescale.”] So the mechanism is you start with people, some of whom have a very strong version of the virus, and some of whom have a very weak version of the virus. If the strong-version-of-the-virus people are in contact with other people before they die, it will pass on. But, if it turns out that you slow the time of interaction down, either in an individual case or in the aggregate, these people are more likely to die before they could transfer the virus off to everybody else. On the other hand, those people have the more benign version of the virus that will allow them to live longer, which means that they have the chance to make a connection with somebody else. And so what happens is, if it turns out you think something like the coronavirus is ten times as strong as another virus, what that means is that the distancing is going to be more violent, which means that the evolutionary process should be more rapid than that for the ordinary flu. But you stated as fact that the coronavirus has a tendency to weaken over time. Isaac, let me just explain it. This tendency takes time. It could be a week. It could be a month. It could be longer. But, in the end, you should expect something of this particular sort to take place. More importantly, on the other side, where there’s no dispute, it’s clear that people will start to evolve away from these things so that the rate of transmission will start to go down. And, as that starts to happen, whether you have just private or social responses, you’d expect the rate of transmission to go lower. So the question then is, How quickly will this thing peak? And, if you looked at the standard model, it basically postulated a very long buildup and a peak which is about three months away from now. And that just strikes me as being too high and too far relative to everything else that we have. So, in the United States, if you start looking at yesterday’s figures, it was about two per cent higher than the day before, which is already indicating that the speed-up is slowing down. We’re going to have to see what the next days do. But we’re talking ten thousand cases a day at the current maximum, and the flu was vastly larger in terms of its number and its extent. And my sense is, given the reactions that you’re going to have, this thing will peak earlier and start to decline earlier than the common models start to say, because they don’t seem to build in anything by way of adaptative responses. You keep talking about your “sense.” I think that’s the word you’re using. But you’re stating as a fact that the virus is going to weaken over time. It seems like we do not know that. We can turn to other viruses and how they’ve— No, that is not what I said. I said there’s a long-term tendency in these ways. Over time, yes. And is this a hundred-per-cent tendency? No. Is there any known exception to it? No. [“We did not see sars or Ebola weaken over time,” Kuritzkes said. “It is only appropriate public-health measures or vaccines that have helped to control those epidemics.”] It seems to me that if you do this, what you’re trying to do is to figure out what the probabilities are, and I think the answer is, if you look at all of the cases that we’ve seen, no matter what’s going on, even if you subtract out the coercion that was used in China and in Korea and so forth, you cannot come up with a credible story that those places in Korea would have had, say, a half a million cases a day. Or in China you would have had, say, thirty million cases a day. And so I do think that the tendency to weaken is there, and I’m willing to bet a great deal of money on it, in the sense that I think that this is right. And I think that the standard models that are put forward by the epidemiologists that have no built-in behavioral response to it— And you’re not an epidemiologist, correct? No, I’m trained in all of these things. I’ve done a lot of work in these particular areas. And one of the things that is most annoying about this debate is you see all sorts of people putting up expertise on these subjects, but they won’t let anybody question their particular judgment. One of the things you get as a lawyer is a skill of cross-examination. I spent an enormous amount of time over my career teaching medical people about some of this stuff, and their great strengths are procedures and diagnoses in the cases. Their great weakness is understanding general-equilibrium theory. O.K., so your expertise in the subject I guess comes in part from your work with aids, which you just referenced, is that right? aids, and I’ve worked on evolutionary theory for forty years in its relationship to law. You write, “There are two factors to consider. One is the age of the exposed population, and the other is the rate of change in the virulence of the virus as the rate of transmission slows, which should continue apace. By way of comparison, the virulent aids virus that killed wantonly in the 1980s crested and declined when it gave way to a milder form of virus years later once the condition was recognized and the bath houses were closed down.” [I read this passage to Kuritzkes, who responded, “It’s completely inaccurate. It had nothing to do with the change in the virus. We were able to do it by safe-sex practices and the like, and we saw the explosive growth of H.I.V. during the nineteen-nineties in sub-Saharan Africa and more recently in Eastern Europe. There is nothing about the virus that has become less virulent.”] What milder form of the virus are you talking about? Look, all it is is it’s a distribution. What you do is you figure out what this toxicity strength is and if it’s X at one point, then it’s going to be some fraction of X down the road. And it’s quite clear that that is what happened with aids. And then, when it comes along and you start getting [the antiretroviral drug] AZT and other conditions, it’s easier to treat them because all of a sudden aids is evolved in much the same path as syphilis. If you go through the history of syphilis, it starts off, it’s essentially a deadly disease and kills most people. And then those who survive have the milder version of it. And so after a while what happens is it becomes a tamer disease. [Syphilis is a bacterial infection, not a viral infection. “One doesn’t have anything to do with the other,” Kuritzkes said. Ko told me, “That’s not something that is based in empirical evidence, so the fallacy in his argument is the over-all lack of scientific rigor in his analysis.”] You’re saying that there’s a milder form of the H.I.V. virus than what was around in the eighties and nineties. That’s what you’re saying? Well, I mean, there’s always been a continuous distribution from severe to less severe. What I’m saying is the probability distribution switches so that the medium becomes a little more mild. And, if it becomes more mild, it kills fewer people. And, after a while, it becomes something that becomes a chronic disease of some sort or another instead of something that’s virulent. O.K., but you used the phrase a “milder form” of the virus, which I could find no scientific backup for, so I wanted to clarify that point. Well, I’m just telling you, I’m giving you this as a theory. Oh, it’s a theory. No, look, I’m not an empiricist, but, again, let me just be clear to you, because you’re much too skeptical. The evolutionary component has not been taken into account in these models, and so before one is so dismissive, what you really need to do is to get somebody who’s an expert on this stuff to look at the evolutionary theory and explain why a principle of natural selection doesn’t apply here. What I’m doing here is nothing exotic. I’m taking standard Darwinian economics—standard economic-evolutionary theory out of Darwin—and applying it to this particular case. And, if that’s wrong, somebody should tell me. But what happens is I just get these letters from people saying, “You’re not an expert. The H1 virus differs from this one in the following way.” What I don’t get from anybody is a systematic refutation which looks at the points parameter by parameter. I guess my point is that shouldn’t you be careful about offering up these theories before they’re printed? No. It turns out in this particular world if you become quiet about this stuff it never gets heard. And what we’ve had now is very loud talk on one side. I think most of it is incorrect. I’m always willing to debate somebody on the other side who wants to say this is the way the model works. In fact, I have several of my Hoover colleagues who have done exactly that. Richard, with all due respect, your article is apparently circulating in conservative circles in Washington and the White House. I didn’t write it as a conservative article. Donald Trump’s name is not mentioned in it. I grasped that. I’m not interested in politics. I know, but we have a responsibility when we put our name on something, no? I absolutely do. And I told you I’m willing to debate anybody and anywhere at any time on this particular topic, and we’ll see how it comes out. What was the last sentence in that article? Would you care to read it again? I’ve got it right here, I believe. “Perhaps my analysis is all wrong, even deeply flawed. But the stakes are too high to continue on the current course without reexamining the data and the erroneous models that are predicting doom.” Are the stakes too high to publish articles with basic errors? This is not a mistake. It’s an open challenge. I’ve spent my entire life as a lawyer taking on established wisdom. My view about it is what you’re asking me to do is, when I think everybody is wrong, to remain silent, and the stakes are too high. So my view is there’s all these experts on the other side. Somebody come up and explain why it is that they think the results are going to be different. Looking at the data thus far, both theories tend to predict a sharp rise at the beginning, mine less sharp than the one that’s coming out. In the next week or so, we’ll see. I will be, shall we say, much more compromised if we start to see a continuing explosion of deaths going on for two or three weeks. But, if the numbers start to level off, the curves will start to go downward. I was just asking about— I’m saying what I think to be the truth. I mean, I just find it incredible— I know, but these are scientific issues here. You know nothing about the subject but are so confident that you’re going to say that I’m a crackpot. No. Richard— That’s what you’re saying, isn’t it? That’s what you’re saying? I’m not saying anything of the sort. Admit to it. You’re saying I’m a crackpot. I’m not saying anything of the— Well, what am I then? I’m an amateur? You’re the great scholar on this? No, no. I’m not a great scholar on this. Tell me what you think about the quality of the work! O.K. I’m going to tell you. I think the fact that I am not a great scholar on this and I’m able to find these flaws or these holes in what you wrote is a sign that maybe you should’ve thought harder before writing it. What it shows is that you are a complete intellectual amateur. Period. O.K. Can I ask you one more question? You just don’t know anything about anything. You’re a journalist. Would you like to compare your résumé to mine? No, actually, I would not. Then good. Then maybe what you want to do is to say, “Gee, I’m not quite sure that this is right. I’m going to check with somebody else.” But, you want to come at me hard, I am going to come back harder at you. And then if I can’t jam my fingers down your throat, then I am not worth it. But you have basically gone over the line. If you want to ask questions, ask questions. I put forward a model. But a little bit of respect. O.K. Let me ask you this question. All my questions are asked with respect. That’s not the way I hear it. O.K. Let me ask you this question. This is an important point, so I want us to come to some sort of resolution on this, because I think it gets to the crux of what you’re saying. You write, “Moreover, it is unlikely that the healthcare system in the United States will be compromised in the same fashion as the Italian healthcare system in the wake of its quick viral spread. The amount of voluntary and forced separation in the United States has gotten very extensive very quickly, which should influence rates of infection sooner rather than later.” Here is what confused me. Are you saying we are overreacting, which seems to be the tone of the rest of the article, or are you saying that the measures we are taking are going to prevent an Italy-like disaster, in which case, why the complaints about the overwhelming response? Well, I think the answer is all of the above. If what I’m saying is correct, we should not expect to see many replications of what has happened in New York, where in fact the caseload here is actually lower than it was during the height of the flu season last year. [At the time of this interview, Epstein was correct. Now, however, the number of covid-19 cases surpasses it.] What’s happening is the amount of quarantine that we’re putting in has created strain on the system, because what we do now is we spend much more money per case than we did in the summer, because we have more respirators, more isolation, more special uniforms, more special ambulances, and so forth. But also on the other side we’re going to see a very strong reaction. The self-quarantine that you’re seeing taking place in New York, where I live, this is hugely voluntary. I have so many friends, not only are they going into quarantine, anybody who has a house in Connecticut or New Jersey, in the suburbs, they go out and they’re spreading this thing out there. It’s like the days in England when people would leave London during the plague and head off to Oxford. So I think all of these forces are going to take hold fairly quickly. And the Italian situation, well, what’s the problem there? This is a national health-care system, and the way in which national health-care systems ration, since they typically do not devote enough resources and they charge no prices, is they ration by queuing, which is they have people wait. And so the stories that come out of Italy, there was one in the Jerusalem Post, said that they had a consistent policy of not giving a respirator treatment to anybody who got the virus who was over sixty. Well, that’s going to clearly change the mortality rates. [Italy does not have a consistent policy on ventilators but has had to ration their use. New York City officials have warned that they, too, may run out of equipment. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “We’re going to need at least several hundred more ventilators very quickly.”] And, if you start looking at the mortality rates in Italy, ninety per cent or eighty-five per cent of the deaths are from people over seventy, which suggested something like this is going on. In the United States, we don’t have quite the skew, and we have a little bit better supply on things. I think we have a greater ability to ramp up in terms of things. So my guess is you will see real stresses in the short run in the New York area, but that given the time that’s available, I first of all did not think that the runoffs will be as great anywhere else throughout the system. All right? But, on the other hand, I think there’ll be more preparedness. My fear is that there will be overpreparedness if it turns out that the numbers that they’re preparing for are too high. Illinois declared that the state was on lockdown when they had twelve cases. By the way, Bill Gates agrees with me, I’m happy to say. What does he agree with you on? He thinks you have to relax the economic, lockdown restrictions. They are too severe. Just to clarify, this is from a Vox Recode article, “Bill Gates rebuked proposals, floated over the last two days by leaders like Donald Trump, to reopen the global economy despite the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, saying that this approach would be ‘very irresponsible.’ ” Gates said, “There really is no middle ground, and it’s very tough to say to people, ‘Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore the pile of bodies over in the corner. We want you to keep spending because maybe there’s a politician who thinks GDP growth is all that counts.’ It’s very irresponsible for someone to suggest we can have the best of both worlds.” I misread him then. Whatever Mr. Gates said, that’s fine. That strikes me as more populist than I am. The question is we managed to survive all of these things during the periods of flu vaccine. Nobody wants to trivialize death. You’re trying to minimize them. The point that I’m making is, you shut down the economy and put it on lockdown, you’re going to get medical deaths, when people don’t get adequate supervision and care for other kinds of conditions that also kill. Right. I think the point that Bill Gates and others are making is that if we don’t shut down the economy or large parts of it, we’re going to get the economic devastation anyway down the road, because we’re not going to stop the virus. That presupposes that the basic model is correct, that they’re relying on it. I think it is wrong. And the whole point of writing that article was to attack that model. Let’s put it this way: if in fact that model is right, it’s not at all clear that shutting down the economy will do any good, because it may well just be so devastating. And, if it’s wrong, it’s absolutely clear that the model is devastating. A previous version of this piece misstated the percentage of Italians over the age of seventy who died from covid-19.

The Engineers Taking on the Ventilator Shortage,32435,"On Monday, March 9th, Jake Kittell, a research engineer and machinist who builds scientific equipment for the University of Vermont, in Burlington, came into work fired up. Approaching another engineer, Carl Silver, he said, “We gotta build a ventilator.” “That sounds great,” Silver replied. “What do we know about ventilators?” Neither had ever seen one. But the coronavirus pandemic, once an abstraction, had recently made itself felt in Seattle, New York, and other American cities, and doctors had warned that a shortage of ventilators could hasten the deaths of thousands. “You feel like you want to do something,” Silver recalled. The next week, Kittell e-mailed another professor at the university, Jason Bates, with whom they had worked in the past, and whom they knew to be a lung expert. We have a shop, he wrote. Can we build a ventilator? Well, sure, Bates thought. He’d been working on the same problem for the previous four days. Bates has wispy white hair and speaks with lucid, cheery confidence. Originally from England, he is a professor of medicine and of biomedical engineering, and teaches in both the university’s engineering department and its medical school. The author of “Lung Mechanics: An Inverse Modeling Approach,” he is one of the world’s foremost experts on ventilator-induced lung injury, or vili. Earlier in his career, at McGill University, in Montreal, Bates and his team invented a computer-controlled ventilator for mice that is still used by researchers. By tuning the machine’s settings and seeing how a mouse’s lungs react under pressure, scientists can study the physiology of lung disease. They can also explore how different styles of ventilation—in which air is moved into and out of the lungs at various volumes, pressures, and rhythms—can help or hurt a damaged lung. The previous Friday, March 13th, Bates had heard from Matt Kinsey, a pulmonologist at the University of Vermont medical school. A covid-19 patient there had been placed on a ventilator, and the physician in charge had decided to use a technique known as airway pressure release ventilation, or A.P.R.V., in which the device delivers near-constant air pressure, with an occasional quick release. (Try taking a long, slow breath in, then puffing out, quickly but gently; repeat.) Kinsey passed on a text message from the physician: “APRV is da bomb for covid.” Bates said, “I was intrigued by this because I’d been studying A.P.R.V. and trying to figure out how to optimally deliver it.” He suspected that covid-19 inflicted more damage when the lungs were swinging between full inflation and full deflation, and had come to believe that A.P.R.V., by avoiding those extremes, was probably the gentlest ventilation strategy for those suffering from the disease. Now his theory was being put to the test. The ventilators used in today’s I.C.U.s are expensive, in large part because they are configurable. Newer models have touch screens that allow clinicians to change and track dozens of parameters, carefully adjusting how breaths are delivered. Bates began wondering whether it might be possible to build a pared-down ventilator that did nothing but provide A.P.R.V., to be used when the supply of fancier ventilators ran out. A typical I.C.U. ventilator costs between twenty-five thousand and fifty thousand dollars. Bates replied to Kittell’s e-mail with a document titled “APRV for $10 (okay, maybe $50 . . . ).” In an included schematic, Bates had sketched a simple device: a box with three holes in it. Gas under pressure—which many hospitals have available from wall outlets—would flow into one hole and out another, to the patient. In normal breathing, exhalation typically takes about two to three times as long as inhalation; in A.P.R.V., the length of exhalation is reduced from several seconds to about half a second, while inhalation can take five seconds or more. To create this modified rhythm, the box’s third hole would be blocked by a rotating disk that also had a hole in it, and that was spun by a motor. When the holes briefly aligned, the machine would exhale through the opening. By the next day, Silver had built a prototype and sent Bates a video. A rubber glove was attached to the side of a box with some zip ties. The glove inflated, then deflated, then inflated again. “I saw that and everything changed,” Bates said. Soon, the university agreed to fund the device. Kittell and Silver were given free rein in the shop; a lung analogue was brought in from the hospital for testing; a regulatory expert began preparing an emergency report for the Food and Drug Administration, which had created a special approval process for stopgap ventilators; and several local contract manufacturers were lined up so that the device, now known as the Vermontilator, could be mass-produced. Engineering is quiet, methodical work, not often the stuff of high drama. But for many engineers the coronavirus has been a call to arms. Not since the space race has the whole world been so invested in problems that are fundamentally technical. During the Apollo 13 mission, a buildup of carbon dioxide was slowly poisoning the crew; the nation watched as the astronauts, working with engineers in Mission Control, jury-rigged a filter using duct tape and spare parts. In the film “Apollo 13,” from 1995, an engineer with a pocket protector explains the situation to his colleagues: “The people upstairs handed us this one, and we gotta come through.” Since February, engineers in industry and academia have been working on designs for cheap, easy-to-build ventilators. Ford has christened its effort Project Apollo. And yet comparisons to the moon landings may understate the complexity of the problem. covid-19 is a mysterious illness, and ventilators admit to many styles of operation. In the best case, the machines keep patients with failing lungs alive, buying time for the body to heal. In the worst case, they can aggravate lung damage. In the course of the pandemic, critical-care specialists have disagreed about how the devices should be operated and at what point in a patient’s decline they should be used; mortality rates for covid-19 patients on ventilators have ranged widely. Manufacturing a ventilator is difficult, especially during a pandemic, when supply lines are unreliable. Different designs negotiate different bargains between cost and functionality. Reaching the moon is challenging enough. It’s harder when no one is sure where the moon is. The lung is a passive participant in breathing. It’s the diaphragm, a large muscle that cuts the human body horizontally in half, that does the work. When you inhale, your diaphragm pulls down like a piston, creating negative pressure around the lungs, while the muscles of the chest wall pull up and out. Air, drawn in through the nose and the mouth, flows through the trachea and into the bronchial tree, which fans out into the lungs. There, the breath nestles into hundreds of millions of gossamer sacs called alveoli. Blood, meanwhile, has arrived at the rendezvous through a network of capillaries, the smallest vessels in the circulatory system. Under a microscope, the alveoli look like bunches of grapes, and the capillaries like the mesh sacks that hold them. The tissues are so exquisitely thin that oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse across them, between air and blood. The contact surface between the two networks, if it were unfolded flat, would be more than half the size of a tennis court. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures The alveolar flesh is elastic, and delicate like fruit pulp. It fares poorly when infected. The coronavirus multiplies in the alveolar cells, tearing them apart as it escapes; in the resulting chaos, fluid can leak into the air sacs, capillaries can constrict or clot, and tissues can become inflamed and stiffen. As the infection spreads, the number of healthy air sacs declines, and the exchange of gases becomes less efficient. A patient whose lung function degrades in this way can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ards. When a covid-19 patient arrives at the hospital with shortness of breath, physicians use a pulse oximeter, clipped to a finger, to monitor her blood-oxygen level, while supplemental oxygen is delivered. If the oxygen level continues to decline, doctors bring in a ventilator. A device that looks like an oversized shoehorn is wedged over the patient’s tongue and used to peel back the epiglottis. Then a tube is fed down the trachea, where a small balloon is inflated to hold it in place. Patients are usually sedated and paralyzed before being intubated; people suffering from covid-19 may have to stay on ventilators for weeks, remaining sedated for the duration, and they are sometimes paralyzed again if their movement makes them hard to manage. It is an extreme intervention that, even when it saves a patient’s life, takes a toll on the body. At the most basic level, a ventilator is a pump, no different from the plastic resuscitator bags that paramedics squeeze to push air into a patient’s lungs, in lieu of mouth-to-mouth. But, to avoid vili, the lungs must be ventilated with care. Too little air pressure and the alveoli won’t inflate; too much and they’ll distend and get damaged. The balance grows harder to maintain as ards progresses. The lung is like a lattice, with each air sac supporting its neighbors. Damaged alveoli can press up against one another, spreading weakness with each breath; strained alveoli can burst. During exhalation, the insides of the alveoli, which get stickier as they fill with fluid, touch and cling together; inflating them again requires peeling them apart. In lung-physiology circles, this is sometimes called the “Velcro effect.” “If you have that Velcro effect going on with every single breath, breath after breath, that’s incredibly damaging in a fairly short time,” Bates said. “You get in this vicious spiral that’s really hard to get back from.” With a typical I.C.U. ventilator, a clinician has a few ways to modulate the flow of air. She can adjust the “tidal volume”—the total amount of air to be delivered with each breath. She can designate a target pressure, in which case the ventilator delivers whatever volume is required to generate it. (Imagine filling a bicycle tire: you pump until the tire is firm.) She can also select the degree of peep, or positive end-expiratory pressure—the amount of pressure that’s left in the lungs at the end of each exhalation. Higher peep prevents the air sacs from collapsing. By decreasing the duration of exhalation and maintaining higher inspiratory pressure, A.P.R.V., Bates’s preferred ventilation style, does everything possible to avoid the Velcro effect. The Vermontilator will likely cost around one or two thousand dollars when it ships—more than ten (or fifty) dollars, but a fraction of the cost of a full-fledged I.C.U. ventilator. It’s so inexpensive because it’s a minimalist device made from around fifteen parts, designed specifically for A.P.R.V. If the Velcro effect is as central to covid-19 as Bates believes it to be, then this is a sound approach. But clinicians and researchers are still debating what kind of lung damage the coronavirus causes; they have come to recognize that it affects patients in unpredictable ways. “One of our mistakes at the beginning of this mass-casualty event was fixation: you come in with an idée fixe,” Sharon Einav, an I.C.U. specialist in Jerusalem who co-authored a set of well-known guidelines for critical-care surges, told me. “People knew ards. The intensive-care community has been discussing ards for the last twenty years. As time passes, we’re discovering that this disease has something more to it.” The Vermontilator is a bet on the nature of the virus that may not pay off. If we could produce more of the high-end ventilators already in use in hospitals, doctors could choose their own settings. This is the cause now taken up by Ford and General Motors, which have each collaborated with a ventilator-maker—G.E. Healthcare, which licenses a design from Airon, and Ventec, respectively—to scale up manufacturing. In mid-March, Ford kicked off Project Apollo, after the company learned about Airon’s design; a personal introduction to representatives at Ventec led Mary T. Barra, the C.E.O. of G.M., to commit her company to Project V. Ventec’s vocsn ventilator—the name stands for “ventilator, oxygen, cough, suction, and nebulizer”—was designed to perform the functions of five devices in one. “We are the first and only multifunction ventilator,” Chris Brooks, the company’s chief strategy officer, told me. (The vocsn was approved by the F.D.A. in 2017.) For G.M., Ventec has created a simplified version, without the cough, suction, and nebulizer functions, known as the V+Pro. Even so, Brooks sees it as a fighter jet in a race with prop planes. “There’s been a lot of conversation over the past few weeks with the shortage, a lot of very well-intentioned individuals and groups and very smart people, who have said, ‘Hey, we can create a ventilator,’ and ‘Hey, we’ve developed a ventilator overnight, it’s a hundred-dollar ventilator,’ ” he said. “There’s a reason that there are very high-end, very powerful and precise critical-care I.C.U. ventilators. That truly is what these patients need.” On March 27th, in a tweet, President Trump urged G.M. to “START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”; in a subsequent tweet, he invoked the Defense Production Act to compel the company to do what it had started doing two weeks earlier. Preparing to manufacture ten thousand of Ventec’s ventilators per month, as G.M. plans to do, has required a crash effort. On March 19th, G.M. flew six engineers to Bothell, Washington, to study the vocsn production process. “We took a lot of pictures and a lot of video,” Gerald Johnson, G.M.’s head of global manufacturing, told me. The vocsn has around seven hundred parts; the V+Pro, around four hundred. By e-mailing lists of parts to around seventy of its “Tier 1” suppliers, G.M. was able to secure all of them by the following weekend. The scramble, Johnson said, was “miraculous.” Suppliers had to adapt production lines to new specifications; they had to ask their own suppliers to do the same. The most elusive part, a special DC motor, is being shipped from India, where it is being made in a factory that had closed and had to be reopened. With the parts secured, a G.M. component-manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, was retrofitted for ventilators. Two hundred and fifty skilled workers, recruited from within and outside G.M., began work after a week of training. A few dozen Ventec engineers are helping run the operation. At stations, each person takes on a sub-assembly task—plugging in a hose, mounting a circuit board with tiny screws—and then passes a bucket containing the incomplete ventilator to someone else. “Because of the urgency and speed, automation was kept down,” Johnson said. In mid-April, G.M. produced its first five units. Later in the month, the Kokomo plant and its trimmed-down ventilator were approved under an F.D.A. Emergency Use Authorization, and the first shipments were made to hospitals in Illinois and Indiana, at around sixteen thousand dollars per ventilator. (Ford is expected to begin delivering its first Airon ventilators by early July.) G.M. says that it is on pace to produce thirty thousand ventilators by the end of August. Between the parsimonious minimalism of the Vermontilator and the maximalist ambition of Project Apollo and Project V, some engineers have ended up taking a middle path. In mid-March, at around the same time that Bates connected with Kittell and Silver to develop a prototype of the Vermontilator, Scott Cohen, a co-founder of New Lab, a center for researchers and startups in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, began reading up on the global ventilator hackathon. A doctor in Detroit had used a T-tube to split one ventilator among two or four patients. At the University of Florida, engineers were using a sprinkler valve and PVC water pipes to drive what looked like a wheezy bellows. At Rice University, a bare-bones ventilator was being built out of a plastic resuscitator bag and a motor. Groups in Ireland and at M.I.T. were pursuing the same idea—all open source, with instructions and parts lists posted freely online. Cohen, who is not an engineer, turned to friends to help him find a project that New Lab could assist with. One wrote back immediately and said that M.I.T.’s effort was a good bet. The M.I.T. E-Vent, as the school’s ventilator is known, was based on a prototype that had been created ten years earlier, as a student project in a class on medical-device design. The students’ prototype ran on a battery for three and a half hours, and consisted of a resuscitator bag placed in an enclosure and squeezed by a motor-driven cam. It had a pressure sensor, and settings for tidal volume (squeeze more or less air from the bag) and breaths per minute (squeeze the bag more or less often). The idea had never been developed beyond the class, but it had been revived in early March, and was now being worked on by a team of alumni, professors, and graduate students from the mechanical-, civil-, electrical-, and environmental-engineering departments. The rig had been given to Albert Kwon, an anesthesiologist at Westchester Medical Center, in New York State, who had tested it on a live pig. By Porcine Study No. 4, the device was said to perform comparably to a commercial ventilator operated in a volume-control mode. The M.I.T. team aimed to build a “reference implementation”—a prototype that proved the viability of its design, which could then be shared for anyone to build. Like other open-source ventilator efforts, it had attracted interest not just from organizations staffed with experts but from amateurs who might try to build a device of their own. “I’m not in favor of this open-source—” Cohen said, interrupting himself. “It’s misleading at a critical time to have people cowboying devices.” He and his friend Marcel Botha, the founder of 10xBeta, a product-design and -development firm in New York, wanted to build the ventilators themselves, or to oversee their production. For a time, engineers in New York and Cambridge worked together; among other things, Botha persuaded Bon Ku, an emergency-medicine doctor at Thomas Jefferson Hospital, in Philadelphia, to loan the M.I.T. engineers one of his hospital’s ventilators, so that they could compare it with their prototypes. But, eventually, the designs “forked,” as often happens in open source. The New Lab team began calling its device the Spiro Wave, after the Latin word meaning “to breathe.” It has two hundred and fifteen parts; to avoid supply-chain problems, the engineers sourced as many of them as they could from within the state, and persuaded their suppliers to stay open as essential businesses. Under the vaulted ceilings of New Lab’s converted Navy hangar, and, later, at a manufacturing facility operated by Boyce Technologies, in Long Island City, a dozen engineers have been working day and night, in twelve-hour shifts, to perfect the design and solve production challenges. The group has received a ten-million-dollar purchase order from New York City: three thousand units, at $3,333 each. Regulatory experts were brought on to help push through an application for an F.D.A. Emergency Use Authorization. The device—still essentially a pair of robotic arms that squeeze a bag—has a slick metal casing and instructional videos. The Boyce facility is assembling about a hundred units per day. A similar story has unfolded on the West Coast. On Wednesday, March 11th, David Van Buren, a senior engineer at nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, began wondering if, under the circumstances, the lab was working on the right projects. He wrote an e-mail to colleagues proposing that perhaps they should be trying to solve the ventilator problem. His idea quickly made its way to the lab’s senior management. “I do space missions,” Roger Gibbs, the deputy director of the engineering and science directorate at J.P.L., told me. “I build things and we send them to other planets.” By Monday, J.P.L. had also decided to build a ventilator. At first, the engineers began in the spirit of Apollo 13. “The spark of this idea was ‘Gee, can we at J.P.L. design a ventilator that uses parts scrounged from a garage, or from a vacuum cleaner, or a Home Depot?’ ” Gibbs said. “That idea lasted about six hours.” They next considered developing a reference design and open-sourcing it for do-it-yourselfers. A doctor who had come in to consult waved them off, explaining that his hospital would only use a device that had been F.D.A.-approved. “He dropped a lot of reality on everybody about the level of engineering we’d have to do,” Michelle Easter, a mechatronics engineer who usually works on actuators for spacecraft, said. The doctor explained what a ventilator was: he told them that, if a patient initiates an inhalation, the ventilator must notice; that ventilated air must be delivered at body temperature; that it should be humidified; that it has to provide high concentrations of oxygen. The engineers, working from first principles, peppered him with questions about pressures, volumes, and rates of change. They decided on a new goal: build the simplest possible easy-to-manufacture ventilator, made from readily supplied parts, that was capable of treating all but the most complex cases of covid-19, and get it approved by the F.D.A. The project unfolded in typical nasa fashion—the gathering of “functional requirements,” the building of increasingly sophisticated prototypes, the holding of team-wide engineering reviews—except over a period of weeks, not years. The team had to adjust to the fact that its design would be produced at volume. “We’re used to having one of the thing, not thousands of the thing,” Easter said. The project had attracted more than a hundred participants, many of whom had never collaborated before. For almost forty days straight, they worked from sunup to sundown—brutal days that were a relief, in their way, from the ennui of lockdown. J.P.L.’s mountain campus, in Pasadena, was mostly empty; on breaks, at picnic tables outside the lab, the engineers watched families of deer graze among wildflowers. J.P.L. worked up two designs in parallel. One is more portable, and uses an air compressor; it’s in the final stages of testing. The other, like the Vermontilator, accepts air from a wall outlet. vital, as the device is known, operates in a unique “volume targeted, pressure limited, time limited” mode, invented at J.P.L. A clinician can set tidal volume, inspiration-expiration ratio, peep, and breaths per minute. Although it doesn’t have a CO2 sensor or a touch screen, it replicates many of the features of more sophisticated, customizable ventilators; a team of artists and illustrators helped design its faceplate. It is expected to cost between one and two thousand dollars, and its approximately three hundred parts have been carefully chosen to avoid siphoning supplies from medical-grade ventilator manufacturers. vital was tested at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York, on a specialized lung simulator, and has received an Emergency Use Authorization from the F.D.A.; J.P.L. has begun looking for manufacturers. In software, “feature creep” is the process by which an initially simple program, through the accretion of enhancements, becomes gargantuan, slow, and hard to use. Microsoft Word can take a long time to load in 2020, even though today’s computers are incredibly powerful. The program’s core functions haven’t changed since 1983, but there are many new ones, and many features add complexity beyond themselves. If you want your program to have both an Equations Editor and Track Changes, then you must teach it to track changes to equations. Even the Undo function is a complex subprogram worthy of several full-time engineers: it must be able to undo not just typos but table reformattings, image resizings, and comments that have been added during a review session. One wouldn’t want to accuse a ventilator of feature creep, since each new feature has the potential to save lives. But a ventilator’s complexity also expands nonlinearly as the number of parts, sensors, and functions grows. The problem is especially acute because medical devices must clear a high set of regulatory hurdles. As devices grow more capable, and more complex and expensive, they require more careful regulation. This dynamic, which is acceptable during peacetime, might seem counterproductive during wartime. And yet the devices must still work, sustaining patients, sometimes for weeks, without glitches or failures. The Vermontilator is as simple a ventilator as could be imagined: the first prototype had seven parts. Even so, most of the team’s time has been spent adding safety valves, pressure regulators, and alarms—safety features required for an F.D.A. Emergency Use Authorization. The M.I.T. E-Vent and the Spiro Wave are more complicated. No one working on the problem envies anyone else’s chosen point along the complexity curve. “That might be O.K. for a very short-term stopgap measure,” Bates said, of the bag-based models. “But you could not have, generally speaking, someone with bad covid lung injury on one of those things for hours or days, because you would destroy the lungs.” In turn, M.I.T. engineers, when hearing about some of the more amateurish bag-based projects, shake their heads. Some respiratory experts insist on the value of top-tier ventilators; a doctor might find the CO2 sensor indispensable, or argue that she’s seen patients’ respiration improve when they’re moved from old, stockpiled ventilators to newer ones. “We’ve been amused at what people have been inventing as solutions,” Sharon Einav, the I.C.U. specialist in Jerusalem, said. “It’s like someone giving you a Fiat Punto when you normally drive a Ferrari. But we’ve not been in a situation where we’ve had to triage patients.” When the Spiro Wave was first imagined, in early March, there were fewer than a thousand confirmed coronavirus cases in New York. By the fourth week of March, there were twenty-six thousand. Ventilators were being sought from innumerable sources: Chinese philanthropists, the governor of Oregon. According to the Times, New York State awarded an eighty-nine-million-dollar contract to Yaron Oren-Pines, a Silicon Valley engineer with no apparent ventilator expertise, who claimed that he could supply the machines; none were delivered. (State representatives said that they were acting on the advice of the federal government.) To insure an adequate supply of ventilators, some hospitals began experimentally upgrading or modifying some of the other breathing devices that they had on hand. In early April, Cohen hosted some I.C.U. doctors at Boyce Technologies, where the Spiro Wave was being manufactured. “These guys were beat to shit,” Cohen said. “They looked at the devices. . . . They were just, like, ‘We need this, guys.’ They just looked us all in the eye. ‘When can we get it?’ ” Cohen’s team said that the ventilators could be ready in four or five days; in the meantime, the engineers would work to polish their design. By the time the Spiro Wave was ready for production, however, cases in New York had begun to decline. The nightmare scenario—doctors triaging patients, providing ventilators to some but not others—never came to pass; on the other hand, many people died outside hospitals, at home or in nursing homes, without ever being put on a ventilator. Officials are still trying to get an accurate count of deaths caused by covid-19. Almost certainly, when such non-hospital deaths are included, the count will jump significantly. There is a difference between holding on and having enough. The climactic language we have adopted during the first phase of the pandemic—waves, surges, peaks—may be misleading. The emergency continues. As locked-down cities open up, the virus will likely infect new people, many living in places without the health-care resources of big cities like New York and Seattle. “When I hear New York talking about the fact that they are down the backside of the mountain, I know they have been through hell,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the University of Minnesota, said last month. “But they have to understand, that’s not the mountain. That is the foothills. They have mountains to go yet. We have a lot of people to get infected before this is over.” G.M. and Ford are still aiming to contribute to the Strategic National Stockpile, a bulwark against second waves in major cities and a surge in rural cases. Spiro Wave is turning its attention to global distribution; Cohen and his team have been talking with leading health-care professionals in Ethiopia. “Those in the Southern Hemisphere are only just starting to feel it,” he said. In Vermont, hospitals have avoided becoming overwhelmed, and the curve has flattened. But Bates and his team, who anticipate receiving F.D.A. approval soon, are negotiating with the state for a purchase order. The team is contemplating a “Mark II” Vermontilator, which would still deliver A.P.R.V. but with more customizable settings. Bates recently received an e-mail from someone who works with the World Bank in the Central African Republic—a country of more than five million people, with only three ventilators. “That opens up a whole new potential for us,” he said. (In addition to ventilators, of course, the country would need clinicians with the training to operate them.) Whatever the result, he continued, the Vermontilator project has enabled him “to work with people at a level of intensity that would never have been possible without this crisis. And so you find out just what is possible.” The missions have launched, destinations uncertain. No one can say for sure where or when the ventilators will be needed; no one knows which design is best or more cost-effective or reliable. Researchers are still trying to figure out how the virus does its damage. “If you don’t understand the illness,” Einav said, “even the most sophisticated ventilator is not going to work.” Doctors treating covid-19 are exploring ways to avoid intubating patients for as long as possible, using different equipment and techniques to support failing lungs. The month of March—when the official case count began skyrocketing in New York, and when ventilator projects at the University of Vermont, M.I.T., New Lab, Ford, G.M., and nasa began—already seems like the distant past. But building quickly, in advance of a murky future, may be what we need to do in a pandemic. On Friday, March 13th—the same day Bates got the text message about A.P.R.V.—Michael Ryan, the executive director of health emergencies at the World Health Organization, described the most important lesson he’d learned while fighting outbreaks of Ebola. “Be fast. Have no regrets,” he said. “If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated the material used to make the casing of the Spiro Wave.

Reality Has Endorsed Bernie Sanders,17169,"The debate over the role of government in addressing income inequality, housing insecurity, debt accumulation, and health care continues, now against the grim backdrop of the raging coronavirus. It is difficult to articulate the speed with which the U.S. and, indeed, the world, has descended into an existential crisis. We are experiencing an unprecedented public-health event whose diminution and potential resolution rests with a series of prescriptions, including settlement-in-place orders, that will annihilate the economy. The deadly spread of covid-19 demands enclosure as a way to starve the searching virus of bodies to inhabit. The consequences of doing so removes workers from work and consumers from consumption; no economy can operate under these conditions. American life has been suddenly and dramatically upended, and, when things are turned upside down, the bottom is brought to the surface and exposed to the light. In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath ravaged the Gulf Coast, it, too, provided a deeper look into the darkness of U.S. inequality. As the actor Danny Glover said then, “When the hurricane struck the Gulf and the floodwaters rose and tore through New Orleans, plunging its remaining population into a carnival of misery, it did not turn the region into a Third World country, as it has been disparagingly implied in the media; it revealed one. It revealed the disaster within the disaster; gruelling poverty rose to the surface like a bruise to our skin.” For years, the United States has gotten away with persistently chipping away at its weak welfare state by hiding or demonizing the populations most dependent on it. The poor are relegated as socially dysfunctional and inept, unable to cash in on the riches of American society. There are more than forty million poor people in the U.S., but they almost never merit a mention. While black poverty is presented as exemplary, white poverty is obscured, and Latinos and other brown people’s experiences are ignored. As many as four in five Americans say they live paycheck to paycheck. Forty per cent of Americans say that they cannot cover an unexpected four-hundred-dollar emergency expense. This is a virus that will thrive in the intimacy of American poverty. For years now, even in the midst of the economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, rising rents and stagnant salaries and wages have forced millions of families to improvise housing; nearly four million households live in overcrowded homes. This is the cruel irony of the San Francisco Bay Area’s shelter-in-place mandate: the region is at the epicenter of the U.S. housing crisis, as exemplified by its growing unsheltered homeless population. How do you practice social isolation without privacy or personal space? There are the crowded public offices that poor people congregate in to navigate access to services and income. There are the emergency rooms that function as primary health-care providers—not to mention the county jails and state prisons. Economic inequality is exacerbated by racial injustice, both held in place by a threadbare social-safety net. Black and brown populations are particularly vulnerable to infection because poverty is a fount of underlying conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary disease, and heart disease, that make it more likely that the virus will be deadly. They are also more vulnerable because greater rates of poverty and under-employment have hindered access to health care. In Milwaukee, the most segregated city in the U.S., where black unemployment is four times the rate of white unemployment, the majority of diagnosed coronavirus cases are middle-aged black men. And as anyone who has ever had to wonder how they will make their rent payment knows, the stress of economic uncertainty is corrosive, eating into the capability of the immune system. But the danger of contracting the coronavirus will hardly be the problem of the poor and working class alone. Those who, because of poverty and insecurity, are most vulnerable to infection also have disproportionate contact with the broader public, through their low-wage retail and service work. Consider the plight of the home health-care worker. Millions of such workers attend to a largely elderly and homebound population for meagre hourly wages and often without health insurance. In 2018, home health-care workers, eighty-seven per cent of whom are women and sixty per cent of whom are black or Latino, made an average of about eleven dollars and fifty cents an hour. These workers are the sinews of our society: they must work to insure that our society continues to function, even as that work poses potential threats to their clients and the general public. Their insecurity, combined with the failure of meaningful action by the federal government, will make the suppression of the virus nearly impossible. Thus far, the Trump Administration has predictably bungled the response to the coronavirus. But the Democratic Party’s response has been hampered by its shared hostility to unleashing the power of the state, through the advance of vast universal programs, to attend to an unprecedented, devolving catastrophe. About half of American workers receive health insurance through their employer. As job losses mount, millions of workers will lose their insurance while the public-health crisis surges. In the last Democratic debate, former Vice-President Joe Biden insisted that the U.S. doesn’t need single-payer health care because the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy proved that it doesn’t work. Strangely, he simultaneously insisted that all testing and treatment of the virus should be free because we are in crisis. This insistence that health care should only be free in an emergency reveals a profound ignorance about the ways that preventive medicine can mitigate the harshest effects of an acute infection. By mid-February, a Chinese government study of that country’s coronavirus-related deaths found that those with preëxisting conditions accounted for at least a third of all covid-19 fatalities. Dismissing the necessity of universal health care also shows an obliviousness to the power of medical expenses to alter the course of one’s life. Two-thirds of Americans who file for bankruptcy say that medical debt or losing work while they were sick contributed to their need to do so. The costs of medical treatment become a reason for postponing visits to the doctor. A 2018 poll found that forty-four per cent of Americans delayed seeing a doctor due to its cost. Already, half of Americans polled have said that they worry about the costs of the testing and treatment of covid-19. In a situation like the one we are in, it becomes easy to see the ways that encumbered access to health care exacerbates a public-health breakdown. N.B.A. players, celebrities, and the wealthy have access to the coronavirus test, but attending nurses and frontline health-care workers, community health centers, and public hospitals do not. Health-care inequalities are problems that have been left unattended, creating so many small, imperceptible fractures that, in the midst of a full-scale crisis, the structure is collapsing, shattering under its own weight. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media The case has never been clearer for a transition to Medicare for All, but its achievement clashes with the Democratic Party’s decades-long hostility to funding the social-welfare state. At the heart of this resistance is the pernicious glorification of “personal responsibility,” through which success or failure in life is seen as an expression of personal fortitude or personal laxity. The American Dream, we are told, is anchored in the promise of unfettered social mobility, a destiny driven by self-determination and perseverance. This ingrained thinking evades the fact that it was the New Deal, in the nineteen-thirties, and the G.I. Bill, in the nineteen-forties, that, through a combination of federal work programs, subsidies, and government-backed guarantees, created a middle-class life style for millions of white Americans. In the nineteen-sixties, as a result of prolonged black protest, Lyndon Johnson authored the War on Poverty and other Great Society programs, which were intended to lessen the impact of decades of racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and education. By 1969, with Richard Nixon at the helm, during an economic downturn that ended what was then the longest economic expansion in American history, the conservatives attacked the notion of the “social contract” embedded in all of these programs, claiming that they rewarded laziness and were evidence of special rights for some. When Nixon ran for reëlection, in 1972, he claimed that his campaign pitted the “work ethic” against the “welfare ethic.” This was an attack not only on public aid and subsidized housing but also on the people using those programs. Republicans successfully tapped into the racial resentments of white suburbanites, who decried “their” tax dollars going to unruly, rioting African-Americans. They resented “forced integration,” “forced busing,” and “the bureaucrats,” as Nixon derisively called the previous Democratic Administrations. It is important to understand that this was not demonization for its own sake or because of some irrational antipathy toward African-Americans. This was about keeping the corporate tax rate low and reëstablishing the profitability of capital in the aftermath of another, longer economic downturn. It is hard for businesses and their political representatives to counsel ordinary workers to do more with less. It was easier to blame welfare queens, welfare cheats, and an oblique, yet black, underclass for the end of these “wasteful” programs. In 1973, Nixon unceremoniously declared an end to the “urban crisis”—the catalyst for much of Johnson’s welfare state. This created the pretext for his gutting of the Office of Economic Opportunity, the office that managed the web of anti-poverty programs created by the War on Poverty. The eventual defection of ordinary white voters from the Democratic Party to the Republicans meant that the Democrats soon aped the right’s strategy of downplaying the structural roots of inequality while portraying black communities as ultimately responsible for their own hardships. By the end of the nineteen-eighties, the Democratic Party was championing law-and-order politics and harsh, racist attacks on welfare entitlements. In a 1988 column for the Post of Newark, Delaware, titled “Welfare System About to Change,” the then Senator Biden wrote, “We are all too familiar with the stories of welfare mothers driving luxury cars and leading lifestyles that mirror the rich and famous. Whether they are exaggerated or not, these stories underlie a broad social concern that the welfare system has broken down—that it only parcels out welfare checks and does nothing to help the poor find productive jobs.” This statement was hardly extraordinary; it reflected widespread efforts to transform public perceptions of the Democratic Party. By the early nineties, President Bill Clinton was promising to “end welfare as we know it,” which he succeeded in doing by the end of the decade. This is the historical backdrop to the hypocrisy of U.S. government-spending priorities today. Bipartisan denunciations of big government do not apply to the obscene amounts spent on the military or the maintenance of the nation’s criminal-justice system. The U.S., across all levels of government, spends more than eighty billion dollars annually to operate jails and prisons and to maintain probation and parole. The budget for the U.S. armed forces topped out at a stunning seven hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars for this year alone—more than the next seven largest military budgets in the world. Meanwhile, social-welfare programs—from food stamps to Medicaid, to subsidized and assisted housing, to public schools—are forced to provide on the thinnest margin, triaging crises, rather than actually pulling people out of poverty. When Bernie Sanders’s critics mocked his platform as just a bunch of “free stuff,” they were drawing on the past forty years of bipartisan consensus about social-welfare benefits and entitlements. They have argued, instead, that competition organized through the market insures more choices and better quality. In fact, the surreality of market logic was on clear display when, on March 13th, Donald Trump held a press conference to discuss the covid-19 crisis with executives from Walgreens, Target, Walmart, and CVS, and a host of laboratory, research, and medical-device corporations. There were no social-service providers or educators there to discuss the immediate, overwhelming needs of the public. The crisis is laying bare the brutality of an economy organized around production for the sake of profit and not human need. The logic that the free market knows best can be seen in the prioritization of affordability in health care as millions careen toward economic ruin. It is seen in the ways that states have been thrown into frantic competition with one another for personal protective equipment and ventilators—the equipment goes to whichever state can pay the most. It can be seen in the still criminally slow and inefficient and inconsistent testing for the virus. It is found in the multi-billion-dollar bailout of the airline industry, alongside nickel-and-dime means tests to determine which people might be eligible to receive ridiculously inadequate public assistance. The argument for resuming a viable social-welfare state is about not only attending to the immediate needs of tens of millions of people but also reëstablishing social connectivity, collective responsibility, and a sense of common purpose, if not common wealth. In an unrelenting and unemotional way, covid-19 is demonstrating the vastness of our human connection and mutuality. Our collectivity must be borne out in public policies that repair the friable welfare infrastructure that threatens to collapse beneath our social weight. A society that allows hundreds of thousands of home health-care workers to labor without health insurance, that keeps school buildings open so that black and brown children can eat and be sheltered, that allows millionaires to stow their wealth in empty apartments while homeless families navigate the streets, that threatens eviction and loan defaults while hundreds of millions are mandated to stay inside to suppress the virus, is bewildering in its incoherence and inhumanity. Naomi Klein has written about how the political class has used social catastrophes to create policies that allow for private plunder. She calls it “disaster capitalism,” or the “shock doctrine.” But she has also written that, in each of these moments, there are also opportunities for ordinary people to transform their conditions in ways that benefit humanity. The class-driven hierarchy of our society will encourage the spread of this virus unless dramatic and previously unthinkable solutions are immediately put on the table. As Sanders has counselled, we must think in unprecedented ways. This includes universal health care, an indefinite moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, the cancellation of student-loan debt, a universal basic income, and the reversal of all cuts to food stamps. These are the basic measures that can staunch the immediate crisis of deprivation—of millions of layoffs and millions more to come. The Sanders campaign was an entry point to this discussion. It has shown public appetite, even desire, for vast spending and new programs. These desires did not translate into votes because they seemed like a risky endeavor when the consequence was four more years of Trump. But the mushrooming crisis of covid-19 is changing the calculus. As federal officials announce new trillion-dollar aid packages daily, we can never go back to banal discussions of “How will we pay for it?” How can we not?

The Coming Coronavirus Critical-Care Emergency,18578,"When the coronavirus outbreak first began, in December, in Wuhan, China, Ruoran Li, a doctoral student in epidemiology at Harvard, paid particular attention. Li’s research has focussed on tuberculosis, but she is originally from Shenzhen, a city of more than thirteen million people on the southern shore of mainland China, bordering Hong Kong. She gave an online seminar on the epidemiology of the outbreak in February, arranged by a Harvard student organization, and began to closely follow the social-media accounts of people in Wuhan. Li noticed that the stories of suffering she saw often had a particular pattern. There were reports of people trying to get emergency care, or a bed at the hospital, and, in one case, she said, dying before doctors could reach their car. Other reports indicated that patients needing dialysis were being turned away and were dying at home. The issue seemed to be capacity: the hospitals in Wuhan simply did not have enough beds or doctors (or enough of the right kinds of beds or doctors) to treat all of the sick. One day, Li was watching the live WeChat feed of a wealthy, anonymous man in Wuhan who was giving his followers advice on how to access a hospital in the middle of the outbreak, in case they had relatives who needed care. “In China, usually if you have some connections—you know someone at the hospital, or you know a doctor—there wouldn’t be trouble getting in,” Li said. “It was a shock to me, because even those who have a very high social status couldn’t get in. It was just maxed out.” The possibility that this pandemic might max out the hospitals—that there is a hard limit to the number of patients that they can treat at once, and that the number of covid-19 patients will exceed it—is the preoccupation of everyone working in medicine in the United States. It is the nightmare scenario, and it has led to a shutdown of public life across the country, as a last-ditch effort to “flatten the curve”—to slow the rate at which people contract the virus, in order to slow the rate at which patients are admitted to hospitals. Since the virus first appeared in the U.S., public-health officials have issued warnings about possible shortages of basic medical supplies, including masks and gloves to protect health-care workers from the virus—in large part because much of that equipment is manufactured in China. (This week, BuzzFeed News reported that Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City, one of the preëminent treatment centers in the country, has only a week’s supply of masks left. Three patients and at least five staff members have been diagnosed with covid-19, though not all of them were infected at the hospital.) On Tuesday, the New York Times and ProPublica both published an analysis of hospital beds from the Harvard Global Health Institute; per the Times, the data found that, in a “moderate” scenario, hospitals in forty per cent of American hospital markets “would not be able to make enough room for all the patients who became ill with Covid-19, even if they could empty their beds of other patients.” But, as an increasing number of Americans have become critically ill with the virus, public-health experts have raised alarms about what may be the hardest limit on hospitals’ ability to care for such patients: the availability of ventilators, the assisted-breathing devices that are the main tools of intervention in intensive-care units. Some patients who develop pneumonia as a result of covid-19 need ventilators to breathe for them when they can no longer do so on their own; the assistance gives their immune systems time to develop antibodies and fight off the virus. Run out of ventilators and those patients run out of time. Li found that the Chinese government had created an online database of cases in both Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei Province. She began to plot that data, day by day, so that she could determine how many infected people became sick enough to require hospitalization and how many became so sick that they needed ventilators. During the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, in mid- to late February, Li calculated that two thousand and eighty-seven covid-19 patients required intensive care every day, usually including ventilator support. That meant that Wuhan’s medical-care centers needed about 2.6 intensive-care beds for every ten thousand adults in the city. Li took her results to one of her advisers, Marc Lipsitch, who put her in touch with other epidemiologists, among them Eric Toner, at Johns Hopkins, who specializes in studying hospital capacity. Together, in a paper released on March 10th, Li, Toner, and four co-authors, all from Harvard and Hopkins, worked to apply the rates of bed need in intensive-care units from Wuhan to major American cities. According to a 2010 report that they cite, there are 2.8 critical-care hospital beds for every ten thousand American adults, and a separate study, from 2015, suggests that those beds generally have a sixty-five-per-cent occupancy rate. That means a Wuhan-like event in the U.S. would stretch, and perhaps overwhelm, many American I.C.U.s. As they worked through the details, they found good reason to think that the American outbreak could be worse than Wuhan’s. Fourteen per cent of Wuhan’s population is over the age of sixty-five, compared with fifteen per cent in the United States, and the rates of crucial comorbidities, such as hypertension, are higher in the U.S. Li and her colleagues calculated that, in an American city, the outbreak could require 2.6 I.C.U. beds for every ten thousand adults, as it did in Wuhan, but when I spoke to her last Friday she told me that now they believe that figure represents a better-case scenario. The upper bound, they calculated, would be 4.9 critically ill people per every ten thousand. In the paper, Li and her co-authors wrote, “If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to take place in a US city, even with strong social distancing and contact tracing protocols as strict as the Wuhan lockdown, hospitalization and ICU needs from COVID-19 patients alone may exceed current capacity.” The Chinese government placed Wuhan on lockdown on January 23rd and rapidly built two new hospitals in the city; one began operating on February 3rd, the other less than a week later. The outbreak in China was still largely concentrated in Wuhan, which gave medical authorities more options. Qi Tan, one of Li’s co-authors, is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and, until two years ago, was a pulmonologist working at a hospital in Nanjing, a city of eight million not far from Shanghai. She told me, “There are thirty or more doctors in the I.C.U. at my home hospital, and ventilators, and in early February all of it”—including the doctors—“went to Wuhan, to Hubei Province.” Chinese officials have said that ten per cent of the country’s critical-care capacity was sent to Wuhan to fight the outbreak. In the United States, the outbreak is already diffuse, which makes any similar reallocation unlikely. (Ventilators will probably not be sent from Boston to New York, because they are needed in Boston.) John Hick, the medical director for emergency preparedness at Hennepin Healthcare, in Minnesota, has been studying how ventilator capacity might be increased during a pandemic since 2002, when he participated in a disaster-planning exercise that simulated a “very bad disease” outbreak in Minneapolis. “We realized very quickly that there is just a really hard stop on the number of ventilators we have in a city,” Hick said. “There just isn’t a lot of slack in the system.” As the crisis has escalated, Eric Toner has tried to work out how many more breathing machines are available nationally. There is a federal stockpile of ventilators, for use in emergencies, which Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has put at twelve thousand and seven hundred. When President Donald Trump told a group of governors, on a conference call on Monday, “Respirators, ventilators, all the equipment—try getting it yourselves,” he was presumably holding this stockpile in reserve. Anesthesia machines, normally used in surgeries, can provide some similar functions to ventilators, though using one for a patient with pneumonia would mean that it could not be used for a surgery. Transport ventilators often used in ambulances could, in theory, be repurposed to be useful for some less severe I.C.U. patients. “A very ballpark number: maybe you could get up to a hundred and fifty thousand ventilators,” Toner told me on Monday. “That would mean cancelling almost all surgeries and all procedures, and taking very dramatic and drastic steps that would create a great deal of difficulty. I think that is the absolute limit, and I’m not sure we could get to that number.” Toner, Li, and their co-authors had estimated that, in cities with major covid-19 outbreaks, between 2.1 and 4.9 ventilators would be needed per every ten thousand people. I asked Toner what those numbers would mean for American cities. “Those cities and hospitals that are on the low end of that spectrum, they will be extraordinarily stressed, like they’ve never been stressed before,” Toner said. “On the upper end, that would be something like they’ve never imagined before, where, no matter what we do, we don’t have enough mechanical ventilators for everyone who needs them, and we will need to make allocation decisions—rationing decisions.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media So far, the pressure of this outbreak has been on public-health systems and administrators to “dig under the couch cushions,” as Hick put it, to try to increase their capacity as best they can. But some doctors are also beginning to think about what might happen if there is not enough capacity. In Italy, as pressures stemming from the coronavirus rose, guidance published by that country’s national association of critical-care doctors suggested that, if rationing was needed, ventilators should be reserved for patients with “the greatest life expectancy.” The practical problems—finding more breathing machines—lead directly to ethical ones about what to do if there are not enough ventilators and care has to be rationed, with some patients chosen over others. Those decisions would belong not to the system, in some general way, but to doctors, and in particular the pulmonologists running the I.C.U.s. My wife, Heather Parsons, is an oncologist who works at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, on the western edge of Boston. Several other large hospitals (Brigham and Women’s, Beth Israel Deaconess, Boston Children’s) are situated within a few blocks, as is Harvard Medical School, with which all of these institutions are affiliated. We live about fifteen blocks away from the medical campus, in the Coolidge Corner neighborhood of Brookline, in what must be one of the world’s densest concentrations of doctors and medical scientists, talent drawn from all over the planet. They are impressive people, and they are perhaps especially impressive to one another—no one wants to be the weak link. In my experience, doctors think about their patients but also about their fellow-doctors and nurses and medical staff—about the vast, collaborative, intricately organized enterprise of professionals of which they are part. “Everyone tries so hard,” Heather told me once, when she was in medical school and starting to work in hospitals, and she has said it hundreds of times in the years since. Everyone is always trying so hard. This past week, everyone has been trying even harder. Each time I dropped our son off at the medical-faculty day care, it was awash in weighty new rumors. Certain surgeries, less acute ones, were said to be postponed. Some doctors were said to be quarantined at home for fourteen days, uneasy and anxious at being sidelined. Only the Massachusetts State Public Health Lab was certified to test for covid-19, which made it all but impossible to have a suspected case confirmed. Doctors were having to make decisions about what precautions to take without knowing for sure who had the virus. Even the mundane workings of the hospital, such as the waiting rooms and elevators, carried new risks, and so decisions that had been easy—say, about whether to have a patient in for a follow-up—became hard. Many of Heather’s patients, people with breast cancer, are on immunosuppressive drugs, and are particularly vulnerable. These decisions had little to do with the limits on ventilator capacity, but they shared the same sharpening realization of trade-offs. A friend of mine suggested that I meet a colleague of his, Emmy Rubin, an attending intensive-care pulmonologist at Massachusetts General and the co-chair of the hospital’s Optimum Care Committee, which she described as the “ethics committee.” We arranged to meet on Friday afternoon, in a pub across the street from Mass General, and though I showed up fifteen minutes early she was already there—a small woman in a green raincoat, with short brown hair, Tina Fey glasses, and an intense and worried look—with the punctuality I’ve come to expect from doctors. Rubin has been involved in planning for the response to the outbreak. When I met her, she was also preparing for a scheduled two-week rotation running one of Mass General’s medical I.C.U.s, beginning on Wednesday, and was trying to weigh what she would do if the I.C.U.s became overwhelmed. Rubin told me that, in some personal ways, she was “totally unprepared.” She said, “Should I be, like, writing letters to everyone I care about? I mean, I guess it can’t hurt, but on the other hand am I realistically going to do that, like, this weekend?” In the Mass General I.C.U.s—the best-resourced units in one of the very best-resourced hospitals in the best-resourced country in the history of the world—the general American assumption of infinite possibility reaches something like an apogee. “Our culture here in the United States is that people who want critical care generally receive it,” Rubin said. “So the idea of not being able to offer it, or saying there are certain people we cannot offer it to, is very new, and a huge departure.” As the stories of strict age limits that were being recommended for ventilator allocation in Italy spread, Rubin had been thinking through the ways in which various ethical frameworks might be applied to rationing care. A strict age cutoff had the advantage of taking all subjectivity out of a doctor’s decision, she said, but it also seemed a little hard to defend, because not all people are equally healthy or equally likely to live a long life. She also raised the idea that some people, based on their professions, might receive preferential treatment, such as “health-care workers or other people who could help save lives or provide a valuable social good that contributes to solving these problems in the future.” In the abstract, it is easy enough to say that a healthier patient with longer to live ought to be prioritized over a sick one. But when a doctor is confronted with two charts of people whom she has never met, it is not easy to quickly make a call. Within the community of medical ethicists, Rubin said, there had been some efforts to define categories of patients—those with malignant metastatic cancer, for instance—who might receive lower priority. But even that seemed too crude: with modern therapies, Rubin pointed out, you could have patients with metastatic breast cancer who would live for fifteen years. “As you try to come up with categories, you really recognize the limitations of those categories and the difficulty of lumping people together who are not all the same,” she said. “Anything but a strict cutoff is going to be extremely subjective.” But extremely subjective measures are still, she said, “probably the best tool.” Eventually, Rubin had to go, and as I lingered, taking notes, I realized that the pub, empty when our conversation started, was now starting to fill up. Schools were being cancelled, and the governor of Massachusetts had just issued an order limiting gatherings to two hundred and fifty people. Beer was being poured, the mugs passed from hand to hand to mouth; plates were being cleared; the men’s room, bar-grimy, was being used, and then people were returning to the bar and eating again. I saw no one with a mask or gloves; surely the disease was spreading. Before Rubin left, we’d chatted for a bit about her plans for the weekend, which had once been to go to Cape Cod and were now to make sure that the ethical plans for the I.C.U. were updated to account for covid-19. We talked about how Rubin’s I.C.U. rotation might be different than it had been in the past; she mentioned that, because of the risk of contagion, family members would not be allowed to visit infected patients (except, perhaps, in end-of-life scenarios), though technology was being set up to allow for video conferencing. Part of the emotional work of an I.C.U. doctor is to build a quick rapport with a patient’s family, so that life-and-death decisions are understood as joint ones and not as the imposed preferences of the doctors. “It is very hard to build that rapport when you are not in the room with them,” Rubin said. Imagining the scene seemed to clarify what she hoped to avoid. “The horror story is that they are dying alone.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

How Doctors on the Front Lines Are Confronting the Uncertainties of COVID-19,24332,"For Hooman Kamel, an intensivist at a Manhattan hospital, the weekend just before he started seeing covid-19 patients in his I.C.U. was the darkest time. Kamel is a witty, blunt-talking doctor who grew up in San Jose and came to medicine by way of Harvard, Columbia, and U.C.S.F. In his ordinary professional life, he is a research physician, and spends most of his time studying the causes and treatment of strokes. In early February, when there were still fewer than a hundred confirmed covid-19 cases in the United States, Kamel watched the spread of the epidemic with interest but no particular urgency. Toward the middle of that month, he told me recently, his sense of personal alarm began to kick in, not because of any change in external circumstances but because his wife was due, in a few weeks, to give birth to their second child. “There’s this sort of heightened anxiety in general when you’re expecting a kid,” he said. “So a lot of my initial interest was as a doctor in general but also personally thinking, Should we be stocking up on Purell, formula, all this stuff?” In the weeks after the baby, a boy, was born, Kamel’s anxiety ticked up another couple of notches. Kamel, a self-professed Twitter addict, had been following reports from physicians working in and around Seattle, where the outbreak was intensifying. In mid-March, he came across a Twitter thread that supposedly reproduced notes written by a critical-care doctor working on the front lines. The notes were written in an opaque medical shorthand, and they described a hospital that was desperately short of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) and overrun with critically ill covid-19 patients, some of whom were in their twenties and had no underlying medical conditions. “As much as you try to be rational and scientific-minded, I think the brain has a funny way of dismissing things that aren’t directly related to you,” Kamel told me. “So, even given the early reports out of China, and then the stuff out of Italy, there’s this element of, like, O.K., it’s gonna be different here, without being able to specify why it was any different.” But the notes from Seattle were a wake-up call. Within a week, he said, “I was just a complete wreck. I was looking at my son, and thinking, like, How is he going to handle life as an orphan?” On March 21st, in the midst of his gloom, Kamel got an e-mail from someone he knew from his medical residency, a primary-care physician who works on an Indian reservation in Minnesota. The primary-care physician had seen an article in the Times about quarantine parties taking place entirely online, and he invited—begged, really—other members of their residency class to meet up with him in a Zoom video-conference call. The virtual cocktail party happened that Saturday night, and the conversation turned so quickly to covid-19 that Kamel’s baby boy barely rated a mention. Instead, the group of friends talked about how best to manage a disease that five months ago had never been seen in a human being. So far, most of the world’s attention has been justifiably dedicated to stopping the transmission of the disease, whether by quarantines and social distancing or vaccines. But the doctors on the call needed answers to a different question: what to do when covid-19 showed up at their hospital doors. They needed to know whether it was unusual for patients to get better before they got worse, for instance (no, it seems to happen with some frequency), or whether hydroxychloroquine would exacerbate poor cardiac outcomes (possible, but not likely). In ordinary times, these were the kinds of questions that would get sorted out by randomized trials and meta-analyses, but that kind of science took time that they didn’t have. The lack of P.P.E. was another concern. Many of the doctors on the call had previously practiced abroad, in places like Bolivia, Uganda, and Haiti, and they’d been in situations where it was not a given that they’d be able to protect themselves against whatever contagions they were treating. Nevertheless, the notion that it might be up to them to secure functional P.P.E. for themselves and their colleagues at hospitals in the United States was a shocking novelty. The Minnesota primary-care physician told his friends that he’d scoured the shelves of his local hardware stores for construction-grade N95 masks and was ready to send bundles to anyone who needed them. A cardiologist who also lived in Minnesota said that she’d been writing letters to her governor about the critical need for more P.P.E. The urgency of the conversation about P.P.E. stemmed in large part from the same fear that Kamel had been experiencing. Although there is much about covid-19 that is frightening for everyone—the speed of transmission, the scale of the spread, the medical and economic devastation left in its wake—for health-care workers and others on the front lines of the outbreak, there is a special concern. Without adequate P.P.E., they are at serious risk of contracting the disease themselves. And, since many of the doctors on the call were married, with young children, whatever risks they bore themselves would all but certainly be shared with their families. Kamel’s wife, who was listening in on the call from the other end of the couch, was, he said, “utterly terrified after our conversation.” However, Kamel told me that seeing the faces of his residency friends, with whom he’d shared some of his most difficult days during his training as a physician, was a “huge existential lift.” “It was very reassuring to feel like I wasn’t going into this alone. We’d done something very difficult in the past, and we can deal with this.” Kamel and other physicians on the front lines of the pandemic are now operating in an atmosphere of pervasive uncertainty. Though more and more is being learned every day, there is still a tremendous amount of information, some of it very basic, that we simply do not yet have about covid-19. Information about how a disease spreads among populations, how it progresses in the bodies of patients, and how its clinical course might be shortened or ameliorated is usually considered crucial for doctors trying to figure out how best to care for their patients. For covid-19, however, all of this is still being sorted out. Compounding these difficulties is a strong sense among many of the physicians I’ve spoken to that the federal government, and particularly the Centers for Disease Control, has not supplied the sort of clinical leadership that the moment demands. To fill that vacuum, doctors have been able to look to high-impact medical journals and academic institutions, such as the University of Washington, in Seattle, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston. But, much like Kamel, they’ve also relied on more informal networks to get the information and the support they need. Prashant Bhave, a cardiologist in North Carolina, told me that on-the-ground reports he’d heard from friends and former colleagues had given him a useful counterbalance to some of what he’d been seeing and hearing elsewhere. “If you’d watched the Coronavirus Task Force, or the news, you might have gotten a sense that there was a mask shortage,” he said. “But you wouldn’t necessarily understand that there were emergency-department residents using the same mask for a week at a time. I got that through other communities of people who are actually doing the work.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist In addition to talking to friends and colleagues, Bhave had recently watched a live stream of grand rounds at U.C.S.F., in which doctors discussed the symptoms and treatment of covid-19. In his own hospital, he said, “We’re trying to figure out, does every patient with covid need an echocardiogram? What blood tests are you going to send? Are those going to be things that you’re going to do on every patient? There’s not consensus on that, and so listening to grand rounds from U.C.S.F., where I really respect the people, is super valuable.” For obvious reasons, many of the earliest findings from American physicians emerged out of the Seattle area, where the country’s outbreak first took hold. In mid-March, around the time that Kamel read the anonymous clinical notes online, Elizabeth Kaplan, a hospitalist at the University of Washington, learned that her responsibilities would soon include handling an influx of covid-19 patients. One of her new tasks was to admit and triage so-called rule-outs, patients who were waiting on tests to determine if they had the disease. “I wasn’t yet doing any clinical care, but I was realizing my job was going to be changed,” she said. Kaplan is a very accomplished physician, but she told me that one of her deepest fears has always been that she might harm a patient because of something she didn’t know. In her usual hospital work, there were always experts and published guidelines that could fill in any gaps she might have in her training or education. But, with covid-19, “the people around me were scared, and were learning at the same time. That unknown—that I was going to let patients down by not being able to offer them anything—was scary.” On Thursday, March 12th, Kaplan posted a brief note on Facebook. She’d gone to work that morning in an old black fleece that she used to wear during residency, and said in the note that she “wanted to pass on huge gratitude to the healthcare workers who I trained with or who trained me.” Kaplan told me later that the current situation had “brought back the fear I used to have going into a call in residency, when I was worried I was inadequate.” The post, she said, drew many responses, both online and off, including from doctors around the country who had clinical questions. “They asked me, ‘What are you doing about P.P.E.? What treatments are you using? What are the clinical presentations you’re seeing?’ ” Kaplan was able to point them to a Web site maintained by the University of Washington that offered regularly updated guidance for physicians on the front lines. The exchanges, she said, “gave me this incredible sense of camaraderie, and also a reminder that I had been trained well to function in uncertainty.” In early February, Rebecca Cogswell, the cardiologist in Minnesota who had been writing letters to her governor, had a nightmare in which she and her colleagues were wearing hazmat suits and deciding which of their patients to put on ventilators. “I was super doomsday from the beginning,” she told me. “I just looked at my husband, and I said, ‘There’s no way this is going to be contained.’ ” To prepare for the arrival of covid-19, she kept up with what was being published in the major medical journals and watched a Webinar with Chinese cardiologists that had been organized by a professional organization. But she also relied on an informal group of cardiologists around the country who traded video messages on an app called Marco Polo. “One of my colleagues will be in the I.C.U. and say, ‘O.K., the numbers in Detroit are such and such. This is how many rule-outs we have. We also just saw this case where we had fluid collection around the heart that we had to drain.’ ” Charles Everett, a critical-care pulmonologist in the Bay Area, told me he’d also been keeping an eye on the outbreak throughout February and into early March, and had even built his own epidemiological model to estimate how many patients his hospital might see. But, unlike Cogswell, he’d initially believed the officials, in the federal government and elsewhere, who’d said that the outbreak was still relatively contained in the U.S. It took a number of alarming reports out of Washington and Italy to change his mind. The notes from the anonymous physician in Seattle made a particularly strong impression. Though he had no idea who wrote them—and still doesn’t—he says it was clear to him that “this was a clinically savvy person. This was doctor talk, one hundred per cent.” Everett told me that the C.D.C., at that point, “was a dead zone” for clinical information, and the notes helped him understand what to expect. Everett quit Twitter several years ago—“I profess to hate it, which I mostly do, but I hate it because I loved it so much”—but he quickly realized that it was one of the few places to get the information he might need. “It was not happening in C.D.C. briefings every day, the way I feel like it should have been,” he told me. “I was, like, There’s nobody who’s got any formal, official sources of information here. We’re in a void. All the information is in places where I don’t go and I don’t know how to access. And we need somebody tasked with that. So I literally said, ‘Who’s got a Twitter account?’ ” Only one of the members of his physician’s group did. “I was, like, ‘Sorry, you’re it. You’ve got to be on Twitter.’ ” This is probably the place to mention that I know all of these doctors—Kamel, Bhave, Cogswell, Everett, and Kaplan—through my wife, Jess, who is an infectious-disease doctor at suny Downstate, in central Brooklyn. For much of the past two months, she has watched with significant trepidation as the number of cases in New York grew from a trickle to a stream to an overwhelming flood tide. Most of her patients have significant health problems, and many are poor. Jess has been deeply worried about them—not only because covid-19 outcomes are worse for people with so-called co-morbidities but also because the recent lockdowns, as necessary as they have become, pose dire risks to people who were already living economically and medically precarious lives. On Wednesday, a patient called and said that her home-health aide had died of a suspected case of covid-19; who could safely help her, the patient wanted to know, while she was under quarantine? Worrying about her patients is not a new experience for Jess. But what has made the outbreak qualitatively different from her normal practice was the thought that she might, despite every precaution, bring the disease home to me and our two kids. At some level, this was, of course, a reasonable concern. In my own experience, there’s an element of black comedy in performing the rituals of extreme social distancing while seeing your spouse off to the hospital each morning. Nevertheless, the risk to either of us suffering a bad outcome from covid-19 was very low, and the risk to our kids was even lower. And, data aside, whatever chance there was of something serious happening seemed more than a fair trade for getting to watch my wife practice her indispensable trade. Jess is the daughter and granddaughter of physicians—on our kitchen bulletin board hangs a copy of a letter that Albert Sabin sent her grandfather along with a batch of polio vaccine—and being a doctor is something she loves, and something I love her for loving. In recent weeks, Jess’s worry has taken the form of an anxious anticipation. When people ask how she’s been feeling, as they often do these days, she sometimes responds with a story about the end of the first year of residency, when nine of her classmates decided to go skydiving over Hawaii. Jess and a friend took off in a plane about the size of a minivan, each of them strapped to a tandem instructor. Jess and her instructor jumped first. When they finally landed, exhilarated, her friend said that watching Jess step out of the plane had been the most terrifying part. By the final weekend of March, when Governor Andrew Cuomo designated SUNY-Downstate a covid-only hospital, Jess still had yet to see a confirmed case of the disease. Her days were spent, for the most part, on the phone with her suddenly house-bound patients, and on Zoom with her colleagues to prepare for the oncoming crush. The schedules for the new covid-19 wards were changing every day, and Jess expected to start consulting on them at any moment. But that Sunday morning, while our kids were playing Just Dance Now on the Apple TV, she developed a dry cough. She immediately put on a mask, and, when it was time for lunch, isolated herself to eat. That afternoon I drove over to her boss’s house, to pick up a thermometer. (Ours was broken, and I had confirmed earlier in the day that there were none to be had for purchase anywhere in our neighborhood.) Standing on his stoop, at a safe distance, Jess’s boss told me that the networks through which information about covid-19 was travelling, though faster now because of the Internet, reminded him of the early days of the aids epidemic, when he had been a young doctor. “It was just everybody asking each other what they were seeing,” he said. Later that night, I started feeling sick, as well. My symptoms were nowhere close to unbearable, and I had none of the now-classic covid-19 triad of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Instead, I had a dull ache behind the eyes, coupled with a general weariness. It was the sort of thing that, in another season, I’d have written off as an obnoxious but manageable cold. On Tuesday, however, Jess was able to get tested for covid-19. The next night, the chief resident texted her the result: positive. One of the strange and unsettling features of covid-19, as a disease, is that it appears to progress in a nonlinear fashion: people often feel bad, and then better, and then bad again. The possibility of a sudden downturn, it seems, is one that can’t be dismissed until you recover completely. For now, though, both of us have been lucky. Jess has not felt especially well, but she has been able to spend most of her daylight hours on the phone, helping her patients figure out how to get the routine medical services they need at a time when they can’t physically visit her clinic. Mental-health services, she says, are in particularly high demand: her patients, especially those with underlying conditions, are terrified that they’ll get sick, and that anxiety has become its own problem in need of resolution. Despite being able to do a version of her job from home, however, she is impatient to get back to the hospital, not least because she will likely have some immunity to the virus. By Thursday evening, suny Downstate had admitted more than two hundred and fifty inpatients with covid-19, and, on Saturday, the president of the hospital told CNN that his supply of surgical gowns was so low that his medical staff would have to start using rain ponchos and garbage bags instead. “We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and everyone wants to feel useful,” Jess told me. “For me, the thing I can do to be useful is to be back at work.” Hooman Kamel started his covid-19 rotation two weeks ago. In the days before he began, he told me, “I was just so despondent. It was so dark. And then I started, and I’m, like, all right, you know? Once you get into it, you see what you’re dealing with. I’ve been feeling much better. It’s still a terrible situation, and it’s stressful as hell. But it did feel like some of that gloom lifted.” When his rotation started, Kamel decided to shave his head, as he had during residency. In part, he said, he was nervous to spend the half-hour it would take to get a haircut in close proximity to another person, but, like Elizabeth Kaplan, he also felt a deep connection to his years of medical training. “It just felt, like, O.K., if we’re going back onto that kind of footing, let’s do it.” To protect his wife and kids—as well as his mother, who is seventy, and who’s been helping with night feedings—Kamel moved out of his apartment in Manhattan and into one owned by a friend, in Brooklyn. Each day, while he was at work, his wife found his car and delivered a few basic necessities: T-shirts, trash bags, beer. Eventually the strain of that separation became too much: last Monday, Kamel moved back home. “We’re technically on the front lines, but there are other people who have it much harder,” Kamel said, when I asked how he spent his days on the I.C.U. Paramedics and emergency doctors, he said, “are the ones who are working in much less controlled conditions. They really have no idea what they’re going to see. And then the airway team doing intubations—it is a tough thing, in general, in critically ill patients, but to be doing it with the layers of protective gear they have to wear, and the risk to themselves . . . ” Kamel’s I.C.U. was one of the first in the hospital to be dedicated entirely to covid-19 patients. The unit got its first case on March 15th, and by the time he showed up, on March 24th, all twelve of its available ventilators were in use. The ventilators will not cure anyone, but they will, with any luck, keep patients breathing long enough for their immune systems—at the moment, the only proven treatment for covid-19—to eradicate the disease. “The virus causes very diffuse pneumonia, all throughout the lungs,” he told me. “And then the body’s response to the virus, inflammation, causes damage. So the lungs aren’t functioning well, and it’s very hard to keep the oxygen levels in the blood up to where they need to be. And sometimes the ventilator settings you have to use are not comfortable. So most of the challenge is: how do you use the ventilator in a way where you can get enough oxygen into their blood without causing more damage to the lungs?” Kamel has had no trouble getting gowns, gloves, or procedure masks, but his hospital, like most, has a shortage of N95 masks. “Everyone at my place can get at least one N95, which they can then reuse,” he said. One mask per day, I asked him, or one per week? “They just get one,” he said. “It’s not ideal.” At the time we spoke, Kamel himself had three N95s—two of them sent to him by the primary-care physician in Minnesota—that he was cycling through. Each day, he wears one mask for the duration of his twelve-hour shift. At the end of the shift, being careful not to contaminate its concave surface, he puts the N95 in a paper bag and hopes that the forty-eight hours until its next use will be enough to kill any surviving virus. Then he goes home and puts on another mask to be around his wife and sons. “I am wearing a mask at all times, which is pretty terrible,” he told me. “I think the smell of surgical masks is going to be seared in my brain for life.” I asked Kamel what the mood was like inside the I.C.U. “It’s just the human condition, you know?” he said. “The highs and the lows. There are these poignant moments where you’re FaceTiming with a family member. I went into a room, put a patient’s daughter on the phone so she could see her mom. Her mom is sedated in a coma, on a ventilator, super sick. You’re watching the daughter cry. She’s unable to be there in person, because there’s all these restrictions on visitors to try to protect everyone from this virus. So that’s been super sad.” At the same time, he said, “Being with our staff, and seeing how everyone's rallying—like our nurses—has been incredible. They’re stepping up to the plate and figuring out how to reconfigure an I.C.U. to take care of these patients, and doing it with grace and good humor. That’s been pretty amazing to watch.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Why Widespread Coronavirus Testing Isn’t Coming Anytime Soon,27898,"This past Thursday, Donald Trump visited the National Response Coordination Center for a teleconference with the nation’s governors about how to handle the covid-19 pandemic. The center, which is situated inside the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, in Washington, is designed, in the agency’s words, to coördinate “the overall Federal support for major incidents and emergencies.” Trump—along with Mike Pence, and several other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials—sat around a table in a gray-walled conference room, while the governors were patched in from around the country. The governors said their states needed personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) for health-care workers, ventilators for patients, block grants for their balance sheets, and the National Guard to build hospitals and distribute food. They also needed tests. Kristi Noem, of South Dakota, said that her state’s public-health laboratory—the only lab doing covid-19 testing in the state—had so much trouble securing reagents that it was forced to temporarily stop testing altogether. “We, for two weeks, were requesting reagents for our public-health lab from C.D.C., who pushed us to private suppliers, who kept cancelling orders on us,” she said. In order to get her public-health lab the reagents it needed, Noem said, “we had to get a little pushy with a few people.” Trump and his team sought to reassure the governors. Admiral Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, who was appointed two weeks ago to coördinate the federal effort to get testing back on track, said, “We’re very effectively transitioning to large-scale testing by leveraging all components of our American health-care system, including C.D.C. and the state public-health labs, health care and hospitals, and large commercial labs.” Giroir told the governors that, in the twelve days between March 2nd and March 14th, more than ten million tests had been made available in the U.S. And, citing numbers from the F.D.A., he suggested that another seventeen million would be added by March 28th. “We have plenty of tests on the back side. We have plenty of supplies on the front side,” Giroir said. Pence, too, emphasized that “now tens of thousands of more tests are being performed literally every day,” while Trump, responding to Noem’s difficulties securing reagents, told her not to be concerned. “We got you, Kristi,” he said. “There is tremendous supply.” The next day, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists—which, together, represent virtually the whole of the country’s state-level public-health infrastructure—issued a joint statement warning about “widescale shortages of laboratory supplies and reagents” for covid-19 testing. Because of these shortages, the statement said, testing ought to be reserved for three groups of suspected cases: health-care workers and first responders; the elderly, especially those who live in nursing homes and other group settings; and people for whom a confirmed covid-19 diagnosis had the potential to meaningfully change their treatment plan, such as those with underlying health conditions. An alert sent out earlier in the day by New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was even more dire. Mildly or moderately ill people seeking covid-19 tests, the D.O.H.M.H. warned, posed a serious infection risk for hospitals and clinics, and were creating a run on the city’s extremely limited P.P.E. stocks and testing supplies. For that reason, the department was “directing healthcare facilities to IMMEDIATELY STOP TESTING NON-HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS FOR COVID-19 unless test results will impact the clinical management of the patient.” Even health-care workers and first responders who had been exposed to infected patients but did not have symptoms would no longer be tested. As the alert went on to warn, again in bold capital letters: “COVID-19 testing is only indicated for HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.” In late February, nearly three weeks after the first batch of C.D.C. test kits that was shipped to state and local labs proved faulty, the Trump Administration pushed through a series of regulatory moves to expand the nation’s test capacity. On February 29th, the F.D.A. allowed so-called high-complexity labs to develop and run their own tests. Starting on March 12th, the F.D.A. issued a series of Emergency Use Authorizations to commercial test companies, which allowed those companies to manufacture and distribute tests without going through the agency’s normally onerous approval process. And, last Monday, the F.D.A. announced a new policy that allows state and territorial public-health laboratories to authorize tests at other labs without the need for additional federal approval. In effect, the policy pushed regulatory authority for covid-19 testing out of the federal government and down to the states and territories. The F.D.A.’s changes succeeded in clearing away many of the regulatory obstacles to new testing. And yet they did little to solve what now appears to be the major bottleneck in deploying widespread testing across the United States. No longer do we need to worry about a single authorized test protocol, or a limited number of laboratories that are allowed to carry out that test. The current trouble is a critical shortage of the physical components needed to carry out tests of any variety. Among these components are so-called viral transport media, which are used to stabilize a specimen as it travels from patient to lab; extraction kits, which isolate viral RNA from specimens once they reach the lab; and the reagents that do the actual work of determining whether the coronavirus that causes covid19 is present in the sample. Perhaps the most prosaic shortage, but also the most crucial, is a lack of test swabs, which look like glorified Q-tips. Specially designed to preserve viral specimens, they’re what a doctor sticks up your nose or down your throat to collect the necessary biological material. The swab shortage is happening for the same reason that all the other test components are limited—namely, a global pandemic has created a global demand for them—but it is subject to a further complication. Copan, one of the major manufacturers of the sort of swabs needed for covid-19 tests, has its headquarters and manufacturing facilities in Lombardy, Italy, which has been hit particularly hard by the disease. A spokesperson for the company says that the national lockdown in Italy has not affected production at its factories, but last week the U.S. Air National Guard had to use one of its C-17 cargo planes to bring an order of eight hundred thousand swabs back to the U.S. According to Defense One, the plane flew on Monday from the Aviano Air Base, in Italy, not far from the headquarters of Copan, to Memphis, where a FedEx distribution center is situated; the Times later reported that the airlift had been arranged by Peter Navarro, a Presidential trade adviser, and that the Administration hoped similar efforts would bring 1.5 million swabs into the country every week. On Saturday, a company spokesperson told me that Copan did not make “special deals” with governments but was “shipping to the U.S.A. the maximum amount that we are capable of, on a best effort basis” through its usual distributors. The shortage of testing components is having its most drastic effects in the parts of the country that are seeing the highest prevalence of covid-19. According to Deborah Birx, the response coördinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, more than fifty per cent of confirmed cases of the disease have been found in just ten counties, in three states—Washington, New York, and California. In New York City, as of Monday, some fifteen thousand cases have been confirmed, about a third of the country’s total. (Given the testing deficit, the actual prevalence may be several times that.) According to Jennifer Rakeman, the director of the city’s public-health laboratory, “There’s widespread community transmission in New York City.” What that means for residents of the city, she said, is that “if you have symptoms of influenza—like a cough, shortness of breath, fever, sore throat—the pre-test probability that you have covid-19 is very, very high.” Rakeman’s lab, on First Avenue across from Bellevue Hospital, has been running tests for covid-19 since March 2nd, a few days after it was sent a new set of reagents to replace the first faulty kit it received from the C.D.C. At ordinary peak times, she told me, the lab operates one shift a day, five days a week. Since the outbreak hit the U.S., however, the lab’s staff has been working two shifts a day, seven days a week. By Monday, according to Andrew Cuomo, labs in the state of New York had tested nearly eighty thousand people, and were now processing sixteen thousand tests a day, a quarter of all tests nationwide. But that capacity has been threatened by what Rakeman describes as “critical” shortages of test components, including an enzyme called TaqPath, about which Rakeman said, “There are labs that are running out and begging other labs for a single tube so that they can get another day’s worth of testing done.” Rakeman told me that, after only ten days of using the C.D.C.-provided tests, her lab was down to its final two extraction kits. On March 12th, she sent members of the city’s Health Department to Albany, to pick up a batch of reagents that had been manufactured for a new test, based on the C.D.C. protocol but developed by New York State’s Wadsworth Laboratory, which would allow the city to use a wider range of extraction kits. “The car pulled into the lab at four o’clock in the afternoon,” she said. “Within minutes, those reagents were in the lab, and the lab started doing the validation and verification of that test. We ran that overnight, and finished it up on the morning of the 13th. That morning, we ran the last batch of specimens on the C.D.C. assay, finished up the last drop of our extraction kits for that test, and then immediately were able to switch over to the Wadsworth test.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures In states with far less prevalence of covid-19 than New York, the shortages are hampering the ability to keep the outbreak under manageable control. By Monday afternoon, the state of Minnesota had confirmed fewer than three hundred cases of the disease. Joanne Bartkus, the director of the state’s public laboratory, told me that she and her staff are capable of processing five hundred tests a day, but shortages of reagents and other test components have caused that number to drop as low as two hundred. “It really is a day-to-day thing as to how many we can test,” she said. When Bartkus’s lab started testing, at the beginning of March, demand was low. “We got five samples in the first day, and then maybe seven the next,” she said. But within days of the President’s announcement, on March 6th, that anyone who wanted a test could get a test, that trickle became a flood. “We started getting four hundred, six hundred, eight hundred, a thousand samples a day.” The influx of specimens created a backlog in the lab that only eased last week, after the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was able to begin testing. Bartkus has been in contact with other lab directors who are experiencing similar shortages. As of late last week, she said, a number of states were running out of TaqPath and extraction kits. Bill Whitmar, the director of Missouri’s state lab, says that he has so far received only three test kits from the C.D.C., and that he knows of commercial labs that have taken to freezing their specimens because they lack adequate test components and testing capacity. In recent weeks, Whitmar said, political pressure has made the problems even worse. Missouri is still, he guesses, at least several weeks behind New York and California on the epidemiological curve, which means that containing the outbreak through targeted testing of suspect cases remains a possibility. But recently, Whitmar told me, “National and state policymakers decided that we needed to offer testing to more individuals. Then the floodgates opened. When that happens, then the supply chain on the front end—which is the swabs, the viral transport media, the collection tubes—started to evaporate from the suppliers.” He went on: “If you think you’re going to test everybody, you have to look at your supply chain and analyze it closely. Not just make a promise, but look at your ability to provide a test for everybody. If you think you can, you may be surprised.” The testing situation in the United States is not wholly grim. According to the covid Tracking Project, the number of daily tests has grown from just under a thousand, on March 4th, to more than sixty-five thousand, on Monday. And the federal government has taken steps, such as the Aviano airlift, to address the test-component shortages. Scott Becker, the C.E.O. of the A.P.H.L., told me on Saturday that the Department of Health and Human Services had purchased two hundred thousand swabs, primarily from a company called Princeton Biomeditech, which it was shipping to state labs this past weekend. What’s more, the C.D.C. addressed the shortage in viral transport media by posting a protocol—essentially a recipe—for labs to make their own. (The protocol uses a mixture of saline solution and, among other things, blood serum drawn from fetal cattle⁠.) The federal government, Becker said, was “slowly waking up to the fact that this is an incredibly complex process. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Throwing money at the problem isn’t necessarily going to help it.” Still, the shortages are severe enough that they’re affecting even the large commercial labs, which as of Sunday were running more than fifty thousand tests per day. According to Julie Khani, the president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group representing those labs, “What I’m hearing about as the most critical needs are swabs, and also access to personal protective equipment, to make sure that laboratory employees and other health-care workers are protected.” Khani told me that her member companies had also noted critical shortages of extraction kits, reagents, and test kits. The companies plan to continue gradually expanding their testing capacity as much as they’re able, but to ease the supply-chain shortages, she said, they will “need the support of the U.S. government: we need the resources, we need the funding, and we need supplies.” If the most immediate problem in the United States is that there are too few available covid-19 tests, another concern is that there may soon be too many. On March 12th, the F.D.A. allowed the Wadsworth Laboratory, in Albany, to authorize other labs in the state to develop and run covid-19 tests. The next day, President Trump signed a memorandum instructing the F.D.A. to allow every other state public-health lab the same regulatory authority, which the agency put into effect on March 16th. Bill Whitmar, of Missouri, told me that he had received dozens of e-mails from companies seeking approval for their tests. “If I had a nickel for every company that said, ‘I’ve got a covid-19 test. I want you to take a look at her. Give me a call,’ I’d have enough for a tank of gas, for sure, and I’ve got a big truck.” As another clinical-lab director put it, “Every company is coming out of the woodwork saying, ‘I have the best test in the world,’ and ninety-five per cent of them will probably be crap.” The clinical lab director expressed concern that granting regulatory authority to the states means that “we are now in the Wild West of laboratory regulation. It’s really a let-the-buyer-beware world. Essentially, apart from the F.D.A.’s E.U.A. process, there is very limited regulation of the quality, accuracy, and specificity of diagnostic tests for covid-19, and I think that’s a dangerous situation.” Bartkus, in Minnesota, said, “I will tell you, there is pressure to get these tests out: from the public, from the laboratories, from the politicians. It is a challenge to do that in a scientific and equitable way when you have no expertise in authorizing other labs to do testing.” She forwarded me an infographic published by the F.D.A. that explains the new policy. Its headline says, “States Are Now in Charge of Testing.” “Other laboratory directors looked at it and thought it was a hoax,” she said. “It’s almost like the F.D.A. has thrown in the towel and said, ‘Hey, you know, do whatever.’ ” According to Becker, who called Trump’s memorandum an “overcorrection,” the Wadsworth Laboratory, in New York, has both the infrastructure and the experience to conduct oversight on other labs, but the same was not true in most other states. “It’s an added burden to labs that are already under excruciating pressure,” he said. “In the midst of an emergency, it sounds like a good idea, but I don’t think it’s very practical.” (In response to these criticisms, on Monday, an F.D.A. spokesperson said, in a statement, “This action demonstrates the F.D.A.’s ability to pivot and adapt as the situation warrants in light of a public-health emergency,” adding that “our guidance provides recommendations for states that choose to utilize this voluntary and flexible approach.”) Last week, I received my own pitch from a company hoping to bring a new covid-19 test to market. The company, PathogenDx, was founded in 2014, and sells DNA-based microarray tests to help farmers and agricultural distributors detect biological contaminants on their crops. According to Milan Patel, the company’s C.E.O. and co-founder, PathogenDx has found a particular market niche among cannabis growers. When we spoke on Friday, Patel told me that he had previously hoped to bring the microarray technology to the medical market, but that the F.D.A. approval process had made that impractical. “It would have taken ten years and fifty times more money for us to have to educate the F.D.A. to accept such a technology, because it was completely new and groundbreaking and disruptive. And we just didn’t have the money.” At best, he thought, the company might have been able to enter the human-diagnostics market in the next few years. “But this window of opportunity happened now,” he said, referring to the present pandemic, “and so we have to act.” When I asked what he would tell someone who might be concerned that a cannabis company was pivoting to covid-19 testing in the middle of an emergency, he admitted that he would be nervous, too. “But at the end of the day what we would say is, look, we’ve gotten a hundred labs doing just the same level of testing, but it’s for E. coli, salmonella, and a bunch of pathogens. And we have enough validation data to show you. We’re going to go to the same level of validation with the F.D.A. as well.” Patel told me that PathogenDx applied for an emergency-use authorization from the F.D.A. this past Saturday, even though the company does not yet have a test that it is ready to submit for external validation. Why not, I asked, wait to file for the E.U.A. until the test was externally validated? “The thinking is, there’s a hundred companies ahead of us,” Patel told me. “The F.D.A. will close the door. They’ll say, ‘We’ve got more than enough companies.’ So we’re submitting it so that we can get our foot through the door.” Also last week, at least two companies with previous medical-diagnostic experience, Nurx and Everlywell, announced that they would soon begin selling home-testing kits for covid-19. Both companies said that they would use telemedicine health-care providers to screen orders, and both planned to send qualified patients swabs and collection kits that will be mailed to clinical laboratories for analysis. Frank Ong, the chief medical and scientific officer of Everlywell, told me on Friday that his company had thirty thousand kits, including swabs, on hand, and hoped to be able to supply more than two hundred thousand kits in the coming weeks. Some of those kits may go to corporate partners, while others would be sold to consumers through Everlywell’s Web site. According to Ong, his company believed that it could legally distribute its kits because the labs it was using to analyze test specimens were operating under the F.D.A.’s revised emergency-use policy. But that policy explicitly stated that it “does not apply to at home testing.” On Friday, after I spoke to Ong, the agency repeated that warning in a strongly worded public notice. After acknowledging that it saw the “public health value in expanding the availability of covid-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection,” and noting that it was working with at-home test-kit developers, the agency said that it had “not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for covid-19.” (Nurx paused its plans to provide at-home testing for covid-19 following the F.D.A.’s announcement.) On Sunday, I spoke to Julia Cheek, Everlywell’s C.E.O. and founder, about the F.D.A.’s announcement. Cheek told me that, unlike a pregnancy test, which was a true at-home test, her company was technically selling an at-home collection kit. Therefore, as she understood it, the test was not in conflict with the F.D.A’s revised emergency-use policy. Everlywell had planned to start selling kits on Monday, for a hundred and thirty-five dollars each. But given the agency’s notice on Friday, she said, the company had decided that it would wait for further guidance before selling to consumers. (On Monday evening, Deborah Birx, of the Coronavirus Task Force, said at a press briefing that “for all of us waiting for self-swabbing options, those are going to be available at some time this week.” But an F.D.A. spokesperson on Tuesday pointed me to a statement, published a day earlier, that said “self-collection at home or at sites other than designated collection sites staffed by [health-care providers] is currently not recommended.”) In the meantime, Everlywell planned to make some of its kits available for those in health-care settings, such as doctors and nurses in front-line-care settings and older patients in long-term-care facilities. The ability to test at scale appears to have been a crucial—though far from the only—means by which China, South Korea, Singapore, and other countries have been able to control their epidemics. In the U.S., the imposition of lockdowns in Washington, New York, and California have only amplified the demand for a comprehensive testing program that would, ideally, allow for a more targeted strategy of contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine. During an interview on CNN on Monday night, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, “That’s how we’ll restart the economy.” But multiple public-health officials told me that the supply-chain constraints mean that such a program will be, for the near future, impossible to implement. And if there’s anything worse than not having tests for covid-19 broadly available, they say, it’s treating what testing capacity we do have like an unlimited resource. “Had we had access to high-volume, quality testing prior to there being community transmission,” Rakeman, the director of the New York City lab, told me, “a lot of testing would have been helpful, and maybe would have helped containment.” But, given the prevalence of covid-19 in the city, she said, test results for people who are mildly or moderately ill have little therapeutic or epidemiological value. “When we talk about testing capacity, it sort of gives this tacit message that people should be tested, and feeds into that anxiety: ‘I need to get tested. I need to know my status,’ ” Rakeman said. “You don’t need to know your covid status.” Anyone who suspects they have covid-19 should call a doctor, but in New York, unless you belong to a high-priority category, the recommendation will likely be the same regardless of whether you have the test: stay home for two weeks, or until you’re fever-free for seventy-two hours. In any case, Rakeman said, “If you have a cough and a fever and a sore throat, or any of those, you probably have it.” A larger problem, Rakeman told me, is that widespread demand for testing is exacerbating the critical shortage of masks and other P.P.E. The supply of available P.P.E. in New York is currently so low that, on Friday, Cuomo put out a public call to manufacturers to address it: “We will pay a premium for these products,” he said. As Rakeman told me, “Hospitals are going to run out of P.P.E. in the next couple of weeks, if not sooner. And any mask that is used now at a doctor’s office or a pop-up tent that’s providing ‘drive-through testing’ is a mask that’s not going to be available for a health-care worker in a couple of weeks.” Patients seeking testing can also be potent vectors for the disease. “Take a scenario where, say, I have a cough, or a sore throat and a fever, but I’m not sick enough that I need to go to the hospital,” Rakeman said. “If I travel from my home to an urgent-care facility, I’m going to spread the virus to whomever I come into contact with. When I get there, the person who collects my specimen has to wear P.P.E. I’ve also exposed that health-care worker and everybody who works in that office, and all of the other patients, who may not be there for flulike illness.” She added, “By going out and getting a test, you’re potentially killing somebody’s loved one.” Even outside of New York City, Khani told me, “You have to prioritize who gets tested. We don’t have the testing capacity that we need, and that’s why we want to make sure that those who need testing most have access to testing.” In Missouri, where the odds that someone has covid-19 are still likely lower than they are in other states, Bill Whitmar said that he understands why the first instinct for someone suffering covid-like symptoms would be to seek out confirmation. The tests “give people a feeling that they’re being taken care of. It’s a step that will make you feel a little bit better in this time of unease.” Nevertheless, he said, it was crucial to suppress this urge, at least for the time being. “I understand that the policymakers are trying to help their constituents. However, by doing that, you’re actually reducing the ability for people who really need the test to be able to get the test.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. The U.S. as a whole may be able to flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak, but prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers can expect to see a largely “uncontrolled, unflattened curve,” an epidemiology professor said.

"“The House of God,” a Book as Sexist as It Was Influential, Gets a Sequel",20237,"In 1978, the psychiatrist Stephen Bergman published the novel “The House of God,” written under the pen name Samuel Shem. Based on Bergman’s experiences as an intern at Harvard’s Beth Israel hospital, the book rapidly became a staple of any medical resident’s required-reading list; to date, it has sold more than two million copies. A 2003 edition included an introduction by John Updike, who wrote that “The House of God” “could probably not be written now, at least so unabashedly; its lavish use of freewheeling, multiethnic caricature would be inhibited by the current terms ‘racist,’ ‘sexist,’ and ‘ageist.’ Its ’70s sex is not safe.” For Updike, for those who made this argument before him, and for those who continue to make it today, a measure of freedom has been lost in a culture that requires writers to watch their words for unintended cruelty. An army of chiding librarians seems to have arisen, tsk-tsk-ing the poor writer’s bawdy, outrageous imagination. Updike’s concern is embodied in the real phenomena of Twitter pile-ons and sensitivity readers, but it is also Foucauldian: the chiding librarian is within us, suppressing the writer’s creativity before it even makes it to the page. In the panopticon where every action can be seen, known, and embedded in a tweet, no actual chains are required. Ultimately, we control ourselves. “The House of God” is “not a great book,” the literary critic Kathryn Montgomery has written, “but it is an important book.” Bergman claims that it shows how residents are dehumanized in the course of their sleepless, gruelling medical training, and in turn begin behaving cruelly or carelessly toward their patients. As the physician and poet Jack Coulehan has pointed out, however, Bergman undercuts his argument somewhat when his narrator, Roy Basch, refers to patients as “a heifer” and “a hippo” on his first day of work. If the narrator’s callous attitude toward patients is a product of the dehumanizing power of residency training, how did Basch get there so quickly? Coulehan argues that the novel does a disservice to medical-student readers, who “internalize the message that clinical training is dehumanizing without sufficiently noticing that the group most dehumanized is patients.” Others, such as the emergency physician Jay Baruch, argue that the novel’s descriptions of the disgust, shame, and horror that patient care sometimes evokes comprise a badly needed articulation of the lived experience of residents. “The House of God” likely contributed to some of the reforms in medical training that have come about since the nineteen-seventies, particularly in regard to long work hours that lead to sleep deprivation. The book is taught in medical schools and quoted by physicians; whether we realize it or not, we are quoting “The House of God” when we say, for example, “The first procedure in any cardiac arrest is to take your own pulse.” More than forty years after its publication, many of the book’s episodes, such as the suicide of an intern, still feel contemporary. Other bits are frighteningly dated or always felt slanted, particularly the portrayal of women. The book’s nurses have none of the clinical insight or skill of actual nurses, but they’re eager to reveal their montes pubis for the interns. There is just one female physician, a frigid, universally loathed character named Jo. The last of the women is Roy Basch’s partner, Berry, who is intelligent but inexplicably content to serve as a surrogate mother for Basch, while displaying no expectation that he might broaden her horizons in turn, or even refrain from copulating with nurses. As sympathetic as I am to Updike’s concerns about social control, and as nostalgic as I may be for the time when I wrote like a child—blithe, mindless of consequence, the only audience in my mind an audience of people who already loved me—I am no longer a child. These days, I write not only for my best friends but for general readers. Growing up involves coming to realize that others are as human as oneself, with inner lives at least as rich as one’s own. The realization that others have inner lives is a developmental milestone that we humans are supposed to achieve around age four. But, as it turns out, many of us are still working on it, decades later. Or perhaps we gain the ability to imagine the lives of others around age four, but we may or may not put that ability into practice. I look to literature to attune my mind to the inner lives of other people, and it is painful when a book falls so short of deeply imagining the other that it portrays some whole wings of the world as flat, airless, not truly worth inhabiting. It is ironic, in a sick way, when the art that ought to bring us closer accidentally insists that some of us are not really worth the effort. I read “The House of God” in medical school, as many of us do, and was left looking askance at my chosen field. Because the book is lionized so uncritically in my profession, I could only suspect that my future colleagues did not hold women in particularly high regard. Bergman and his apologists (including many of my women colleagues in medicine) say that “The House of God” was simply a novel of its time. When asked about the novel’s sexism in a recent interview, Bergman replied, “I was roundly criticized for the way women were seen” in the book, then launched into an anecdote about a doctor and nurse having sex in an on-call room in the nineteen-seventies. “Things have changed,” Bergman added. The anecdote is telling, with its implication that feminist thinkers object to sex itself, rather than to the portrayal of women as sex objects. The accusation that women who display the capacity for critical thought must be frigid is a tired one, and one given full treatment in the character of Jo—the only woman in “House” who occupies a position of authority, the “lonely single woman” whose supervision of Basch and her other male subordinates equates to “lop[ping] a bit off his schlong daily by telling him what he’d failed to do.” Other authors have managed to see women in health care as complex humans: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, in “Cancer Ward”; Michael Ondaatje, in “The English Patient”; Elizabeth Norman, in the beautiful and deeply researched “We Band of Angels.” As more women have trained as medical professionals, physician writers such as Danielle Ofri, Pauline Chen, the former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, and the Navajo surgeon Lori Arviso Alvord have told our stories in memoirs. Part of a book’s essential work is to bring readers deeply into the worlds of others, and thus it is fair to criticize authors who make no attempt to examine the worlds of whole categories of people. As Eudora Welty said of her stories and novels, “What I do in writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart, and skin of a human being who is not myself. Whether this happens to be a man or a woman, old or young, with skin black or white, the primary challenge lies in making the jump itself. It is the act of a writer’s imagination that I set most high.” It is odd to blame the times, then, for a failure of imagination—that freewheeling, unabashed thing that Updike prized. The other defense of “The House of God” that I commonly hear is “But it’s satire!” And “The House of God” is wonderfully effective satire insofar as it points an accusatory finger at systems of power in medicine. But the spectacle of the male Harvard Medical School graduate satirizing women colleagues is painful; good satire deflates systems of power, not the people who toil and suffer in those systems. Naturally, I turned to “Man’s 4th Best Hospital,” the recent sequel to “The House of God,” with cautious curiosity. I wondered if a forty-year career as a psychiatrist could have acquainted Bergman with the notion that women have inner lives. The novel’s first sentence—“Except for her eyes, Berry is fully clothed”—dimmed my hopes only somewhat. Roy Basch is back, and his life in the years between the two books maps closely with Bergman’s. Both men married a psychologist who believes that profound and fixed differences between genders not only exist but also can begin to be bridged by using the word “we” more frequently; both adopted a daughter from overseas; both became psychiatrists with a special focus on addiction medicine; both wrote a novel called “The House of God.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" In the first chapter, Basch and Berry are staying at their Costa Rican finca, and Basch requires stitches from a Tica physician. “When she bent over to examine me,” he describes, “I could not help noticing that her purple blouse was—to use a line from The House—‘unbuttoned down past Thursday,’ breasts cradled in the lace palms of a pink bra. . . . As she left . . . I noticed she was wearing tight bright pink pants and red high heals—make that heels.” For Basch, this is “familiar ground: sex and death. Especially in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, in the daily horror of lingering disease and death, the healthy sex with the nurses, orgasms crying out We’re still alive and young! At the threat of disease and death, the sensual, the vital—and, yes, the hope.” Now, I happen to be a woman physician. I can’t speak for the whole crowd of us, but I think that most of us do not wish for our breasts to be ogled while we stitch—even if it makes our septuagenarian patients feel “sensual” and “vital.” Even if Basch’s ogling of the doctor is nauseating, his point about the erotics of medicine has something true in it. All that death does make one wish to prove that one is alive oneself, and that life offers something more exalted than excretion and suffering. Sex is a high line to pleasure, and I have friends both male and female who did fornicate their ways around the cities of their internship. Mostly we were too tired for fornication, though, or we were in love with our spouses and sensible enough to be faithful to the ones who kept us fed and sane. There is an actual orgy in the call room in “The House of God” which, in retrospect, feels quaint. What intern has time for an orgy these days? You would get paged out of it within ten minutes. (It occurs to me that I am a pediatrician, and it could just be that children’s hospitals are particularly undersexed. Perhaps, in adult hospitals, the loamy must of sex luffs up around bedpans and ventilators, and interns must splash through puddles of semen to get to their call-room beds. I’ve no way to know!) Although many of the characters, including the physicians, in “Man’s 4th Best Hospital” are women, and, although Bergman has gotten beyond the trope of nurse as dumb mons, his depiction of gender is still old-fashioned. Men are strong and zany and ha-ha funny; women are sensitive and moral and wise, happy either to bed the men or to mother them. (Berry refers to Basch’s moral education as her “full-time job in the medical field.”) In one memorable scene, a nurse named Molly allows Basch to come up to her apartment and fondle her “remarkably caressable breasts and strangely long nipples,” for old times’ sake, then does him the service of reminding him of his wife’s existence, putting an end to the dalliance before penetration can occur. The virile Basch’s formidable sex drive is thwarted, but later he is grateful and falls to his knees on the sidewalk—thank goodness Berry never needs to know! Molly goes on to work alongside Berry when she, too, joins the clinic. There is minimal drama and no consequences for Basch—a male fantasy fulfilled, even if there was no penetration. The other aspects of Basch’s privilege also go unexamined, and his flaunting of his privilege as a doctor and a wealthy person makes me, as a fellow-physician, cringe. At one point in “Man’s 4th Best,” Basch develops an abnormal heart rhythm and has to go to the hospital. He calls a fellow-doctor en route, and that doctor promises to get a cardiologist to come in and care for Basch. Once at the hospital, Basch continues to lobby for special treatment: I had learned that if I—or any of my family—go to a doctor, it’s helpful to say I’m a doctor, and when they ask what kind, I tell them and then ask, ‘Have you heard of the novel The House of God?’ Almost always they perk up and say, ‘Oh, yeah, it’s my favorite book!’ ‘Well, I wrote it.’ … And then the word spreads throughout the [emergency ward] and we all get a lot of attention. Docs and nurses crowd the room, want to chat, almost always telling me where they were when they’d read my novel. For anyone who has struggled to receive proper attention from physicians, this passage could be a little hard to take. It is also difficult to feel sympathy with the Basch family for their financial troubles, which condemn them to owning a vacation finca and also a large Boston-area estate and confine them only to the carriage house of the estate while they rent out the main house. Basch goes into an alcoholic tailspin from the stress of working extra shifts in order to afford their adopted daughter’s private preschool. (“My 24,000 dollar city taxes would have paid for excellent public school,” he explains. “But we’d tried it with Spring—it didn’t work. She was terribly shy.”) I have many shortcomings as a human, and one of them is my failure to sympathize with the struggles of the wealthy to secure private-school spots for their children. I was so shy that my preschool teachers thought that I had a developmental disability, and I still managed to survive public school in rural Texas, where abstinence-only sex education ruled the day and where we dissected a single rat that we shared as a class. Now I am not only a doctor but also some kind of arbiter of taste, called upon by The New Yorker to review this book. All this unexpected glory, despite having shared the rat. I’m sure that I was protected by old-fashioned white privilege in public school; I was urged to the front of the class. The parents who really have to worry about the fates of their children in public school rarely have the luxury of choice. Nor should Updike have worried that the “racist” label would eliminate “free-wheeling multiethnic caricature” from Bergman’s writing. “House” employed caricatures of black and Irish-American people, among others. Bergman portrays Navajo people as fully realized characters in “Man’s 4th Best,” but a Latino physician character is still a racist parody whose Spanish is incorrect. “Mia madre!” he says, and “Esta mucho discombobulay,” and “El segundo causa,” and “Merck Vioxx kill my madre!”—and it is unclear if this Spanish is deliberately incorrect or if it has simply been believed to be correct, in a country where literate Spanish speakers are abundant and could correct it. Basch frequently nods to the struggles of the working class, or, as he refers to them, “all the poor and middle-class patients I’d seen who were only one illness away, in our nation’s piss-poor health-care system, from bankruptcy.” And the explicit mission of the book is to “make medicine humane again.” (Boring!) The book advocates, in its way, for universal access to health care as a cure not only for physical suffering and injustices in the system but also for the misery of physicians. Given these explicit missions, Shem’s tone-deaf approach to the narrative effects of privilege-flaunting is unfortunate. In recent months, since I finished residency and began working as an attending physician, my way has been smoothed by the grunt work and flattery of trainees. My residents mine the electronic medical record for data and compose my notes; my medical students actually laugh out loud at my jokes. I recognize the precarity of all this, the seductive notion that this deference is not a consequence of a pernicious hierarchy but rather a consequence of my own hard work, wisdom, and virtue. I hope always to deserve the respect of my team. I hope never to be the dupe making sexist jokes that aren’t funny, to whom nobody in the room is willing to tell the truth. I hope to remember that I am a wealthy person now, and hand-wringing about the cost of private preschool would render me as unsympathetic as a self-appointed advocate for the oppressed. Perhaps forty years of deference explain why Shem, like Updike, writes as a child would, imagining an audience that will express only adoration. Perhaps it explains why Basch presumes that his book is everybody’s favorite, and that the doctors and nurses in the E.R. are gathering round to admire him. Some of them undoubtedly are, but a good portion of them are just staring at a fascinating specimen. We medical folk are simple people, and a famous writer in the E.R., like a case of Sydenham’s chorea or an interestingly shaped object lodged in a rectum, excites our general interest. So what is enough to ask of an elder male writer in this era? I think we women want revenge; we want “blood on the ceiling,” as Patricia Lockwood gave us in her recent epic takedown of Updike, in the London Review of Books. But also, perhaps, we want the possibility of individual moral progress, particularly among powerful men who have used their power to demean us. We want to recognize that progress when it comes, even as we continue to deserve real justice. Even if I would not wish to be or know the women in Bergman’s book, I recognize an effortful appreciation of women here. In medicine, we are only just beginning to reckon with our gender-based wage gap, our failure to promote women leaders, our utter indifference to the needs of working mothers, and the systematic harassment of women trainees. Led by groups like Time’s Up Healthcare, we are beginning to discuss these things. It is all too slow, and, on my more exhausted days, I wish for torches and pitchforks rather than just these words. Jo, the only female resident in “The House of God,” is also the only resident from that book who does not reappear in “Man’s 4th Best Hospital”; she doesn’t even rate a mention. Her character was instructive to me when I first read “The House of God,” because she symbolized so precisely the implicit threats levied against women who seek a career in medicine: that, if we do this unfeminine work, we will become hard and cold. If we assume leadership positions, the men we supervise will see us as schlong-lopping harpies.These threats are powerful tools of social control, instructing women in medicine that we must contort ourselves somehow into sexually available playthings, even as we thread catheters into femoral arteries and stuff tubes down the throats of the dying. For refusing to be pretty or sexy or soft, Jo was hated. I would have liked to see Jo return, to see the consequences of her treatment in “The House of God” explored many years later. I would like to know if we women in medicine—particularly those who have been harassed and demeaned and underpaid—get to live full lives, after all. I would like to know if we ever get to be both women physicians and people, or if the two conditions are incompatible.

Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All Dilemma,11539,"In September, 2017, as Republicans in Congress were pursuing an effort to abolish the Affordable Care Act—which ultimately failed in the Senate by one vote—Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Medicare for All Act of 2017, which would have enrolled all Americans in a new national health-insurance scheme called the Universal Medicare Program. “At a time when millions of Americans do not have access to affordable health care, the Republicans, funded by the Koch brothers, are trying to take away health care from up to thirty-two million more,” Sanders said. “We have a better idea: guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.” Although the Medicare for All Act was primarily identified with Sanders, who had proposed the same idea during his 2016 Presidential bid, it was co-sponsored by sixteen other Democratic senators. At least six of them were also considered to be possible 2020 Presidential candidates: Cory Booker, Al Franken, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkley, and Elizabeth Warren. The bill had the endorsement of a large number of progressive groups, including Our Revolution, MoveOn, the Working Families Party, Friends of the Earth, credo, and the Progressive Campaign Change Committee. With the G.O.P. in control of both houses of Congress, the bill went nowhere, but the support it achieved confirmed that many progressive Democrats were eager to move beyond Obamacare and embrace a single-payer system. In April of this year, Sanders reintroduced his Medicare for All Act and issued a white paper laying out some options for financing such a system, which, according to an Urban Institute study of Sanders’s 2016 campaign proposal, would ultimately raise federal expenditures by about three trillion dollars a year. The options included higher taxes on the rich; a 7.5 per cent payroll tax paid by employers; and a “4 percent income-based premium paid by employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four.” Because private-insurance plans would be eliminated under the Sanders bill, insurance premiums would also vanish, and the white paper asserted that “the average American family will save thousands of dollars a year because it will no longer be writing large checks to private health insurance companies.” Still, the fact remained that implementing Medicare for All would likely require raising income taxes on a majority of American households. By April, Franken had resigned, and Merkley had decided not to enter the 2020 race. The four confirmed contenders from the Senate, aside from Sanders—Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, and Warren—all co-sponsored the Medicare for All Act again, which was hardly surprising. If they had backed away from the Sanders bill, they would have attracted criticism from the left. None of them were doing particularly well in the polls at the time, and so sticking to their prior position must have seemed like the safest political move. Even so, at least a couple of them tried to preserve some wiggle room. Warren started out the year by portraying her support for Medicare for All as a statement about aspirations rather than a commitment to the particulars of the Sanders plan. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, in January, she identified “affordable health care for every American” as her goal and said that there were “different ways we can get there.” At a CNN town-hall meeting in March, she said that there were “a lot of different pathways” to universal coverage, and added, “What we’re all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.” But, unlike in many other policy areas, Warren didn’t propose an over-all health-care-reform plan of her own, as Harris did, or back away from the commitment to eliminate private insurance, as Booker did, sort of. Warren was rolling out so many proposals that her campaign started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan “warren has a plan for that.” But in the area of health care she confined herself to relatively narrow proposals, including measures to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, expand rural health-care programs, and tackle the opioid crisis. (That’s not to say that these proposals weren’t important individually, merely that they didn’t add up to a comprehensive reform plan.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold At the first Democratic debate, in June, Warren said, “I’m with Bernie on Medicare,” and she also raised her hand when the candidates were asked to indicate whether they favored getting rid of private health insurance. But she didn’t emphasize this in her over-all pitch, and she didn’t get pressed on it. Things changed after she began vying for the lead with Joe Biden in the polls. Front-runners get treated differently than mere contenders: the media scrutinizes everything they say and do, and their fellow-candidates try to take them down. During Tuesday’s debate, Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar zeroed in on Warren’s apparent reluctance to acknowledge explicitly that taxes would go up as part of a Medicare for All plan. “We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,” Klobuchar said. In response to these criticisms, Warren restated her support for Medicare for All, but also tweaked it slightly, saying, “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” The debate left Warren with a dilemma. Should she stick to her current position, which is at least partly designed to avoid giving Trump and the Republicans a talking point—“Warren wants to raise your taxes”—or should she refine it in some way? Some progressives believe she is in the right place. “Democratic voters want to beat Trump and appreciate Democratic politicians who are savvy,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told The Hill on Wednesday. “I don’t see why we would give the insurance companies rope to hang Democrats with a deceptive talking point. The bottom line is that Medicare for All will function like a tax cut for families.” Felicia Wong, the president of the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, also defended Warren’s approach. In an e-mail to me, Wong wrote, “Senator Warren has started with the basics: Everyone needs health care. And everyone agrees that the system isn’t working. So we need a big national conversation about structuring government as a public provider. That’s an upstream fight. And that is the campaign Sen. Warren is running.” Sticking to the current strategy won’t stop the onslaught from other candidates. On Wednesday, Biden questioned Warren’s “credibility” and said, “She’s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people.” In an interview with CNN, Buttigieg claimed that, during the debate, Warren was “more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she’s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.” A second option is for Warren to provide more details about the sort of Medicare for All proposal she would support, and maybe even unveil one of her own. On Wednesday, her campaign took a small step in this direction. In a statement provided to CNN, it said that the candidate was “reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates.” The CNN report said that the Warren campaign “declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.” The potential danger of proceeding down this path is that it might further enmesh Warren in the fiendish complexities of health-care reform, which could divert attention away from her many other plans, including her wealth tax and proposal for universal child care. Warren’s third option, and the one I think she is most likely to choose, involves qualifying her commitment to Medicare for All by again emphasizing its aspirational nature, and stressing that, if she does get elected, other priorities would come first. Adopting this strategy would be less of a reversal than a return to where she started. In an interview with Vox’s Ezra Klein, shortly before the debate in June, Warren said that her first two priorities would be pursuing her anti-corruption package, which would severely restrict the activities of lobbyists and create a new U.S. Office of Public Integrity, and passing her wealth tax. She said that Medicare for All was a “fight that matters to me” but didn’t give any timetable for engaging in it. Just like the other two strategies, this one would have potential costs. Supporters of Sanders, who is reportedly about to receive the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, could well accuse Warren of backsliding. Other Democratic primary voters, many of whom identify health care as their biggest policy concern, may get a bit confused. But moving in this direction would have the great merit of accurately reflecting Warren’s over-all policy platform. Sanders, to his credit, has doggedly supported socialized medicine for decades, even when it was far less popular than it is today. He has other policies, but Medicare for All is his signature plan. If he were to win the Democratic nomination and the general election, he would certainly try to enact some version of his Medicare for All Act, and the effort would likely consume much his Presidency, just as passing the Affordable Care Act consumed much of Obama’s first term. Warren is in a different position. Rather than having her name attached to a single issue, she wants to lead a wide-ranging effort to correct some of the excesses and failures of twenty-first-century capitalism and create a new social contract. Given the range and depth of the policy proposals she has put forward, she can credibly claim to have laid out a framework for beginning such a transformation, which could ultimately include the introduction of a single-payer health-care plan that guarantees universal coverage. At the moment, though, her ill-defined association with Sanders’s Medicare for All proposal risks obscuring the rest of her program. I would expect her to clarify it, and soon.

Why Doctors Should Organize,16400,"In the fall of 2018, the American College of Physicians published a position paper on gun violence. “Firearm violence continues to be a public health crisis in the United States,” its authors wrote, in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. The report argued that assault weapons should be banned and that “physicians should counsel patients on the risk of having firearms in the home.” When it was published, the National Rifle Association responded with a tweet: “Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.” The N.R.A.’s tweet provoked an unprecedented response from the medical profession. Using the hashtag #ThisIsMyLane, emergency-room physicians, trauma surgeons, pediatricians, and pathologists, all of whom are involved in the care of patients with gunshot wounds, posted images of shooting victims and bloodstained hospital floors. Some shared selfies in which they were splattered with blood. “Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly? This isn’t just my lane. It’s my fucking highway,” Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist, tweeted. Melinek’s tweet went viral. Doctors appeared on television and wrote op-eds expressing their disgust with the N.R.A. As a physician, I was thrilled by this display of solidarity and political engagement. But I also wondered why such mobilizations aren’t more common. In October, 1980, when I was a medical resident at San Francisco General Hospital, a group of interns and residents went on strike, protesting a disastrous shortage of nurses. (We also asked for on-site childcare, and, less crucially, a lounge with a Ping-Pong table and better food.) At the time, I was a resident in the Coronary Care Unit, and so was involved in the care of critically ill patients; as a result, I was allowed to cross the picket line. Still, my peers booed me. I remember that the chief of the medical service stood at the hospital entrance, demanding, through a bullhorn, that the doctors get back to work. My colleagues were defiant, and the strike continued for a few days, stopping only when the hospital agreed to alleviate the nursing shortage. The strike was organized by the San Francisco Interns and Residents Association—a union whose current iteration, this past March, protested low pay and poor working conditions with a fifteen-minute walkoff at the University of California, San Francisco’s Medical Center. There have been some other efforts to form unions of doctors, such as the California-based Union of American Physicians and Dentists. But they haven’t caught on industry-wide—the U.A.P.D. has only four thousand members—and, in my long career, the 1981 strike remains one of the few times I’ve seen doctors come together around a common cause. In truth, its stakes were small compared to the problems physicians must confront today. Doctors now face a burnout epidemic: thirty-five per cent of them show signs of high depersonalization, a type of emotional withdrawal that makes personal connections with their patients difficult. Administrative tasks have become so burdensome that, according to one recent report, only thirteen per cent of a physician’s day, on average, is spent on doctor-patient interaction. Another careful study of doctors’ time has shown that, during an average eleven-hour workday, six hours are spent at the keyboard, maintaining electronic health records. The widespread usage of electronic medical records began in the nineteen-nineties—it’s taken decades to transform doctors into data-entry clerks, a process Atul Gawande described, in this magazine, last year—and yet, in all that time, the adoption of such systems never met with aggressive pushback. Similarly, doctors were unsuccessful in resisting the rise of health-management organizations, which represented only three million patients in 1970 but, by 1999, had enrolled eighty million. Intended to reduce health-care costs, H.M.O.s have mainly succeeded in shifting control from doctors to health-care-system managers. In 1992, Medicare adopted the “relative value unit,” or R.V.U., a compensation metric that takes into account the medical service provided and the expense embedded in that service. The formula’s output—currently $36.04 per R.V.U.—structurally overhauled physician reimbursement, diminishing the value of non-procedural or cognitive doctor activity. And yet the major medical professional organizations went along with the practice, helping to negotiate the rate, instead of more seriously challenging it. Privately, doctors feel despair about their appalling working conditions and the deteriorating doctor-patient relationship. But there have been no marches on Washington, no picket lines, no social-media campaigns. Why not? Why aren’t doctors standing up for themselves and their patients? In theory, doctors could be a powerful force. There are more than a million physicians in the United States, and around nine hundred thousand are actively practicing. But the country’s largest medical organization, the American Medical Association, has only around two hundred and fifty thousand members. (The next-largest—the American College of Physicians, which represents internal-medicine specialists—has about a hundred and sixty thousand.) Most of the smaller societies represent a subspecialty and have correspondingly fewer members each. The A.M.A. once represented three-fourths of all American doctors; the growth of subspecialty societies may have contributed to its diminishment. In any case, there is no single organization that unifies all doctors. The profession is balkanized. The power and impact of medical organizations is further diminished because their priority—supporting their constituents—is often at odds with the needs of the public. As a long-term member of the American College of Cardiology, I was impressed with how effectively the organization lobbied for preserving the reimbursement rates of cardiologists. (Since cardiology is a procedure-rich specialty, the introduction of R.V.U.s has been better for us than for, say, primary-care physicians.) The college also provides educational programs for its members and puts on annual national meetings. But the A.C.C. does very little to promote the interests of patients, which is why I have recently withheld my dues. Like many medical societies, it is primarily a trade guild centered on the finances of doctors. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" On many occasions, medical societies have turned entirely inward, pursuing business as an end in itself. In the nineteen-nineties, the American Medical Association announced a product-endorsement agreement with the Sunbeam Corporation, a manufacturer of humidifiers, ice packs, heating pads, and the like. Amid an uproar, the A.M.A. backed out of the deal; Sunbeam sued for breach of contract and won a ten-million-dollar settlement. The American Heart Association, meanwhile, continues to rent out its name: a qualifying food manufacturer can get a heart-check-mark logo, signifying “criteria for heart-healthy meal” status, on its product’s package for an “administrative fee” of as much as six thousand dollars. The logo adorns thousands of low-fat items, such as Cheerios and various breads, which are not in any meaningful sense heart-healthy. For decades, as part of this program, the A.H.A. strongly promoted a low-fat diet, advocating the use of margarine instead of butter, the avoidance of eggs, and the limiting of saturated fats. As Nina Teicholz and Gary Taubes have shown, in their respective books “Big Fat Surprise” and “Why We Get Fat,” this endorsement, which was largely unsupported by data, helped fuel the obesity epidemic. (The A.H.A. has stood by its recommendations.) Recently, Ivor Benjamin, the president of the A.H.A., appeared onstage at an Apple special event, where he participated in the announcement of the newest Apple Watch, which features the ability to detect atrial fibrillation. Some cardiologists have raised concerns that this technology will create a wave of false alarms and unnecessary testing among people who are at low risk for heart-rhythm abnormalities. (Apple clarified to the Verge that the device is not meant to be a substitute for a proper EKG.) The American Academy of Family Physicians, similarly, has accepted a large donation from Coca-Cola to fund “consumer education content on beverages and sweeteners,” though the partnership ended in 2015. Sunscreen manufacturers once paid the American Academy of Dermatology for its endorsement, too, though that program is also defunct. Not all professional medical organizations are so self-interested. Recently, the Endocrine Society railed against the prices of insulin, which have been raised in lockstep by an oligopoly of three pharmaceutical manufacturers. (Between 2007 and 2017, the wholesale price of insulin tripled, a spike that has led a significant proportion of patients to ration their dosing; many have died.) The American Academy of Pediatrics has protested immigration policies that separate children from their parents. But such instances are unusual. And they are, on the whole, muted—confined to written communications in medical journals or position statements that are only sometimes announced at press conferences. Such organizations are ill-equipped to advocate for the larger interests of doctors or patients. It’s possible to imagine a new organization of doctors that has nothing to do with the business of medicine and everything to do with promoting the health of patients and adroitly confronting the transformational challenges that lie ahead for the medical profession. Such an organization wouldn’t be a trade guild protecting the interests of doctors. It would be a doctors’ organization devoted to patients. Its top priority might be restoring the human factor—the essence of medicine—which has slipped away, taking with it the patient-doctor relationship. It might oppose anti-vaxxers; challenge drug pricing and direct-to-consumer advertisements; denounce predatory, unregulated stem-cell clinics; promote awareness of the health hazards of climate change; and call out the false health claims for products advocated by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Mehmet Oz. This partial list provides a sense of how many momentous matters have been left unaddressed by the medical profession as a whole. Tackling any one of them would be hard; perhaps patient-advocacy groups could join in common cause. Such an organization could also address the profound changes that are on the horizon for the medical profession. In 2018, I had the privilege of leading a review of England’s National Health Service, focussing on the digital future of medicine. We investigated, among other things, the role that artificial intelligence could play in that future. Our economists projected that, for each minute of keyboard work that could be avoided by doctors, four hundred thousand hours would be freed up for patient interaction—the equivalent of hiring two hundred and thirty full-time physicians. Keyboard liberation is just one of the gifts of time that machine learning might provide: by synthesizing patient data, artificial intelligence could speed chart review; it could allow for automated diagnoses of common conditions such as urinary-tract infections, ear infections in children, or skin rashes; it could help patients self-manage high blood pressure or diabetes. All this outsourcing and off-loading could alleviate the burden on doctors and pave the way for a revitalized connection with patients. And yet it could also make medicine worse. Unfortunately, unlike teachers, lawyers, and other professionals, doctors are predominantly managed by businesspeople. Most medical administrators know very little about the time it takes to listen; to do a careful physical examination; to engender trust; to cultivate a deep relationship with a patient, each of whom has his or her own life story, pain, anxiety, and anguish. Over the last four decades, the number of health-care administrators in the United States has grown by thirty-two hundred per cent, while the number of doctors only increased by a hundred and fifty per cent. Several studies have found that outcomes for patients are better when health-care organizations are run by doctors instead of non-physician executives. Often, though, increases in productivity in health care have been used by managers and administrators to squeeze doctors, who are made to see more patients, read more scans, interpret more slides, and so on. Already, the emergence of machine learning has led some observers to proclaim that, in the future, hospitals will be able to do without radiologists, pathologists, and other medical specialists. That isn’t true—deep-learning algorithms have, at best, narrow capabilities—and yet it seems inevitable that managers will ignore medical realities in favor of the bottom line. Who will be in charge of our health as we move forward—doctors or their managers? The potential of A.I. to restore the human dimension in health care will depend on doctors stepping up to make their voices heard. Many would say that such an event is highly unlikely. Doctors organizing—it’s a crazy idea. The image of residents picketing in front of a hospital seems to hail from another world. Many people suspect that doctors suffer from a congenital inability to control their own destinies. Medical culture seems data-centric, conservative, heads-down, apolitical. And—surely—doctors are too busy. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that doctors can organize for the common good. There are numerous examples of medical activists who work in underserved communities, fighting against addiction, smoking, e-cigarettes, and guns. The challenge that lies ahead is building on these disconnected efforts. Fortunately, there’s a new generation of young doctors who are digital natives; they’re savvy with social media and recognize the power of such platforms to affect change. The increasing diversity of the medical profession is a hopeful sign. Many of the physician leaders who took on the N.R.A. are women: Esther Choo, an emergency-room doctor; Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist; Stephanie Bonne, a trauma surgeon; Jeannie Moorjani, a pediatrician. When the water in Flint, Michigan, was revealed to be saturated with toxic levels of lead, the leader of that exposé was Mona Hanna-Attisha, another pediatrician. Perhaps dealing with long-standing gender inequities in medicine has helped these doctors cultivate a willingness to stand up. We’ve all seen how the student survivors of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, have organized a national initiative, with marches, demonstrations, and active nationwide participation. If these resourceful, energized, impassioned teen-agers can organize a movement, shouldn’t doctors be capable of organizing, too? Because of the unique technological moment at which we live, we may not see an opportunity like this one for generations to come. We have a chance to affect the future of medicine; to advocate for patient interests; to restore the time doctors need to think, to listen, to establish trust, and build bonds, one encounter at a time. For these purposes, and in these times, an organization of all doctors is necessary. Rebuilding our relationships with our patients: that is our lane.

What the Democrats’ Turn Leftward Means for the Party’s Chances in 2020,15415,"Last week, twenty Democratic candidates for President debated in the course of two nights in Miami. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren appeared to bolster their campaigns, with Harris, in particular, making headlines for her criticism of Joe Biden’s past opposition to school busing. Later in the week, Harris explicitly announced that she supports a return of school busing to ease segregation in education. This followed all of the candidates at Thursday’s debate coming out in favor of government-funded health care for undocumented immigrants, Elizabeth Warren supporting the decriminalization of border crossings, and Harris initially seconding calls from Warren and Bernie Sanders for the abolition of private health insurance. (Harris claimed that she misunderstood the question; earlier this year, she appeared to take several different positions on the issue.) Joe Biden’s unsteady performance, meanwhile, weakened the candidacy of the Party’s highest-profile moderate. With President Trump and his team delighted by the Democrats’ leftward turn, a central question emerges: Will running on a more explicitly progressive platform energize the Democratic base, or will it cost the Party the 2020 election? To consider this question and others, I spoke by phone with Dave Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the Cook Political Report and a contributor to NBC News. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed whether voters are less ideological than people think they are, the ways in which the Electoral College presents a challenge to Democrats winning Presidential elections, and the true lesson of the 2018 midterms. Do you think Democrats whose primary desire is to see Trump defeated should be concerned or excited that their party seems to be moving leftward? I don’t think Democrats would be wise to run against Trump on a platform of completely open borders and abolishing private health insurance. There are limits. But, generally, the tiny sliver of voters in this country who are still persuadable are not highly ideological people. They are fundamentally anti-élite in nature, and they are looking for three characteristics in a candidate for President that don’t have much to do with left-versus-right. And those characteristics are authenticity, being a credible agent for change, and empathy. In other words, does this person understand my daily struggles? And a common thread between Obama and Trump was a common touch. It’s all relative, but, whether it was having been a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago or a billionaire who ate K.F.C. and went to professional wrestling matches, it struck a chord with those voters. Trump still got a lower percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney or John Kerry. Do you think there is a chance that we over-learn the lessons of a guy who got forty-six per cent? Yes, but Democrats shouldn’t under-learn the lessons of Hillary Clinton’s failure. She was viewed not as an Arkansas Democrat but as a Chappaqua Democrat, by 2016. She ran a campaign that didn’t just fail in terms of targeting the right states but failed to drive an economic message. And “stronger together” and “Trump is unfit for office” were not substitutes for “here’s my plan to get the American heartland back to work.” When you contrast Arkansas and Chappaqua, are you contrasting economics or culture? If you are arguing the latter, it seems like you could be arguing that “Massachusetts Democrat” could also be poisonous? It’s more cultural in my opinion, but there is no question that Clinton could have talked about the economy more. The pitfalls in a potential Harris or Warren nomination are several. But the first one that comes to mind is the reinforcement of an image that the Democratic Party is dominated by coastal élitists, and, despite Warren’s Oklahoma roots and populist message, her career as an Ivy League academic is a liability, or would be a serious liability in a general-election campaign. In Harris’s case, Republicans would love to run against San Francisco, but, more than that, she hasn’t woven voters’ personal stories into her case for why she should be elected as often as some other candidates have. And that is one area where she probably has room to grow as a candidate. It seems like you are saying freshness and authenticity are good, and we shouldn’t just be thinking about ideology, but there are various cultural markers which can be a problem, whether someone is centrist or left. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? That’s correct, in my view. At this point in 2015, there was a widespread notion that the Republican candidate who wanted to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it was unelectable in a general election. That proved to be false. And we should be careful about making broad pronouncements about platform positions such as Medicare for All or an overhaul of ice. O.K., but it seems to me that there is a fundamental difference, which is that no Democrat is capable of winning with forty-six per cent of the vote, because of the Electoral College map. That may be because the system is unfair, but it seems like you can make an argument that Republicans have more leeway in how they can run. That’s correct. The problem for Democrats is that they could still win five million more votes than Donald Trump and lose the Electoral College. The problem is that trends are benefitting Democrats in states that are not decisive in the Electoral College. Democrats are continuing to gain millions more votes in California. They could cut into Trump’s margin in Texas by eight hundred thousand and not be rewarded by a single electoral vote. Those trends are not as present in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. The question is: Can a more progressive candidate from a coastal state perform well in the middle of the country? And part of why Obama appealed in those [Midwestern] states was that he was a Midwestern candidate. He was someone who had experience going to fish fries in rural counties of Illinois, which, culturally and economically, are a lot like the parts of Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa where Democrats’ fortunes have fallen recently. So we shouldn’t assume we know how this will work—I certainly don’t—but the Democratic bar is simply higher. That’s correct. I believe too much of the media in Washington, D.C., is viewing candidates’ chances against Trump through a left-versus-right spectrum, or a sliding scale, in which if they nominate Biden they can win middle America, but if they nominate someone too far left they will risk alienating those voters. I don’t view it that way. The reason that, in my opinion, Biden is vulnerable—perhaps more vulnerable than other Democrats in the race [against] Trump—is that I have watched congressional races for the last twelve years, and, over and over again, I have seen candidates with long paper trails and voting records get picked apart for every comment they made twenty or thirty years ago. And that’s what is happening at the moment. The Biden people would probably say they are being picked apart for things that aren’t going to hurt him if he makes it to a general election, though, right? But here’s how they will: Democrats tend to underestimate the Trump campaign’s ability to weaponize social media to divide the Democratic base by attacking the eventual nominee from the left. Trump’s campaign, it’s no secret, is going to take to Facebook ads and other media to convince casual voters—in other words, voters who only turn out occasionally—that, for example, Joe Biden mistreated women, including Anita Hill; is a creep; opposed busing; and is, generally, a corporate Democrat. What lessons about Democratic electability do you draw from 2018? Is the best case for someone like Biden that turnout was huge in 2018, the highest in a century in a midterm, and so any Democrat, no matter how moderate, is likely to get a strong turnout? You can easily flip the coin and make the case that many Trump voters, particularly white men without college degrees, did not turn out in 2018 because Trump was not on the ballot. And there is real risk for Democrats that those voters are the largest drop-off universe from 2016 to 2018, and will return in 2020. So I am not convinced that 2018 signals a trend toward Democrats in 2020, especially because Trump has proven he is better than anyone else at incinerating his opponents’ images. So you don’t think Democrats should feel good about 2018 turnout? They should feel good about it, but 2018 was as much about subtraction as it was about addition. The number of young and nonwhite voters that cast ballots in 2018 was light-years ahead of 2014. But a lot of Democrats’ success had to do with Trump voters’ failure to turn out, which was almost a mirror image of Obama voters’ failure to turn out in 2010, and look how 2012 turned out. Can you explain that a little bit, given that over-all turnout was so high for a midterm? Look at it this way: Almost every Democrat who cast a ballot in 2018 also cast ballots in 2016. I am not sold on the proposition that 2018 indicates a surge in enthusiasm that’s meaningful for 2020. Part of why Democrats did well in 2018 was that they didn’t need one clear leader or one clear message. Their unifying figure was Donald Trump. In 2020, Democrats will have to settle on one choice. And right now I have a hard time seeing one candidate in this field who is capable of truly unifying the Democratic Party into battle. And, in fact, the Democratic field to me, so far, is more about quantity than quality. When you mentioned Democrats and the dangers of moving left, you brought up health care and immigration, which are two things some Democrats have moved left on. Are you saying that Democrats are going into territory they should be worried about ideologically? I have a hard time seeing Democrats running on totally open borders with Mexico or abolishing private health insurance and winning the general election. But it’s much more about the posture the nominee is willing to adopt. If, instead of responding defensively to Trump attack ads, the nominee immediately reclaims the offense and makes his or her case forcefully for why his or her plan should be adopted, then they will already be several steps ahead of where Hillary Clinton was in 2016. The people Democrats need to be very concerned about turning out are the young and nonwhite demographics that did not show up for Hillary Clinton in 2016. A candidate like Stacey Abrams, who is younger and nonwhite and not from a bastion regarded as élite and liberal, would have a better chance of turning those voters out than a seventy-eight-year-old white guy who has been in office for most of his life. Would the case against what you were saying about Biden and Abrams be that swing voters in the Midwest, specifically, would find Biden more appealing? My rejoinder to that would be that the idea that Joe Biden could return a lot of those white working-class voters to the Democratic fold could turn out to be a mirage. These voters have become culturally loyal to Trump. They are much likelier to live in places where local news is declining—in other words, places that are more susceptible to aggressive social-media propaganda campaigns. Trump’s popularity has not waned much in those places. Would your argument in this conversation imply that you disagree with someone like Nate Silver, who argued that Clinton probably would have won the election, perhaps by five or six points nationally, if not for the Comey letter? Because, if you believe that, even with a candidate like Clinton, who is far from perfect, her loss may have been more of a fluke, and so you might want to go with what is perceived as a safe choice. In an election decided essentially by seventy-eight thousand votes in three states, just about anything makes a difference. But what I think 2016 proved was that doubling down on the evolution of your party and its base can pay dividends. We saw in 2012 that Mitt Romney, who represented the last vestiges of the country-club wing of the Republican Party, simply could not excite the voters that Trump could excite in 2016. I see the same potential scenario on the Democratic side, where Joe Biden might be the last vestige of a certain kind of Democratic Party that failed to excite the future of the Democratic Party. But Romney got more votes than Trump. That’s not true. Sorry, he got a higher percentage, but not more votes. So it seems like this is about the Electoral College. He excited different people than Trump did, but the ones Trump excited counted more in the Electoral College. So it seems like the argument may be different for Democrats, because they don’t have that advantage. It’s all about which states candidates are over- or underperforming in. It may not be fair, but the reality is that Democrats need to win places like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to beat Donald Trump in 2020. They may nominate a candidate who is really popular in California or Texas. [But], yeah, there is a higher bar for Democrats here. No doubt about that. Trump was good at motivating a certain type of person, and it seems unclear what that means for Democrats. We tend to think of those states as dominated by white working-class voters, and they are. But that element of the electorate doesn’t fully explain what happened in 2016. But there was also a decline in African-American participation in those states versus 2012, and that is another key to 2020. The six states that I argue will decide the race are those three, plus Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina. If I had to narrow it down to the two states I think will be absolutely most decisive, I would say Arizona and Wisconsin. But what five of the six have in common are pretty robust African-American populations. And if I wanted to know the turnout rate for one demographic in 2020 for the sake of predicting the result, it would be African-American voters under forty. My summary of everything you have said today is that I don’t think it will necessarily make Democrats feel good, and Michelle Obama is the clear answer. If Michelle Obama were remotely interested in running, which, after reading her book, seems about as likely as me winning the Tour de France next year, she would have a better chance to win than just about anyone in the field.

The White House’s New Budget Exposes Donald Trump’s Lies About Protecting Medicare and Medicaid,6354,"I’ve noted before that Donald Trump lives by a famous dictum from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist: “When one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it.” (Goebbels attributed this tactic to the English.) And the President has outdone himself with his Administration’s new budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year, which is entitled “A Budget for a Better America: Promises Kept. Taxpayers First.” “Promises kept” has a particularly nice ring to it. Almost as nice as what Trump said on that fateful day, June 16, 2015, when he descended the escalator at Trump Tower. “Save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts,” he declared. “Have to do it.” Throughout the Republican primary campaign, Trump repeated this pledge many times and also accused his G.O.P. opponents of wanting to slash the three big entitlement programs. In the general-election campaign, he stuck to the same mantra. A few days before Election Day, he suggested that Hillary Clinton wanted to “destroy” Medicare, the public health-care system for the elderly, which she had vowed to expand, and claimed that he alone would “protect” it. So how does the “Budget for a Better America” treat Medicare and the other programs that Trump vowed to safeguard at all costs? By calling for even larger cuts to them than the White House proposed this time last year, when it formally abandoned Trump’s campaign pledges. The budget for the 2019 fiscal year called for five hundred and fifty billion dollars in cuts to Medicare over ten years. With the budget deficit skyrocketing as a consequence of the Trump-G.O.P. tax bill, the 2020 budget would reduce spending on Medicare by eight hundred and forty-five billion dollars over the next decade. Even in Washington, that’s a lot of money. The cuts to Medicare would be imposed as the budget allots billions of dollars a year in extra spending to the Pentagon and another $8.6 billion for Trump’s wall along the southern border. The economies would be achieved largely by reducing payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers, which could affect benefits and drive some providers to leave the program. Rather than spelling this out, the document adopts the language of Newspeak: “The Budget proposes to reduce wasteful spending and incentivize efficiency and quality of healthcare in Medicare, extending the solvency of the program for America’s seniors consistent with the President’s promise to protect Medicare.” The budget treats Medicaid, the federal health program for poor people and children, in even more draconian fashion. Reflecting a long-standing priority of the Republican Party, the budget would convert Medicaid into a decentralized system administered by the states and financed by federal block grants. By indexing these grants to the rate of consumer-price inflation, which rises more slowly than inflation in the health-care sector, the budget would substantially reduce the federal spending commitment going forward. In addition, it would eliminate funding that the Affordable Care Act provided for individual states to expand Medicaid to more recipients—funding that more than thirty states have taken advantage of in recent years. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Even for an ardently conservative Administration like this one, you might think that would be enough cuts to health-care spending. No. The budget also proposes to eliminate some federal subsidies that the A.C.A. provided for the purchase of private insurance plans by people who aren’t quite poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. “The budget overall would cut funding for Medicaid and ACA subsidies by $777 billion over ten years, compared to current law,” Hannah Katch, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, noted. It is true that, these days, White House budgets often don’t amount to much. Effectively, they are extended wish lists, which the spending authorities on Capitol Hill often set aside, especially when the government is divided, as it is now. But even a White House wish list is a significant document, because it expresses the spending priorities of the Administration and the President. In this instance, those priorities run directly counter to the message that Trump conveyed on the campaign trail. No surprise there, you might say. It’s been clear from the beginning that Trump was selling snake oil and that his pledge to protect the safety net was about as valuable as a certificate from Trump University. But it is instructive, nonetheless, to see his mendacity expressed in cold numbers, and it also raises an interesting political question. What will Trump do when the 2020 campaign heats up and the Democratic candidates hurl back at him the details of his spending proposals? On Monday, some Democrats were already doing this. Bernie Sanders tweeted, “This budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people.” Kamala Harris tweeted, “This would hurt our seniors and is yet another piece of evidence for why we need a new president.” My guess is that Trump might well end up disowning his own handiwork. Budgets? I had nothing to with them. I was too busy building the wall and hanging out with Little Rocket Man. Hopefully, the Democrats (and the voters) won’t let him get away with it.

The 2020 Presidential Hopefuls and the Politics of Consensus,12808,"Beto O’Rourke, the latest candidate to enter the 2020 race, toured the small eateries of Iowa earlier this month, climbing onto coffee counters and bars to deliver his message of uplift. Last Friday, he towered over an audience at a restaurant in Mount Vernon, Iowa. “I’m encouraged, I’m energized,” he said, with a few swings of his left arm. “Because I know that all of us, regardless of our geography, regardless of our race, regardless of any other difference that might otherwise define us and divide us, are going to come together at this moment of truth.” On “The Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon played him as if “your friend’s hot dad had the energy of a golden retriever,” but BuzzFeed’s Molly Hensley-Clancy posted a dispatch that suggests O’Rourke was well received by Iowa voters. “I want reconciliation, and he brings that to my heart,” a woman named Anne Phillips told her. “I sense in him that he can bring us back together.” O’Rourke—a moderate who raised his national profile on a live-streamed road trip with a Republican colleague—has staked much of his career on creating that feeling. His unwillingness to outline much of a policy agenda has vexed progressives and journalists alike. Hensley-Clancy wrote, “It took several different reporters, and several different campaign stops to pin down something approximating O’Rourke’s stance on health care.” (He eventually responded that he supports a Medicare buy-in.) O’Rourke joins a field of candidates who have spent the past two years loudly taking stands on the proposals that will define the primary and the election beyond. Most of the major candidates have moved left, converging on ideas like Medicare for All. Some, like O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, and Joe Biden, should he enter the race, want to stay planted near the Party’s center. The policy debates and jostling between the Democratic Party’s competing factions—a recent FiveThirtyEight piece identified six distinct wings—are sure to continue. But whatever the policy differences between the contenders, there is a firm consensus, within the Democratic Party, on the politics of consensus. As Cory Booker, the candidate of “radical love,” has put it, “The larger call is not just how we beat Republicans but how you unite all Americans in the cause of our country.” Or as Klobuchar, who is running on her popularity in moderate Minnesota, has said, “I am someone who’s always looked for that common ground, and I believe we need to cross this river of our divide over the sturdy bridge that is our democracy.” Beyond uniting America, the more immediate challenge for the next Democratic President will be overcoming some difficult math. Democrats currently hold forty-five seats in the Senate. It would take a gain of fifteen seats—in an election year dominated by red-state contests—to reach the sixty votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. The last election to deliver a change of more than ten Senate seats occurred nearly forty years ago, when Republicans took twelve seats upon Ronald Reagan’s election, in 1980. Outdoing it in 2020 would require Democrats to run the table in places like Tennessee and Nebraska. Democrats will almost certainly fall short, and when they do, the chances of Republicans lending a hand to pass policies like Medicare for All or a Green New Deal are, of course, even slimmer. And the experiences of the Obama Administration should disabuse Democrats of the notion that more moderate proposals would fare any better. “Barack Obama rolls into office with Mitt Romney’s health-care policy, with John McCain’s climate policy, with Bill Clinton’s tax policy, and George H. W. Bush’s foreign policy,” the former Clinton economist Brad DeLong told Vox earlier this month. “And did George H. W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, did John McCain say a single good word about anything Barack Obama ever did over the course of eight solid years? No, they fucking did not.” The next Democratic President with a Democratic Congress will thus have exactly one option available for the passage of most of the major proposals being advanced by the 2020 candidates: urging the Democratic Senate Majority Leader to eliminate the filibuster in order to pass legislation by simple majority vote. Exactly two candidates—Washington governor Jay Inslee and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg—have explicitly endorsed this idea. Both are long shots. Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all said straightforwardly that they would like to keep the filibuster. When asked about the filibuster on the podcast “Pod Save America,” in January, Gillibrand argued that reaching sixty votes in the Senate would be indicative of broad public support for the policy in question. ”[I]f you don’t have sixty votes yet,” she said, “it just means you haven’t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media In fact, there is already broad support for the most ambitious ideas being offered by Democrats this election. Fifty-six per cent of Americans support Medicare for All while seventy-four per cent support a Medicare buy-in. More than eighty per cent of Americans support the provisions of the Green New Deal. None of these proposals is likely to receive sixty Senate votes in the next Congress. The problem isn’t a lack of public support but a set of structural obstacles, including the design of the Senate, that have contributed to what the Columbia law professor Tim Wu calls the “oppression of the supermajority.” The American political divide rests not between the two halves of a deeply divided public but, rather, between a significant majority of the American population and a conservative minority that is both disproportionately empowered by our political institutions and incorrigibly opposed to Democratic policies. This is an existential challenge for the Democratic Party and American democracy. No sunny homily delivered from atop a dining table is going to make it go away. But the candidates bear only part of the blame for our inability to face the problem squarely. They are, after all, just telling Democratic voters what they want to hear. Polls have long shown that Democrats value political comity and compromise more than Republicans. A Pew survey last year found, too, that seventy-nine per cent of Democrats believe, like seventy-eight per cent of voters over all, that it is very important for the country that Democrats and Republicans “work together on issues.” If the rise of Donald Trump has failed to dislodge that aspiration, it’s unclear what would. For years, a certain class of pundits has got its jollies scolding voters for both supporting a variety of expensive policies and opposing the broad tax increases that might be advanced to finance them. Fewer take aim at another, equally stark contradiction: the public’s support for both highly partisan policy ideas and the norm of bipartisan compromise in Washington. Perhaps the clearest illustration in recent memory of how lowly we’ve prostrated ourselves in the hopes of national reconciliation came last week, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post that she does not support impeaching President Trump. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” she said. It would seem that bipartisanship and conciliation have at last supplanted an older, fustier norm: the rule of law. In 1960, bipartisanship was held in low enough esteem that the historian Henry Graff could say, in the Times, that “in domestic matters, bipartisanship is, naturally, impossible and undesirable.” In recent decades, bipartisanship has had an ignominous record. Though there were moments of unity during the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations, little of what we achieved in them—welfare reform, the 1994 crime bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, the Iraq War—is being embraced by 2020 candidates. And yet, promises of unity have become important rites of the American civil religion. Few Presidents did more to make that so than Barack Obama, who launched his political career urging reconciliation between blue states and red states, even as political polarization, exacerbated by his election in 2008, effectively brought to a close the era of bipartisan action on major domestic-policy issues. At the outset, Obama framed the obstacles to that kind of consensus-building as nefarious external forces. ”[E]ven as we speak,” he warned in his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, “there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.” Trump, a more perfect embodiment of the politics of anything goes than Obama could have possibly imagined, fits snugly into that rhetorical template. “Trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin, our country of origin, our gender, our religion and our sexual orientation,” Bernie Sanders tweeted earlier this month. “We are going to do exactly the opposite.” But in a sense, Donald Trump has actually united the country—he is the most unpopular President in this stage of his term of the past sixty years. The vast majority reviles and distrusts him. A minority adores him in part, no doubt, because dirty tricksters, including the President himself, have worked hard to mislead them and sow division. But Trump’s supporters also seem to genuinely share Trump’s notions about what America is and who ought to be considered a part of it. In truth, we should name in our national cast of spin masters not only those who work to divide Americans but also those who imply that our divisions would dissipate as a consequence of an election. For all the policy debates now taking place, the 2020 Democrats, on these matters, have been deeply unserious. We know next to nothing about how they intend to lead and implement their agendas—only that they might have the audacity to hope they can succeed as healers and inspirational figures, precisely where Obama, whose gifts as a communicator vastly exceed those of anyone running, often failed. This is a considerably more fanciful notion than establishing a national health-insurance system or transitioning America to a clean-energy economy. Obama himself harbors no illusions about the nature of the obstacles his Presidency faced. “The big challenge that we faced was the filibuster,” he told David Axelrod in November. “Adding the filibuster, I think, has made it almost impossible for us to effectively govern at a time when you have at least one party that is not willing to compromise on issues.” Candidates are now being asked about the filibuster with some regularity. But at some point, perhaps at one of the primary debates this year, they should also be asked a much broader question. A less fractious America would obviously be a better one. But in the event that you cannot, actually, bring us together—if a defeated Trump continues to hold sway among the Republican base and your Republican colleagues, if the Republican Party continues to demonize Muslims, and immigrants, and transgender people, or accuses you of supporting infanticide, or attributes your success to mass fraud or the machinations of a Jewish banker, if, in short, the election of another African-American, or a woman, or a socialist, or even a liberal, has the effect not of lessening political divides but of deepening them severely—how, exactly, do you intend to govern this country?

The Jail Health-Care Crisis,46876,"As a child growing up in Pueblo, Colorado, Jeremy Laintz travelled widely with his father, an aeronautics engineer at Lockheed Martin, who sometimes took his four kids along on business trips. Family vacations included tours of aerospace facilities and, on one occasion, a trip to watch a space-shuttle launch at Cape Canaveral. Laintz’s mother managed a bakery, and Laintz, the youngest child in the family, recalled enjoying a warm home life. He played soccer and football, and spent summers hunting and fishing on a ranch that his family owned in North Dakota. As a teen-ager, though, he slipped into trouble—he was arrested first for driving under the influence, and then, in his late teens, for felony car theft. He spent a year in prison, where he learned to weld, and a few more years in halfway houses. Then, in 2003, he moved to Alaska, where he joined a Christian fellowship and took seasonal jobs welding, repairing roofs, and working in a fish-processing plant. He often made good money, and his life seemed back on track. Six years later, though, when he was thirty, he returned to Colorado and, while working in a warehouse, tore a tendon in his wrist. A doctor prescribed opioids for the pain, and Laintz immediately started abusing them. Then a friend persuaded him to try heroin, and soon he was addicted. He was arrested on a charge of possession and, while out on bond, in early October of 2016, failed to show up for a court-ordered drug test. He was arrested again and booked into the Pueblo County jail. As part of the standard booking procedure, medical personnel at the jail evaluated him. Pueblo County had a contract with Correctional Health Partners, a doctor-owned, for-profit company based in Denver, to provide health services; there was a medical facility on site, supplied with basic equipment. Laintz told company nurses on duty that he used heroin and suffered from hepatitis C, an affliction common among intravenous drug users. Correctional Health staff prescribed loperamide (for diarrhea) and meclizine (for nausea and vomiting) to ease his withdrawal while he awaited sentencing, a lawyer representing Laintz said. A week later, though, according to filings in a recent lawsuit, Laintz submitted a written request for medical help, noting that he was experiencing a level of pain “so bad I don’t know what is going on,” and that he could “hardly breathe” and “hardly move.” A Correctional Health E.M.T. gave him over-the-counter medication for “possible chest pain or anxiety/panic attack.” On October 15th, a Saturday, when his mother visited, Laintz complained to her, too, of severe pain. The following Thursday, he was sentenced to ninety days in jail. When his mother returned, a week later, he told her that he was still in “rough shape,” so she called the Correctional Health unit. His father also went to speak to the county sheriff, who oversaw the jail. A physician’s assistant examined Laintz again, and found that he had low blood pressure and an elevated pulse. According to court documents, she told him to try “relaxation and breath control.” After he told deputies that he was too weak to walk to the dining hall, they allowed other inmates to bring him food in his cell. On November 1st, an administrator at Correctional Health left a voice-mail message for Laintz’s mother reporting that, according to the medical staff, “everything is pretty much normal.” He suggested that Laintz had been deliberately hyperventilating to produce his symptoms, in an attempt to be sent to the hospital. “There is no medical reason for him to go,” the administrator said, and asked her to tell her son “to quit hyperventilating and to coöperate with us.” That evening, however, a sheriff’s deputy noticed that Laintz looked pale and was having difficulty breathing. The deputy declared an emergency, but, rather than send him to a hospital, a Correctional Health physician’s assistant ordered treatment with intravenous fluids in the jail’s medical facility. When Laintz insisted on being taken to the hospital, a sergeant at the jail overruled the assistant and sent Laintz in a police car to the St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center. There, according to his lawyer, doctors diagnosed dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and acute renal and respiratory failure. They put him in a medically induced coma and intubated him, then had him airlifted to a hospital near Denver, where he spent a month undergoing multiple procedures, including the partial removal of a lung. He also lost part of six toes to gangrene. Laintz is suing the county and Correctional Health Partners for “deliberately indifferent policies.” The county declined to comment on pending litigation. In a court filing on February 12th, Correctional Health disputed Laintz’s account, saying that “at no time” did its personnel fail to “address and treat his medical needs.” Madison Barr, a spokeswoman for the company, had previously told me that she also could not comment on the lawsuit, but she pointed out that increasing numbers of people are entering jails with medical problems related to chronic conditions, such as addiction, and that, at the time of their booking, “these conditions don’t necessarily show symptoms.” There are more than three thousand jails in the United States, usually run by sheriffs and county offices, which house some seven hundred thousand people. They are typically waiting to make bail—or, if they can’t, to go to trial or enter a plea—or are serving short sentences. Barr is right about the crisis of chronic health conditions among them. According to a study released in 2017 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly half the people held in jails suffer from some kind of mental illness, and more than a quarter have a severe condition, such as bipolar disorder. The same year, the bureau reported that about two-thirds of sentenced jail inmates suffer from drug addiction or dependency; that number was based on data from 2007-09, so it does not take into account the recent catastrophic rise of opioid addiction. That epidemic and other public-health emergencies, in jails across the country, are being aggravated by failings in the criminal-justice system. Jails have a much higher turnover rate than prisons, where inmates generally serve long sentences. Prison wardens face their own problems, serving populations that suffer from chronic diseases and conditions related to aging, in addition to high rates of addiction and mental illness. Yet the crisis is particularly acute in jails, because large numbers of people booked into custody are in a state of distress or, like Laintz, will suffer withdrawal, which can require close monitoring and specialized treatment that jail wardens are not equipped to provide. Many jails are in rural or poor counties, where administrators complain that they have neither the resources nor the expertise to hire, train, and supervise doctors and nurses in the particular demands that their facilities require. Increasingly, they have turned to for-profit companies operating in the field known as “correctional health care,” which pledge to deliver quality care while containing costs. The growth of for-profit firms providing medical services to the incarcerated is part of a trend that started in the nineteen-eighties, during the Reagan Administration, toward privatization in the general management of correctional facilities. The trend accelerated after the passage of tough sentencing laws in the nineties—notably the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994—which caused the number of people held in jails and prisons to jump from about three hundred thousand, in 1980, to more than two million today. More than a third of that population is African-American. According to a 2018 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than half the states hire private companies to provide at least some of their prison health care. There are no comprehensive statistics about the prevalence of private health-care companies in jails. But, according to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which accredits programs in correctional facilities around the country, about seventy per cent of the jails that it inspects outsource their medical services, and for-profit companies have a sizable share of those contracts. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   People held in correctional facilities are entitled to a judicially mandated standard of care, but no large-scale studies have been conducted to compare the quality of treatment provided by private companies with that provided by government-run services. The evidence available from lawsuits filed against the companies is troubling, however. With the help of Gabrialle Landsverk and Alejandra Ibarra Chaoul, postgraduate researchers at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, I reviewed complaints, depositions, and affidavits in lawsuits filed against jail operators and correctional-health-care companies. We focussed on two of the largest nationwide providers, Corizon Health, which is based in Brentwood, Tennessee, and Wellpath, which is headquartered in Nashville. The two companies have been sued about fifteen hundred times during the past five years—according to the federal and state court records that we collected—over matters including alleged neglect, malpractice, and, in dozens of cases, wrongful injury or death. (Corizon was the defendant in more than a thousand of the cases.) Most of the suits were filed pro se, or without the help of a lawyer; petitioners had legal counsel in only about a quarter of them. More than a hundred ended in settlements, but, owing to confidentiality agreements, it is often not clear whether the company or the local government made a payment, or, if so, for how much. Corizon reports that it is responsible for the care of about a hundred and eighty thousand people on a day-to-day basis. Wellpath, which until last November was known as Correct Care Solutions (the company changed its name after merging with a competitor), says that it is responsible for about two hundred and fifty thousand people on any given day. Executives from both companies told me that the lawsuits shouldn’t be seen as indicative of over-all problems with how they treat patients. Many cases involve flimsy or inconclusive evidence and don’t result in findings of liability. Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a prison-health-care consultant based in San Francisco, who advises state and local governments on providing medical services to prisoners, said that, for the companies, managing suits alleging poor treatment is “just a cost of doing business in this industry.” Patrick Cummiskey, Wellpath’s chief strategy officer, told me that the company is concerned, above all, with maintaining good health among inmates, and that it believes that providing quality care will reduce its financial risks in the long run. He also pointed out that Wellpath routinely indemnifies state and local governments from all legal costs in cases involving alleged medical mistakes. “We bear the risk of malpractice,” he said, so “we’re incentivized to provide quality care.” In some states, though, public-interest lawyers have brought class-action suits alleging inadequate health care against the entire system. In Arizona, civil-rights groups filed a class-action suit in 2012. A year later, after the state passed legislation privatizing prison health care, it signed a contract with Corizon to provide medical services in its prisons. In 2015, a federal district court, seeking to resolve the suit, approved a settlement in which the state pledged to overhaul care. But, last June, Judge David Duncan found that “widespread and systemic failures remain,” and held the state in contempt, issuing it fines of more than a million dollars. Martha Harbin, who has served as Corizon’s director of external relations, said in an e-mail that the company does “not agree with the judge’s description” of its performance in Arizona. Last month, the state, which has also disputed the judge’s finding, announced that, as of July, it is awarding the contract to another company. In December, in a case in which a federal judge is supervising a settlement designed to improve medical services at Baltimore’s city jail, the State of Maryland, which oversees the facility, said in court documents that Wexford Health Sources, the company it hired to provide the services, had failed to respond to directions to improve its performance. It had allegedly provided “unreliable” reports, and operated while “critically short of care providers and clerical staff,” leaving “key clinical and leadership positions vacant for lengthy periods.” Wexford lost the contract, though it is not a party to the litigation, and a spokesperson for the company said that it and the state “had a difference in opinion” about how to best provide health care to inmates. Taken as a whole, evidence from cases across the country suggests that four decades of policy failures in both health-care and criminal-justice reform have left a largely neglected population vulnerable and, at times, at risk, and that for-profit companies, which were promoted as a solution, have instead become an integral part of a troubled system. The standard of care that incarcerated people have a right to receive was established in the landmark case of Estelle v. Gamble, in 1976. J. W. Gamble was an inmate in the Huntsville Unit of the Texas prison system. On November 9, 1973, a six-hundred-pound bale of cotton fell on him while he was on work assignment in a textile mill. He complained repeatedly of severe back pain, and prison doctors gave him pain relievers, but they did not take any X-rays. After refusing to work, he was moved to solitary confinement. He filed a pro-se lawsuit, in the form of a twenty-four-page handwritten complaint, objecting to the quality of medical care he had received. A federal judge dismissed the suit, but Gamble appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which appointed Daniel K. Hedges, a corporate litigator in Houston, to represent him. Hedges never met his client, but he argued that Gamble’s treatment was unconstitutional, because of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, where Hedges again argued it. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for an eight-to-one majority, found that “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” was indeed inconsistent with Eighth Amendment guarantees, and ordered that Gamble’s care be reëvaluated. Gamble himself did not benefit from the ruling: after his case was returned to the Fifth Circuit, the appellate court found that his care had not been sufficiently poor to justify compensation. (A few years later, he was killed by a fellow-prisoner.) Still, practitioners of prison medicine today like to point out that, thanks to Gamble’s suit and Marshall’s opinion, the incarcerated are the only people in America with a constitutional right to health care. The Estelle decision was handed down just as the American Medical Association was leading a drive to reform health care for the incarcerated. It conducted a survey of conditions in hundreds of jails, in which operators reported dilapidated and ill-equipped facilities. Many lacked emergency medical equipment. Some didn’t even have first-aid kits. The standard of care set by Estelle was modest, calling only for an absence of “deliberate indifference.” But, building on the decision, the A.M.A. sought to establish uniform standards, which, in turn, led to the creation, in 1983, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. Estelle also spawned a wave of civil-rights litigation seeking to enforce the Eighth Amendment protection; this gradually led to improvements in the judiciary’s definition of a required standard. Today, prisoners are typically entitled to what a judge for the First Circuit Court of Appeals defined, in 1987, as “adequate” care at a level “reasonably commensurate with modern medical science.” (The irony remains that inmates’ rights to health care have expanded, while citizens on the outside still have no universal right to care.) Litigation, though, is not always the best way to improve public policy. David Cloud, who works on prison-health-care issues for the Vera Institute, a nonprofit research group that focusses on criminal justice, told me, “I definitely don’t want to discount the importance of litigation, because it’s so critical.” Still, he added, correctional health care is more than an arena that requires legal accountability when failures occur. Its troubles affect many people beyond those who are incarcerated. Jails may hire private companies in the interest of saving taxpayer dollars. But, if people suffering from addiction or chronic illness are released back into communities without having received adequate treatment, “they’re still going to draw on taxpayers—just somewhere else.” Companies that contract to provide health care to the incarcerated are tapping into an enormous business opportunity—annual spending now exceeds ten billion dollars—and they are obligated to their owners to seek profit. David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project, at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me that companies therefore have compelling incentives to cut costs and staff, which can result in “denying care in what is literally a captive market.” He added, “I don’t mean to suggest that government-run prison health care is perfect. It’s often appallingly deficient. But, at least when a government is providing the service, there is some measure of oversight. There is some measure of democratic control.” Apart from the court-enforced standards that have evolved since Estelle, “you don’t have that with the private companies.” Day to day, correctional-care companies treat people on site for complaints like headaches and minor injuries. Nurses wheel carts through cellblocks to dispense over-the-counter and prescription medications; people who are sick can either call out for help or submit written requests. Nurses, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and administrators typically staff jail infirmaries around the clock. In larger, urban jails, doctors, psychiatrists, and social workers may also work on site. In rural counties, they appear perhaps once or twice a week for consultations. When no doctor is present, one is usually on call to consult by telephone in emergencies. In situations requiring surgery or other complex procedures, correctional-care companies are supposed to send patients to a hospital. The companies negotiate multiyear contracts with each jail and prison that they serve. Medical staff, prescription drugs, and outside services such as hospital stays constitute the major costs. Often, the companies receive a per-diem, per-individual rate, so profits depend on holding costs below that amount. Sometimes contracts include provisions that increase a company’s potential profit if it holds down transfers to hospitals or to other outside providers. Medicare and private health-insurance companies follow similar incentives to contain costs, prioritize preventive care, and avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. But a distinct feature of correctional health care is that, if incarcerated people believe that their health—or their life—is in jeopardy, they can’t just drive themselves to an emergency room. As Fathi put it, “Market forces don’t operate in the prison context for the reason that prisoners have absolutely no consumer choice.” The potential effects that contract incentives might have on health care have featured in a number of lawsuits in recent years. One case involved a forty-four-year-old man named Kenneth McGill, who was booked into the jail in Jefferson County, Colorado, after violating probation for a D.U.I. conviction. He had been there two months when, in September of 2012, he began to experience facial drooping and dizziness—symptoms, he thought, of a stroke. He and other inmates reported his symptoms to the deputies on duty and to a nurse with Correctional Healthcare Companies, which had a contract to provide medical services at the jail. (The company has no connection to Correctional Health Partners; in 2014, it was acquired by Correct Care Solutions, the company that became Wellpath.) According to court documents, company staff waited more than twelve hours before sending McGill to a hospital. Doctors there determined that he had had a stroke—he says that he still suffers from vertigo and from a loss of mobility in his right arm—and he sued the company. Anna Holland Edwards, one of McGill’s attorneys, told me that, at the trial, she and her colleagues pointed to a provision in Correctional Healthcare’s contract which stipulated that the company had to pay the first fifty thousand dollars in costs when an inmate went to the hospital. “There’s nothing wrong with being a for-profit company,” she said in her closing argument. “But the intersection of profit and health care has its problems.” She continued, “The company gets to decide whether the care is provided and know that they’re the ones that have to pay for it when it is.” (A spokesperson for the county later disputed that its contract with Correctional Healthcare discouraged hospitalization.) The jury awarded McGill eleven million dollars, including more than seven million in punitive damages against Correctional Healthcare. The parties then settled for an undisclosed amount. David Perry, Wellpath’s chief legal officer, said that Correctional Healthcare’s “way of doing things was different in some respects from ours.” But he also argued that provisions requiring companies to pay for off-site costs, though common, don’t encourage cost-cutting, because, if a company fails to provide quality services, “eventually your clients will hold you accountable for it.” Martha Harbin, of Corizon Health, told me that maximizing on-site care “respects the taxpayer dollars used to pay for correctional health care,” and reduces the risk of people escaping from hospitals. (Escapes from hospitals are, in fact, a recurring problem.) But, she said, “we don’t hesitate to send people off site if the evidence points to that need. If they have to go, they have to go.” Many of the nurses and doctors I spoke with who work in jails described their careers as a moral calling. They serve people on the margins of society: it is not unusual for them to encounter patients who haven’t visited a doctor in years. Ned Higgins, a psychiatrist in South Carolina who has worked on contract for Wellpath, told me that he finds working in county jails inspirational. “We’re helping the seriously mentally ill,” he said. “The vast majority of inmates, patients, that I see were off their medicine when they got arrested. I see our mission as to get them back on their medicine and get them off street drugs. I think we do that very well.” Specialists in the field agree. “People really are trying to provide high-quality health care, and jail environments are really tough,” Brent Gibson, a physician who is the chief health officer of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said. “Nobody wants a bad health-care outcome.” Still, a significant amount of the serious neglect documented in lawsuits arises from the fact that jails have become a primary provider of medical care for the severely mentally ill. Rhonda Levand was confronted with the sometimes harsh consequences of that reality in the case of her daughter, Raynbow Gignilliat. In 1992, when Gignilliat was seventeen and in her junior year of high school, in Marietta, Georgia, she was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Eventually, she graduated from college, got married, had three sons, and worked as a paralegal, a substitute teacher, and a freelance writer. She didn’t always take her medications, Levand told me, and “every year she would go through a little cycle where she was a little bit manic.” But then she would right herself. In 2013, Gignilliat and her husband divorced, which seemed to trigger a new crisis for her and led to a number of short hospital stays. Levand by then was living near Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she now works as a paraprofessional special-education teacher and a receptionist. That October, she invited her daughter to stay with her. Gignilliat had never been violent with her before, Levand said, but on October 27th she started “pushing and shoving” her, and upending furniture and breaking things in the house. Levand called the police, and Gignilliat was arrested for aggravated battery and property damage, and was taken to the Sandoval County Detention Center. The health services at the jail were provided by Correctional Healthcare, the company that was later acquired by Wellpath. Medical staff noted that Gignilliat had mental-health needs, but she refused to take medication. “If they don’t consent to take the medicine, they don’t force them,” Levand told me. In fact, neither the company nor the jail had legal authority to do so; in New Mexico, such action requires state-court approval. Medical or jail staff could have petitioned a judge to name a “treatment guardian” for Gignilliat, but did not. Levand could have petitioned, too, but says she didn’t know that this was an option. After a social worker referred Gignilliat to a physician’s assistant for psychiatric evaluation, corrections officers placed her in a segregated cell, according to a legal complaint. She was allowed to leave it only to take a shower or to consult with a social worker or with medical staff; some days, she refused a shower and did not leave her cell at all. By mid-December, she had become deeply delusional, and the warden finally transferred her to the emergency room at the University of New Mexico Hospital. A doctor there diagnosed bipolar disorder and psychosis, treated her with anti-anxiety medication, and persuaded her to eat—according to Levand, she had lost about twenty pounds. She was then sent back to jail, where she again went unmedicated. Two weeks later, Gignilliat was transferred to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute. Staff there obtained a court-appointed treatment guardianship, and, in late January of 2014, she was administered medication, and her condition stabilized. At the end of March, the district attorney dropped the criminal charges against her, and she went back to Georgia. Photographs taken there show her smiling as she embraces her children. Yet, on June 12th, she swallowed a fatal dose of pills; she died two days later, at the age of thirty-nine. The next month, Levand filed suit on behalf of Gignilliat’s children. Sandoval County and Wellpath, which inherited the liabilities in the case from Correctional Healthcare, said that, since Gignilliat’s suicide took place more than two months after she was released, they bore no responsibility. However, court papers filed by Levand describe starkly the daily suffering that her daughter endured while in segregation. Ultimately, the county and the company agreed to a confidential financial settlement. David Perry said that Wellpath rarely pursues jury trials, because “it is very expensive to litigate cases, notwithstanding how justified you believe your position to be.” The situation that Gignilliat encountered is not uncommon: few local jails have dedicated mental-health facilities, and operators often resort to managing people by placing them in segregation. Yet even in jails that do provide dedicated care the quality can be poor. In the summer of 2013, Bradley Ballard was detained in New York City’s jail on Rikers Island for a parole violation. He was thirty-nine years old and suffered from diabetes, but he had previously received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and was assigned to the mental-health unit. Under a contract signed with the city in 2001, Corizon Health shared responsibility for medical services at Rikers and oversaw the mental-health facility. In September, according to a legal complaint, Ballard was moved to solitary confinement, after dancing provocatively in front of a female corrections officer. For six days, medical personnel and jail guards looked in on him, but did not offer him any assistance. He was then discovered lying naked and covered in his own waste. He had mutilated his genitals, and died hours after being found, from sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis. In 2014, civil-rights lawyers filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ballard’s mother and his estate. The New York State Commission of Correction, in reviewing the case, said that the performance of the company and of the city’s Department of Corrections was so “incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.” The city paid nearly six million dollars, reportedly the largest settlement involving the death of an inmate in the city’s custody. (Corizon did not contribute any of the funds, because, according to Martha Harbin, the contract stipulated that the city would bear financial responsibility for all malpractice claims.) Corizon’s contract expired at the end of 2015, and it was not renewed. A group of New York-based nonprofit health-care providers has since taken over the provision of medical services at Rikers. The Department of Corrections Commissioner, Cynthia Brann, said in a statement that, with the new arrangement, the city has “taken major steps to overhaul the delivery of healthcare in our jails.” Both jail operators and private health-care companies recognize that it would be better to treat mentally ill people, especially those who are nonviolent, in specialized hospitals or in dedicated units in jails. But building those facilities and hiring counsellors and psychiatrists to staff them requires government funding that many operators don’t have. There are “never enough beds” to accommodate such cases, Patrick Cummiskey, of Wellpath, told me. Jails are “absolutely the wrong place” to treat mental illness, he said, yet they “have become the largest mental-health provider in most communities.” David Perry said that Wellpath no longer bids on contracts in counties where there is a “disproportionate number of mental-health cases” and inadequate local resources to handle them. “We don’t get involved,” he said. “You’re just setting yourself up for this problem.” Poor care for mentally ill prisoners, he added, reflects taxpayers’ unwillingness to fund dedicated facilities and programs, not “our company’s quality.” Opioid addiction, too, is an area in which jail health care is increasingly relied on by default. Last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than seventy-two thousand people died from overdoses—almost two hundred people a day. The C.D.C. has also reported that overdoses now constitute the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of fifty. And many people suffering from addiction pass through jails on charges related to their habit. Madaline Pitkin was one of them. She grew up in Portland, Oregon, and attended Catholic school, where she was a good student. She was “very spirited,” her father, Russell Pitkin, told me. “She was always into competition and sports and was always trying to improve herself.” She enrolled at the University of Oregon, but wasn’t happy there, so she switched, for a time, to Portland Community College. According to the Oregonian, which ran a series of articles on her case, she sometimes paid her bills by working as a barista or, at Christmas, as one of Santa’s elves. At some point in her twenties, she drifted into heroin addiction, and, in April of 2014, she was arrested on a warrant for an earlier arrest and for possession. During her booking at the Washington County jail, which, until May of 2015, had a contract with Corizon Health, she told a nurse that she used a gram of heroin a day. A week later, at the age of twenty-six, she died of dehydration, after vomiting and suffering diarrhea as she went through withdrawal. Company personnel allegedly failed to provide an I.V. to keep her hydrated, and did not respond adequately to her four handwritten pleas for help. In her final request, on April 23rd, she wrote, “I haven’t been able to keep food, liquids, meds down in six days. I feel like I am very close to death. . . . Please help me.” Last December, a federal judge approved a ten-million-dollar judgment against Corizon and Washington County for Pitkin’s family, the largest known amount that the company has been ordered to pay. (Corizon had fully indemnified the county.) Steve Rector, who became Corizon’s C.E.O. last year, said in a statement, “The lessons we’ve learned from this case have been catalysts for significant changes we have made and are still making to our clinical program.” The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said that Pitkin’s death was a “tragedy,” and that it has reformed health care at the jail, with a new private company. Nancy Fishman, a criminal-justice policy expert at the Vera Institute, told me that “every sort of convocation of sheriffs or jail administrators or law enforcement” these days is consumed by the opioid crisis and its impact on jail health care. She added, “There’s just a sort of general sense that we’re being overwhelmed, and we don’t know what to do.” Brent Gibson, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said that “not everyone accepts that substance abuse is a chronic disease.” Some jails treat addiction as a “moral problem,” and treat opioid withdrawal only with drugs that alleviate its symptoms. In other jurisdictions, sheriffs and administrators do follow the recommendations of public-health advocates who argue that the best way to defeat addiction is to guide people toward long-term treatment, with access to methadone or to similar drugs that can allow them to either safely maintain their opioid use or gradually reduce and cease it. The National Commission recommends that prisons and jails adopt a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medications to ease withdrawal and others, such as buprenorphine, that safely satisfy cravings for drugs. The commission also advises psychological counselling and in-detention meetings with recovery groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous. But the resources to support such public-health approaches are small in comparison with the vast sums spent on jails and prisons themselves. David Cloud, of the Vera Institute, said that many rural and poor counties “don’t even have medications or treatment providers in the community” to address opioid addiction, let alone in their jails. On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, then the Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, released a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to begin “the process of reducing—and ultimately ending—our use of privately operated prisons.” The memorandum did not address for-profit correctional-health-care companies directly, but it was the boldest turn away from the country’s partially privatized incarceration system in decades. The Presidential election was less than three months away, and Hillary Clinton, who was then leading Donald Trump comfortably in most polls, tweeted her support, suggesting that the order would stand if she won the White House. The share prices of the country’s two largest private-prison builders and operators, GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America (since renamed CoreCivic), fell by nearly forty per cent in a single day. After Trump was inaugurated, one of the first acts of his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, was to rescind the Yates order. (After the election, according to the Washington Post, GEO hired two people who had worked in Sessions’s Senate office to lobby for the company’s interests.) Opponents of privatized detention have argued, on philosophical and constitutional grounds, that certain governmental powers—such as those to wage war, to use lethal force in the name of the law, and to hold people in detention—should not be hired out to profit-seekers. Yates’s decision was made on a more pragmatic basis: drawing on the findings of a study produced earlier that August by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, she asserted that the government is better at running prisons than corporations are. Private companies, she wrote, “simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs,” and “they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.” The concurrent rise of for-profit health care in jails and prisons has not been accompanied by the kind of public debate, congressional scrutiny, or scholarly research that has informed other fields of health policy. Yet there are notable public and nonprofit alternatives. In some European Union countries, where universal access to health care is fully established, prison and jail health care is often administered by state health services. In the Netherlands, for example, a specialized public service treats prisoners on the basis of an “equivalence principle,” meaning that the care provided should be the same as if they were free citizens. In this country, some physicians and health-care specialists advocate for greater investment in community treatment centers—residential and nonresidential facilities that seek to treat and stabilize individuals suffering from addiction or mental illness through medication, peer counselling, and social services, and where nonviolent offenders suffering from these conditions might be directed, as an alternative to jail. Other practitioners argue that prison health services in the United States work best when they are provided by nonprofits that also deliver medical services for the general population (as is now the case in New York City). Since the late nineteen-eighties, four states—Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, and Connecticut—have contracted prison medical services to their state university systems, whose facilities also serve the public. Newton Kendig, a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., has spent most of his career overseeing health care in prisons. He told me that contracting with public universities has advantages—for example, specialists on a medical-school faculty can consult on prisoners’ cases. The University of Texas has pioneered the use of telemedicine, or videoconferencing, to treat the incarcerated. But the university model hasn’t always succeeded. Last July, after a woman gave birth in her cell at the York Correctional Institution, in Niantic, Connecticut, where health care was overseen by the University of Connecticut, and where there had been other complaints about care, officials transferred responsibility for prisoner health care statewide back to the state corrections agency. I met Kendig last summer in his office at George Washington’s medical school, where he is currently leading an initiative to draw on academic medical expertise to improve health care for inmates. Now in his early sixties, he told me that he had chosen to practice in correctional health because he “wanted to care for at-risk populations.” He served as the director of medicine for Maryland’s correctional facilities, and then, in 1996, he joined the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is overseen by the Surgeon General. After twenty years of service, he retired as a rear admiral and an Assistant Surgeon General. The Commissioned Corps is another public model that might be adapted to provide an alternative to privatization. It is a uniformed medical civil service of more than six thousand physicians, public-health specialists, and other professionals. Among other duties, members design and manage medical and mental-health programs for federal prisoners. They also work for the C.D.C., to monitor and respond to epidemics, and provide medical expertise during emergencies, such as hurricanes. Kendig told me that the corps’s public-service mission, the opportunity it provides to work for diverse federal agencies, and its generous government pensions have helped it to recruit and retain talented personnel devoted to prison health care, which is, as he put it, a “highly structured and paramilitary environment” that requires a “special person” to embrace it for a career. “The advantage of the public model is that public service gives you stability,” he continued. “The turnover in the private sector is very high.” However, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have proved hostile to expansions of publicly funded medical services. Last year, the Administration, as part of its drive to reduce nonmilitary federal spending, proposed cutting the corps’s budget by forty per cent. There are, nevertheless, signs that the country is moving toward a new consensus on criminal-justice reform. That includes support within the Republican Party for public policies that may improve medical services for the incarcerated. A major advancement in the field was reached in May of last year, when the Texas state legislature passed the Sandra Bland Act. On July 10, 2015, Bland, a twenty-eight-year-old African-American woman, was stopped in her car by a police officer in Waller County, northwest of Houston, for failing to signal a lane change. In an encounter captured by the officer’s dashboard camera, Bland argued with him, and he escalated the confrontation, finally pulling out a Taser and shouting, “I will light you up!” He arrested her and booked her into the county jail. During her processing, Bland said that she had attempted suicide earlier that year, following a miscarriage. Three days later, she hanged herself in her cell. A grand jury indicted the officer on a perjury charge, but prosecutors dropped it in exchange for his agreement to never again work as a policeman. Bland’s family reached a settlement with the county, which reportedly paid close to two million dollars. The law enacted in her name requires authorities to make a “good-faith effort” to divert anyone who is arrested and is suffering from acute mental illness or addiction away from jail and into treatment, particularly if the illness or addiction is related to the reason that the person was arrested. The “good-faith” standard for sheriffs and jail operators is a soft one, but lawmakers have created incentives for judges to grant bail to the afflicted, and have provided ninety-two million dollars in new funding for mental-health services and monitoring of people judged to be suicide risks. The Bland Act was introduced by Democrats, but, after some police-reform measures were removed, it passed unanimously in the Republican-led legislature, and was signed by Governor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican. That bipartisan support reinforced what I heard from sheriffs and jail-health specialists elsewhere: that the effort to address the unnecessary suffering and loss of life caused by inadequate mental-health and addiction treatment must transcend the current polarization of national politics. Health care isn’t the only sector of criminal-justice reform in which cross-party coalitions have formed. In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act, which passed in the Senate in a vote of eighty-seven to twelve, and which the House of Representatives approved in a vote of three hundred and sixty to fifty-nine. Among other things, the law is intended to reduce the nation’s incarceration rates by lowering mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Kenneth L. Favier, a theologian and a public-health specialist, argues in his 2017 book, “Humane Health Care for Prisoners,” that a “radical revision” of the criminal-justice and mental-health systems is needed, to transfer “large numbers” of people suffering from mental illness “into community treatment settings as well as prevent such persons from being arrested and incarcerated in the first place.” Historically, sweeping changes in civil rights have occurred only after a moral awakening among at least a vocal minority of the public. So far, the articulation of a better ethic of prison medicine is mostly consigned to a small body of specialized literature, including Favier’s book. His core principle succinctly echoes European policies and standards, as well as the standards advocated in civil-rights lawsuits since Estelle v. Gamble. He writes that, except for “understandable and acceptable” constraints required for the administration of safe custody, “it should not matter that one is a prisoner.” The powerlessness of prisoners makes that a difficult standard to attain, as Jeremy Laintz discovered in Pueblo County. After his hospitalization and surgeries, he entered an in-patient rehabilitation facility in Denver, to learn how to walk again and to strengthen his damaged lung. When he got out, in April of 2017, six months had passed since he was first sentenced to serve three months in jail. He moved in with his parents, started taking buprenorphine, and volunteered for a time at a local needle exchange. Laintz is now forty, and, when I spoke to him on the phone recently, he told me that he is unable to walk for ten minutes without needing to sit down. He is not working. He had done time before, and he understood that, when he went to jail, he would lose many of the rights that are taken for granted by people on the outside. Yet he had always trusted that, if he ever found himself in need of urgent help, he would be taken seriously. On this occasion, he said, “they treated me the whole time like I was lying to them.” But he also felt fortunate: his parents believed him when he said that he was in pain, and they pushed to get him help. Other people have no such advocates. “I know there are people dying,” Laintz said. “I was almost one of them.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Did Britain Overhear Theresa May’s Brexit Plan in a Hotel Bar?,10664,"On Monday night, Oliver Robbins, Theresa May’s chief Brexit negotiator, left a dinner at the residence of the British Ambassador in Brussels and headed back to his hotel. During the chaotic summer of 2016, Robbins, who is forty-three years old, was chosen by May and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the former head of the civil service, to represent Britain in its talks with the European Union. A looming figure with a heavy brow, Robbins has been one of the Prime Minister’s most visible and enduring advisers ever since. When Robbins arrived at his hotel, he joined some colleagues in the bar for a drink. A reporter for ITV News, one of Britain’s main news channels, was sitting nearby and overheard portions of their conversation, in which Robbins outlined the likely endgame to May’s torturous attempt to steer her Brexit deal through the House of Commons. As things stand, Britain will leave the E.U.—with or without an agreement—at 11 p.m. London time on March 29th. In the bar in Brussels, Robbins said that May is planning to make members of Parliament wait until the very last minute before giving them a choice between her unpopular compromise package with the E.U. or a lengthy delay to Brexit, during which the already agonizing negotiations would continue. “If they don’t vote for the deal,” Robbins is reported to have said, “then the extension is a long one.” In politics, as Hannah Arendt said, “speech rules supreme.” Taken on its own, what Robbins disclosed was not particularly surprising, but, in the current Brexit vacuum, it was enough to dominate the news when the story broke the following day. Britain has been without a leader’s voice since December, when it became clear that May could not get her Brexit agreement through Parliament. On January 15th, when she finally tried, she lost by two hundred and thirty votes, the largest government defeat in British history. In the weeks since, there has been all manner of political fiddling—backbench amendments, unlikely alliances of M.P.s, non-talks between May and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to find a way through the impasse—but nothing concrete has emerged. If anything, the respective positions of the E.U., May, and her opponents in Westminster appear to have become further entrenched. Patience is running out. “I’ve been wondering,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, told a press conference in Brussels last week, “what that special place in Hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” On Tuesday, May told M.P.s to bear with her a little longer. “We now all need to hold our nerve,” she said. Hold our nerve for what? May adopted a hard-line strategy for the Brexit negotiations a little more than two years ago. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal,” she said in a grand, set-piece speech, which she delivered in the long gallery of Lancaster House, a Foreign Office residence that, in the Netflix series “The Crown,” often doubles for Buckingham Palace. At the time, and until recently, the threat of walking away from the E.U. without any kind of agreement in place seemed like a piece of bad acting, a crib from “The Art of the Deal.” But, with Brexit now forty-three days away, the possibility of Britain suddenly losing its place in the international order—by accident or by design—is something that you can hear and feel. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Last week, the civil service advertised for staff at a planned “EU Exit Emergencies Centre,” to oversee the widespread disruption to Britain’s ports, food supplies, and general way of life that is expected in the event of no deal. Withdrawing from forty-six years of integration with European regulations and replacing them with nothing at all would complicate everything from aviation rules to fruit inspections to cross-border arrest warrants. The jobs at the E.U.X.E. center, which will operate around the clock for at least six months, were described in the ad as part of an “incredibly high-profile and complex Business Change/Transformation Programme.” Applicants should be “unflappable” and able to “see the emergency trends with little or no information and act appropriately at pace.” The keenest Brexiteers like to imagine a no deal as a kind of cathartic, revolutionary moment, from which a new, leaner Britain will emerge. The jobs at the E.U.X.E. are advertised as lasting for up to two years. Businesses are panicking. Earlier this week, Britain’s Food and Drink Federation compared a no-deal Brexit to the outbreak of the Second World War. “This is the biggest threat that our members and businesses have faced since 1939,” Ian Wright, the group’s chief executive, told the BBC, predicting that a quarter of British food exporters would face bankruptcy if there is more than six weeks of delays at the country’s ports. The following day, the British Chambers of Commerce, which represent more than seventy-five thousand businesses, published twenty questions, on behalf of companies preparing for no deal, that May’s government has failed to answer. (Question No. 16: “Which regulator will be overseeing my business after 29 March 2019 and what rules do I need to follow?”) Multinational corporations are cutting jobs and moving projects out of the U.K. On February 3rd, Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, announced that it would no longer be making its new X-Trail S.U.V. in Sunderland, where it employs almost seven thousand people and where sixty-one per cent of voters decided to leave the E.U. Over all, car production fell by almost ten per cent in the U.K. last year. Britain’s latest official economic data, published on February 11th, showed that growth came to a standstill in December. Medical supplies are likely to be interrupted if there is no Brexit deal. On Wednesday afternoon, I met Martin Sawer, the executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, which represents the logistics firms that transport the drugs used in Britain’s hospitals, pharmacies, and local doctors’ clinics. Around two-thirds of medicines used in the U.K. come from the E.U. The H.D.A. recently analyzed the typical contents of a pharmaceuticals warehouse and found that ninety per cent of its products had touched another country at some point. The vast majority of Britain’s cardboard medical packaging is made in Belgium—an unrecognized consequence of a quarter of a century of seamless trade with the Continent. “It grew up in the time of the single market,” Sawer said, of Britain’s current drug-supply network. “We don’t know any different.” Last summer, officials asked pharmaceutical companies to stockpile six weeks’ worth of medicines, to weather a possible no-deal Brexit. That advice recently changed. Sawer has signed a nondisclosure agreement with the government, so he couldn’t tell me the exact plans, but he suggested that the problem lay at the Strait of Dover—the short crossing of the English Channel, which accounts for the vast majority of Britain’s truck traffic with the E.U. “Six weeks wouldn’t necessarily be enough for that route,” Sawer said. In January, the government chartered extra ferry crossings between France and the ports of Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth, to cope with congestion in the Channel. It also quietly introduced a “Serious Shortage Protocol,” which will allow pharmacists to supply alternative medication to what is listed on a patient’s prescription, in case of a civil emergency. “We are able to ration supply, if we have to,” Sawer said. Brexiteers often summon the memory of Britain’s wartime resilience to indicate that we have what it takes to survive a piffling showdown with the E.U. But the truth is that we are now a nation that makes barely a drop of insulin but that is home to millions of citizens with diabetes. “We’re all consumers now and we expect things immediately,” Sawer told me. “It is only going to take a couple of patients to be in trouble for the government to be seriously embarrassed, and they will come down and they will invoke emergency powers. That is where I think we would soon be. I don’t think it’s about fighting them on the beaches.” Most rational people think that Britain and the E.U. will still avoid the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit. That is a large part of the reason why the British media leaped on Robbins’s bar talk—as proof that there was a plan to extend the talks, a sign that sense will prevail. But most rational people also thought that Britain would vote to stay in the E.U., and Robbins, whom many pro-Brexit campaigners regard as a kind of deep-state saboteur, has been overruled by May before. On Tuesday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who usually has a bearish take on Britain’s departure from the E.U., described Brexit as “the first test of a new global order,” which might yet demonstrate a new approach to international trade and diplomacy that is more accountable to populations who feel they have not shared in the spoils of the party. “It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy,” Carney said. The anger that drove the Brexit vote in 2016—around immigration, unfettered capitalism, and being ignored by political élites—was real and has not gone anywhere. But, in the past three years, Britain’s leaders have failed even to start a conversation about what a more equitable society might look like. With exit day only six weeks away and the risk of chaos so high, it is possible that something much worse is about to emerge.

Turning Bystanders Into First Responders,35118,"One April morning in 2014, a sixteen-year-old sophomore at Franklin Regional Senior High, in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, stole two butcher knives from his parents’ kitchen, hid them in his backpack, and took them to school. He was wearing all black and, according to witnesses, had a “blank expression.” Just before first period, in the hall of the science wing, he stabbed several classmates. Then he pulled the fire alarm. As the corridor filled with people, the boy moved down the hallway, a knife in each hand, stabbing more students. He turned and raced back up the hall—an administrator remembered him “flailing the knives like he was swimming the backstroke.” One girl later testified, “I could feel that my lip wasn’t attached to my face anymore.” A boy, stabbed in the belly, recalled, “I was gushing blood.” The students at Franklin Regional, which is seventeen miles east of Pittsburgh, had been trained to lock themselves inside classrooms during a “code red” event. In one room, a home-economics teacher called 911 as she attended to an injured boy. A dispatcher asked where the “patient” had been hurt. “The lower abdomen,” the teacher said. “On the right side.” “Do you have any way to control the bleeding?” the dispatcher asked. “I’m putting pressure on it,” the teacher said. She was stanching the blood with paper towels. This was helpful, the dispatcher told her, saying, “If it starts soaking through, I don’t want you to lift it up at all. Find anything else you can to put on top of that.” The teacher had been applying pressure for about four minutes when the dispatcher said, “We have the actor in custody,” adding, “But I don’t want you to let any of your students leave that room.” As the teacher bore down on the wound, she talked with the injured boy, her voice tense but cheerful. They joked that he could use the experience in a college-application essay. When he predicted that his mother was going to “have a panic attack,” the teacher said, “I think she will.” Then she said, “I never thought I’d have to do this.” Gracey Evans, a seventeen-year-old junior at the time, remembers that she was walking down the hall with her friend Brett when someone rushed past them “like a black mass.” She didn’t realize that Brett was hurt until he “fell to the ground, withering in pain”—he had been stabbed in the back. In front of her, a boy in a red hoodie grabbed his stomach. A third boy collapsed. The victims took refuge in a nearby science classroom. Brett’s wound did not look life-threatening, so Gracey dropped to her knees beside the boy in the red hoodie. She raised the hem of his sweatshirt and saw blood pouring out of a clean slit above his waistband. Although she had never witnessed real physical trauma before, she didn’t flinch. Her mother was an orthopedic nurse, and she had seen videos of athletes’ legs broken at grotesque angles. Gracey recalls that someone handed her a “big wad” of those “terrible” brown paper towels that aren’t very absorbent. She placed them over the gash, interlaced her fingers, and pushed. A dancer, she’d been told that she was stronger than she appeared, and she worried that she might be hurting her classmate, but she kept pressing. The boy suddenly vomited, and part of his liver emerged from the wound. Gracey, nauseated, let go, and blood rushed out again. “I’m so sorry!” she cried, unable to continue. Another student, who happened to be an E.M.T., took over, buying the boy more time. Twenty-one people had been knifed, several severely, yet everyone survived. (The attacker was later sentenced to a minimum of twenty-three and a half years in prison.) Law-enforcement and health-care professionals in the Pittsburgh area took note of the fortitude and the competence of many bystanders. Listening to a playback of the teacher’s 911 call, they marvelled at her calm and her effectiveness. Brad Orsini, an F.B.I. agent who worked the case, told me, “You’d have thought it was just another day for this woman.” At one point, the teacher had told the boy, “You know what? Sometimes when stuff happens, you go into a different state of mind. You surprise yourself at how you can handle things.” Acategory of emergency known as an Intentional Mass Casualty Event is now considered a public-health crisis. In recent years, deadly attacks have occurred at schools, offices, concerts, sporting events, shopping malls, and houses of worship. They have involved guns, knives, trucks, and improvised explosive devices. In March, a gunman killed fifty people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Much attention has been given to the rising frequency of mass shootings in the United States, but equally alarming is their worsening severity. In the attack at Columbine High School, which occurred in 1999, thirteen people were killed and twenty-four were injured. In the 2017 massacre at a music festival in Las Vegas, fifty-eight people were killed and eight hundred and fifty-one were injured. The arsenal of the Las Vegas perpetrator included the AR-15 assault rifle, a weapon that has been used in many rampages. (In fact, he had fourteen of them with him.) Bullets shot from an AR-15 travel at an extremely high velocity; the force of the ammunition can shatter the bones in a human arm merely by grazing it. Last year, Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General, said, “More and more, the injuries we’re seeing in the civilian world look like combat casualties.” After the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida—seventeen killed, seventeen injured—a trauma surgeon opened up a victim to find at least one organ in “shreds,” with “nothing left to repair.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" For victims whose injuries are serious but survivable, rapid treatment is essential. A person can bleed to death in as little as five to eight minutes. Traditionally, during an active-shooter event, paramedics held back until law enforcement secured the area, then rushed in to treat the wounded and evacuate them to hospitals. That approach changed after Columbine. During that event, rescuers, unable to determine if the killers were dead or hiding, didn’t reach some victims for hours. In a second-floor science lab, teachers and students were stranded with a coach, Dave Sanders, who had been shot once in the neck and once in the back. Two Eagle Scouts applied pressure to his wounds, and someone else put a sign in a window—“1 bleeding to death.” Sanders died at the scene; it’s unclear whether he would have survived with quicker or different treatment. The Las Vegas shooter positioned himself in a sniper’s nest—a hotel window overlooking the festival—and sprayed the crowd with bullets. In this case, it was impossible to stage an orderly transition from a security phase to a medical phase: victims arrived at hospitals in Ubers and pickup trucks, or in the arms of loved ones and strangers. As public shootings became commonplace, doctors started paying more attention to them. One such doctor was Lenworth Jacobs, the head trauma surgeon at Hartford Hospital, in Connecticut. He’d grown up in Jamaica, where his father was a doctor; when Jacobs was about seven, he and his dad came across an injured bicyclist by the side of the road, and the sight of his father urgently helping a stranger left a lasting impression. Jacobs told me that trauma surgery appealed to him because each case contains a “beginning, middle, and end.” A patient presents with a problem—“a gunshot wound, a stabbing”—which is then resolved, one way or another. When Jacobs wasn’t operating, he devised protocols that would help increase survival rates in the Emergency Department. At Hartford, he founded Life Star, the first helicopter-ambulance service in Connecticut. On December 14, 2012, a deranged young man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns entered Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, an hour away from Hartford Hospital. The hospital is a Level 1 trauma center, a designation that signifies the highest level of care. As news of the shooter reached Jacobs, he prepared to send medevac choppers to Newtown, but was soon advised to stand down. “You hear ‘Everybody’s dead’—and that makes no sense,” he told me. “Then you hear ‘It’s children’—and that makes no sense.” Twenty first graders had been killed, along with six administrators and teachers. Jacobs wondered whether the shocking number of casualties was related to the local emergency response, or to the nature of the gunshot injuries, or both. He reviewed the autopsy reports, and, although he had successfully operated on patients with unimaginable physical trauma, he was nevertheless unprepared for what he saw. Many of the children had been shot multiple times, at close range. The reports, he said, were “overwhelming.” The victims at Sandy Hook likely died instantly, but Jacobs, unable to “go back to business as usual,” kept thinking about what could be done to reduce casualties in the future. There was not even a second to waste in such incidents: the wounded had to be treated immediately, at the scene. Jacobs was a regent of the American College of Surgeons, an organization with some eighty thousand members worldwide. At an A.C.S. meeting soon after Sandy Hook, he urged his colleagues to focus on mitigating losses in Intentional Mass Casualty Events. “Obviously, prevention is the way to go,” he said. “But, once something has happened, how can we increase survival?” In trauma care, the primary cause of preventable death is hemorrhage. External bleeding can always be controlled in an extremity wound, if it is addressed quickly enough: no one should bleed to death from an arm or a leg injury, even with the loss of a limb. This message had never been clearly conveyed to the public. Four months after Sandy Hook, Jacobs convened a small group of physicians, military leaders, and law-enforcement officials—including representatives of the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense—at Hartford Hospital. The group became known as the Hartford Consensus. One member was Frank Butler, an ophthalmologist and a former Navy seal platoon commander. In the nineteen-nineties, Butler reviewed the state of battlefield trauma care in the U.S. military. He ultimately discovered that, during the Vietnam War, more than thirty-four hundred service members died because of hemorrhaging from extremity wounds. For Butler, a solution came to mind: tourniquets. The devices are known to have been used as far back as 1674, during the Franco-Dutch War. Early versions consisted of a strip of cloth and a stick, which was used as a windlass. Modern tourniquets work much the same way: you snugly encircle a bleeding limb with a band of cloth, then turn the windlass, tightening the band until it stops the flow of blood. Tourniquets lost favor after the Civil War, because of their association with gangrene and amputation. By the time of Butler’s review, medical doctrine had long held that tourniquets did more harm than good. It was true that the longer a tourniquet stayed in place the more it could damage the surrounding tissues and nerves, but in the modern era a patient could usually be evacuated quickly to a hospital. Moreover, early tourniquets hadn’t always been used properly—they were strapped below the wound instead of above it, or they weren’t tight enough. In a report, Butler argued that “the ‘no tourniquet’ rule,” a “venerated tenet of prehospital trauma care,” was wrong. As he recently put it to me, “Tourniquets save lives—period.” Butler’s recommendations also introduced the concept of “tactical combat casualty care”: soldiers, trained with basic lifesaving skills and equipment, could act as front-line medics when necessary. Several élite combat units immediately embraced the idea. The Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment—whose members had seen comrades bleed to death from extremity wounds during the 1993 battle in Mogadishu—began training with tourniquets during simulated missions. Soldiers were taught how to apply a tourniquet to themselves or to someone else within seconds. A group of soldiers at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, designed a tourniquet that was optimized for battlefield conditions; the device, which came to include a built-in windlass, secured by a plastic clip and a Velcro strap, is called a Combat Application Tourniquet, or C-A-T. An outdated technique had become a modern cure. Tourniquets are now standard issue in the U.S. military, along with hemostatic dressings—sterile gauze infused with kaolin, a clay that promotes swift blood clotting. By 2012, the Journal of Vascular Surgery reported, some soldiers were embarking on missions with tourniquets “already in place” on their limbs. In April, 2013, when Jacobs and the other experts convened at Hartford Hospital to talk about Intentional Mass Casualty Events, they discussed the tourniquet revival. The group decided that the military’s standardized approach to controlling external hemorrhage could be applied to civilian life: members of the public could be trained to identify and treat life-threatening bleeding. The Hartford Consensus devised a protocol, Stop the Bleed, in the hope that it would become as widely known as C.P.R. and Stop, Drop, and Roll. Jacobs told me that Stop the Bleed training had to be short enough to fit “between church and cooking dinner, or between dinner and the football game,” and simple enough for a sixth grader to understand. The instruction had to focus on one goal: “Keep the blood in the body.” He and his colleagues knew that the protocol would save lives if they could persuade people to use it. Thirteen days after the Hartford Consensus first met, explosive devices filled with nails and ball bearings detonated near the crowded finish line of the Boston Marathon. The sidewalks of Boylston Street were strewn with injured spectators. As a team of specialists later wrote in The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, the bombing was the first major terrorist event in the modern United States “with multiple, severe, war-like, lower-extremity injuries.” More than a dozen people lost limbs in the blasts. Boston has many hospitals, and paramedics were quick to the scene, but they were astonished by how many spectators had already applied pressure to wounds, using clothing or coffee-shop napkins. “Much of the early lifesaving was performed by amateurs,” the Washington Post reported. Although more than two hundred people were injured, only three died, and The New England Journal of Medicine credited this achievement, in large part, to “courageous civilians.” The marathon attack confirmed the Hartford Consensus’s view: people would instantly help one another during a crisis, even when the injuries were almost unbearable to see, much less to touch. The real first responders were bystanders. One icy morning in mid-January, Matthew Neal, a trauma surgeon and a research scientist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, got in his car and drove twenty-six miles north of the city. He arrived at Mars Area High School, where more than two hundred employees of the public-school district were filing into the auditorium, for a mandatory Stop the Bleed seminar. They wore puffy coats and snow boots, and carried Starbucks cups and thermoses that were still warm. Neal, who is thirty-eight, is tall and lean, with a resonant voice. People call him Macky. He has his own laboratory, which recently received a grant partly funded by the Department of Defense to study treatments for types of bleeding that don’t respond to compression, such as certain belly wounds. One night, when I joined his family for dinner, he told me, “My whole focus is blood.” He stood at the front of the auditorium with Raquel Forsythe, another U.P.M.C. trauma surgeon, who wore a voluminous red scarf and had her hair in a high bun. They used a laptop to project a presentation onto a screen. One slide read, “Why do I need this training?” The answers included “mass shootings,” “motor-vehicle crashes,” “home injuries,” and “bombings.” The stabbings at Franklin Regional Senior High had occurred in the wake of other horrific attacks in the Pittsburgh area, including shootings at an L.A. Fitness franchise and a psychiatric clinic. The city’s trauma specialists reviewed these tragedies, but, Neal told me, they often ended a case analysis “feeling a bit empty.” No matter how nimble first responders are, Neal is prone to say, “I can’t do anything if the patient’s dead.” In October, 2015, the American College of Surgeons launched a national Stop the Bleed campaign. The White House backed it. President Barack Obama declared that national disaster preparedness was a “shared responsibility” between citizens and the government, and Vice-President Joe Biden described Stop the Bleed as a “call to action” for anyone “in a position to help.” Cities at high risk for gun violence, including St. Louis and Baltimore, welcomed the program. Laurie Punch, a trauma surgeon and a leader of St. Louis’s Stop the Bleed efforts, has said that trainers “want people to discover that they’re not just victims—that they can actually save a life.” The Orlando Fire Department was modernizing its first-responder protocol when, in June, 2016, a gunman shot up the Pulse night club, killing forty-nine people and injuring fifty-three. Trauma specialists based at George Washington University Hospital, in Washington, D.C., found that four of the victims might have survived if they had received “basic E.M.S. care” within ten minutes and had been transported to a trauma hospital within an hour. (None of those who died had received tourniquets or other bleeding-control interventions.) Two days after the Pulse shooting, the American Medical Association voted to adopt a new policy aimed at training the general public in bleeding control. In Pittsburgh, Andrew Peitzman, U.P.M.C.’s chief of surgery, urged the hospital system to embrace Stop the Bleed. Seminars were soon held throughout the region, with a special emphasis on training law-enforcement officers. U.P.M.C. announced that it would donate more than a million dollars to provide such supplies as tourniquets and hemostatic gauze to every public school, and to put “a tourniquet on the belt of every law-enforcement officer in western Pennsylvania.” By the start of this year, nearly forty thousand people in western Pennsylvania had been trained, and bleeding-control kits had been handed out to some five hundred public schools in the area—more than anywhere else in the country. Stop the Bleed uses a “ripple” approach: volunteers train people, who, in turn, train others. At the Mars Area High School seminar, Neal and Forsythe were the volunteers, along with a group of Cranberry Township paramedics and U.P.M.C. flight nurses. The team also included a more unusual participant: Neal’s nine-year-old son, Cameron, who often helps his father teach workshops. He was standing with the other volunteers in a red-and-blue striped shirt, khaki cargo pants, and glasses. Before Christmas, Cameron’s third-grade teacher had assigned how-to presentations; recommended topics included how to bake cookies or make a paper airplane. Although Cameron has various areas of expertise—Legos, kung fu—he chose to demonstrate Stop the Bleed. The standard presentation contains graphic images: an enormous leg gash, a nearly severed foot. Macky Neal warns audiences that the photographs may be upsetting, and trainees sometimes look away or leave. The queasiness is understandable. Blood is supposed to remain inside the body, and it can be sickening to see it released, especially in large quantities. Blood is slippery and messy, and it has a strong metallic smell. Under certain circumstances, it may transmit disease. In traumatic injuries, blood may be mixed with body tissue and teeth and bone. Neal, the son of a Pennsylvania State Police commander, believes that showing people images of severe injuries, if done sensitively, can reduce their unease in a crisis later, just as the use of dummies in C.P.R. training helps people overcome the discomfort of performing chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation during a cardiac arrest. Primarily, the images are intended to help attendees identify life-threatening bleeding. Many bystanders’ instinct is to cover up blood. But, as Forsythe put it, “to stop bleeding you need to see bleeding.” Paramedics talk about getting patients “trauma naked”—moving aside any clothing and pinpointing the source of hemorrhage. The loss of a limb is automatically considered life-threatening. In other cases, there are warning signs: Is blood pooling around the victim? Is the wound spurting? Are bandages saturated? Bystanders should pay close attention to a victim who becomes suddenly irrational or loses consciousness, symptoms that suggest the onset of hemorrhagic shock. Explaining that “people can bleed to death in as little as five to eight minutes,” Forsythe told the audience, “It often takes E.M.S. that long to respond.” The location of a wound dictates treatment. For an arm or a leg, use a tourniquet. For a “junctional” injury—neck, armpit, groin—press against the wound or pack it with gauze. (Place the victim on a hard surface, to maximize pressure.) For a chest, belly, or head wound, the most helpful interventions, such as suction or a needle thoracostomy, require E.M.S. training, but applying pressure can help a patient hold on. Skeptics sometimes ask Neal whether administering emergency care will traumatize a young person, to which he responds, “It may be more traumatic to stand there and watch someone die.” The National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health recently received a fema grant to design a Stop the Bleed-style program for schools. Neal’s son climbed onstage, to demonstrate how to address a severely bleeding wound. He knelt over an object that resembled a piece of smooth firewood. It was a training limb the size of an average male adult’s thigh, with the spongy consistency of flesh. A “wound” in the limb went all the way to the “bone.” Cameron started by explaining manual pressure. He told the audience to place one hand on top of the other, interlocking the fingers for stability. “You’re gonna push as hard as you can, shrugging your shoulders,” for at least ten minutes, he said, or until help arrives. His father added, “This is not ‘one hand while you’re calling for help on your phone.’ When it’s your job to hold pressure, that is exclusively your job.” The next subject was tourniquets. When a victim has a potentially fatal injury to an arm or a leg, Neal and Cameron explained, tourniquets should be applied right away and should be “high and tight.” Cinch the tourniquet just below the armpit or groin, they counselled, and “you will never be wrong.” Cameron slipped a C-A-T onto the fake limb. As he cranked the windlass, Neal asked, “How do we know when to stop?” Cameron said, “When you don’t see any more blood coming out.” Once a tourniquet is on, it must be left on: only a medical professional should remove it. (Doctors advise against using improvised tourniquets—without a proper windlass, a belt or a tie won’t be tight enough.) They moved on to wound packing. Forsythe told the crowd, “This is the part that gives some people the willies.” The hole in the fake limb simulated a gunshot or a stabbing injury. Cameron poked an index finger into it and said, “As you can see, it’s really deep.” He steadily thumbed length after length of gauze into the hole, and said, “You’re gonna stuff it in.” The audience laughed. The wound held several feet of gauze. When no more fit, Cameron balled up the remaining material and used it to apply pressure on top. His father explained that, beneath the skin, a wound could be surprisingly large—it was important to “get gauze down in there, to occupy that space.” Packing a wound added pressure that impeded blood flow, and the kaolin in the gauze encouraged clotting. In a mass-casualty incident, using tourniquets and packing wounds could free up first responders to move on to other patients. The audience had questions. Which should be used first with an extremity wound, a tourniquet or wound packing? A tourniquet. What if the patient fights you? Calmly but firmly explain what you’re doing, and acknowledge that the tourniquet may be painful. Forsythe noted, “Tourniquets hurt—a lot.” (Paramedics typically give victims pain medication.) What if you don’t have any hemostatic gauze? “If I needed to, right now, I could take off my scarf or my jacket and use that,” she said. For the second half of the training, everyone trooped to the cafeteria and broke into groups. Each table held a fake limb and a Stop the Bleed kit. The basic kit, which is sold online by the American College of Surgeons, costs sixty-nine dollars. It contains a C-A-T, a compression bandage, protective gloves, hemostatic gauze, and a Sharpie, for writing “tourniquet,” and the time it was put on, in a highly visible location, such as across the patient’s forehead. Neal and his son claimed a table near the cafeteria’s plate-glass windows, which overlooked a parking lot white with ice. Their students included a track-and-field coach, two custodians, an eighth-grade English teacher, a fifth-grade math teacher, and various administrators. One of the administrators watched the math teacher stuff gauze into the training limb, and said to Neal, “I mean, I understand that we need to stop the bleeding, but if you use your T-shirt to pack a wound—that’s not sterile!” “You’re not gonna introduce a life-threatening infection,” Neal told her. “We can take care of that at the hospital, with antibiotics.” He added, “I don’t mean to be blunt, but let me worry about that problem.” As everyone took a turn with the fake limb, the track coach, who had taught at the school for thirty years, mentioned that, after Sandy Hook, each of the classrooms at Mars had been issued a five-gallon “lockdown” bucket. The typical bucket contains gloves, bandages, Smarties candy, and kitty litter, which can be used as a makeshift toilet. Shaking his head, he said, “Times have changed.” Brad Orsini, one of the F.B.I. agents who worked the Franklin Regional case, retired in December, 2016. The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh hired him right away, as its first director of community security. Violence affecting the Jewish community had “become increasingly common around the world,” the group’s C.E.O., Jeffrey Finkelstein, said at the time. Orsini spent twenty-eight years in the F.B.I.; during part of that time, he was a crisis manager. His new job entails conducting security assessments of the federation’s seventy or so buildings and training the fifty thousand members of the local Jewish community in how to stay safe during an Intentional Mass Casualty Event. Orsini and the federation have also begun providing free training at mosques, through the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh. At Orsini’s workshops, he stresses the importance of maintaining situational awareness: don’t walk around wearing earbuds or staring at a phone. At offices and places of worship, it’s essential to have worked out an escape plan, and to practice it regularly. To smash open a window, he advises trainees, strike the corners, not the center. He teaches Run, Hide, Fight—the protocol that has become a dreadful necessity as mass shootings have proliferated. One morning in January, I sat in on security training at a Pittsburgh-area organization. The door was open; I had walked right in. In a conference room, employees were gathering around freshly delivered pizzas. Orsini, who is tall and bald, with a strong Pennsylvania accent, told them, “Our worst nightmare is somebody walking in here with a semi-automatic rifle and high-powered rounds.” On a large screen, he cued up security footage from January 6, 2017, of the baggage-claim area of the Fort Lauderdale airport. As travellers wheeled their luggage past carrousels, a young man reached into his waistband, removed a handgun, and began firing at random. Orsini told the room, “Watch what the people do. They just stood there, or got down on the ground.” The gunman killed five people. The shooting lasted about a minute. Orsini asked the group, “In seventy seconds, how far can you move?” A woman said, “So you’re saying run.” “I’m saying run,” he said, adding, “Do whatever you can to stay alive.” In early September, 2018, Orsini taught the same protocol at Tree of Life, a synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The Jewish Healthcare Foundation had bought a bleeding-control kit for every synagogue in town. Tree of Life had installed a kit near the front door and was upgrading its security measures. The rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, did not like carrying his cell phone on Shabbat, for religious reasons, but Orsini urged him to reconsider. On the morning of Saturday, October 27th, Myers began services at nine-forty-five. At five minutes to ten, an armed man entered and started shooting. Myers instructed congregants to run, then he, too, fled, as he had been trained to do. From a second-floor bathroom, he called 911. The gunfire grew louder, then softer, then louder again, giving him a rough sense of the shooter’s movement through the building. Myers’s phone call helped first responders understand what was happening inside. When the gunman attempted to leave the synagogue, two police officers confronted him, and he shot at them; one was hit, and the other took shrapnel. The shooter then retreated into the building. For the next hour and a half, the city’s emergency airwaves squawked with the communications of police, medics, and swat operators working the scene. “We are pinned down by gunfire. He’s firing out of the front of the building with an automatic weapon.” “Trauma surgeon is with the team.” “We got four D.O.A.s—checking on one more.” “I got one alive!” “Four additional victims. Eight down, one rescued.” “Two rescued from the basement; three more victims in the basement.” “Contact! Contact! Shots fired! Shots fired!” “We have one operator hit high in the arm. We have tourniquetted it.” “He’s carrying an AR-15 and a Glock.” The emergency-medicine physician at the scene was Keith Murray, who serves as the medical director of the city’s swat force. He leads a team called the Tactical Emergency Medical Service unit, which adheres to the “tactical combat casualty care” protocol that Frank Butler recommended in the nineties, after reviewing the Vietnam War data. Murray and the paramedics he oversees have undergone advanced swat training, including in the use of firearms. Dressed in body armor, carrying sidearms, they move with swat operators to the “far forward” point of conflict, to provide medical care as soon as possible. Like combat medics, they risk their lives in order to save lives. Tactical medicine, in the civilian world, is an emerging specialty. Teams like Murray’s have been trained in hundreds of municipalities, from Los Angeles to Nantucket. Jim Morrissey, a former tactical paramedic for the F.B.I.’s San Francisco swat team, recently noted that “ ‘active shooter’ incidents have shifted the way law enforcement operates.” Pittsburgh’s first responders use an app that alerts them to urgent calls. When an incident occurs, they receive bulletins on their phones, and they can notify the group if they plan to respond. As the Tree of Life emergency unfolded, Murray and ninety others responded that they were on the way. Murray, who is in his early forties, grew up in Nevada, in a military family. He attended medical school in Chicago, where he became interested in tactical medicine. In 2011, he moved to Pittsburgh to start the Tactical Emergency Medical Service unit, and he and Macky Neal became friends. Both have young children, and wives in the medical field: Neal’s wife, Donielle, runs a research project on liver cancer; Murray’s wife, Jennifer, is a surgeon. Until Neal met Murray, he’d never heard of a trauma doctor being attached to law enforcement. When Rabbi Myers dialled 911, Murray was getting his son, Aspen, ready for a birthday party for Neal’s daughter, Ellie. As Murray raced toward the scene, Neal, who was heading straight to the hospital, called him and asked, “Can this be real?” Murray and his unit entered Tree of Life wearing Kevlar helmets and body armor, alongside swat operators. Murray carried a Glock in a drop holster on his left thigh. The pockets on his tactical vest held medical gear, including hemostatic dressings, chest seals, and tourniquets. Inside the synagogue, they found a woman who had been shot in the upper right arm, and put a tourniquet on her. They cleared room after room, making their way to the third floor, where the shooter had barricaded himself in a classroom. As operators forced their way inside, the shooter fired. The point man went down, with a shot to the head. Another operator positioned himself on the ground in front of him, so that his body armor could block bullets “like a sponge.” The other operators couldn’t access the room because the first two lay in the doorway. An officer shot rounds through the wall, but the attacker was moving. “He’d shoot and move, shoot and move,” Murray told me. swat operators splashed light on the darkened space, to get their bearings, and saw dust falling from the disintegrating ceiling, like snow. An officer dragged the point man out of the doorway and down the stairs, to a treatment station that Murray had set up. The team cut away his clothes and saw that he had been hit in multiple locations, including the left arm and both legs. As the gunfire continued, Murray put two tourniquets on the point man’s arm and a tourniquet on each leg. The officer who made the rescue had been shot in the wrist, and a teammate tourniquetted him. All eleven of the congregants who were killed died before Murray’s unit arrived. Everyone who left Tree of Life as a patient survived. The shooter, shot in the wrist and the hip, surrendered. “Suspect’s talking about ‘all these Jews need to die,’ ” someone on the emergency airwaves told a dispatcher. Murray’s team packed the attacker’s hip wound and put a tourniquet on his arm, and sent him out alive. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Personal Toll of Whistle-Blowing,52991,"On the morning of September 17, 2009, Darren Sewell left his office at Freedom Health, the Tampa health-insurance company where he was a vice-president, and climbed into his Chevy Tahoe. He drove to Sonny’s BBQ, a restaurant nearby, where he picked up barbecue sauce for the sandwich he had brought for lunch. Then he continued on until he reached a drab stretch of road lined with gas stations and scraggly palm trees, where he pulled into a parking lot and waited, as discreetly as possible, to meet his F.B.I. handler. Sewell, a physician, was thirty-four years old, six feet four inches tall, and broad-shouldered, with an earnest smile and barely perceptible dimples. He was born with one eye slightly crossed, and it still drifted when he was tired or feeling stressed; strangers sometimes found it disconcerting, but his quick wit and easy sense of humor usually dispelled any tension. In the parking lot, Sewell looked around nervously. He noticed that there was a large puddle in the parking space next to his car, where the F.B.I. agent would pull in, so he moved to another space, only to find himself boxed in by other cars. He moved again, but then decided that there were too many people milling around, and drove to a smaller parking annex. There, he found that he could no longer pick up the radio station he’d been listening to, so he pulled out, turned around, and backed his car into the same space, thinking that might help. Later, in audio notes that Sewell recorded about the day, he made fun of his clumsy attempt to be inconspicuous. “I realized I had changed my parking spot about seventeen times,” he said. “And had everyone that was sitting there for lunch probably wondering whether to call the F.B.I. to find out whether I was a terrorist or not.” Sewell had joined Freedom, which made most of its money administering Medicare plans, in 2007. The financial crisis was beginning, and employment opportunities were drying up across the country, but the sector of the health-care industry that drew its revenue from Medicare was booming. During his time at Freedom, Sewell had become convinced that the company was defrauding the government of hundreds of millions of dollars by carrying out a sophisticated set of scams targeted at a new program called Medicare Advantage. Sewell, an avid reader of John Grisham novels, had been so appalled by what he observed, and so intrigued by the romanticism of going undercover, that he had decided to become a whistle-blower. When Ed Ortega, the F.B.I. agent, arrived, Sewell joined him in his vehicle. Sewell had told Ortega that a meeting at Freedom later that day might provide valuable evidence. The two men had been working together for several weeks, and they got along well—Sewell later described Ortega as “absolutely the friendliest guy there could be”—but this was their first time out in the field together, and Sewell was taken aback by Ortega’s stern demeanor. “I just didn’t see him as a very intimidating person. Well, when I was in the car with him, I cannot begin to explain how wrong I was,” Sewell later said. “He reached out and shook my hand and nearly broke it . . . you just got this feeling that, my God, if he had to, he could just reach over and snap your neck without even thinking about it.” Ortega had been a special agent with the F.B.I. for seventeen years, and he was experienced in health-care-fraud investigations. He tried to set Sewell at ease as he rolled up a piece of clear tape and stuck it inside Sewell’s shirt pocket, preparing to outfit him with a small recording device. Sewell was surprised by how low-tech the recorder looked, like something you’d find in a cluttered kitchen drawer. “It reminded me of kind of an old TV-antenna connector, but miniaturized,” he said. The device would record for between two and four hours, and under no circumstances should Sewell fiddle with it. It wasn’t easy to get a judge’s permission to secretly record executives, and strict rules governed how it could be done; Ortega would have to be the one to turn the device on and off. The wire would capture everything that Sewell did. “All I could keep thinking of was, the whole world in court someday is going to know what radio station I listen to, and hear my pen click, and, you know, when I’m sitting here scratching myself, is the stenographer going to realize that that rustling isn’t papers, it’s me scratching myself?” Sewell said. “But Ed had said in an earlier conversation not to worry, these people are professionals, they’ve heard you burp and fart. . . . You’ll never surprise these guys.” Ortega warned Sewell that he would probably feel conspicuous, as if everyone he encountered knew immediately that he was wearing a wire, but urged him to go about his day as normal. He gave Sewell some final words of advice—“Don’t worry, just relax”—and then sent him back to Freedom, the recorder running in his pocket. The first documented whistle-blowing case in the United States took place in 1777, not long after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when a group of naval officers, including Samuel Shaw and Richard Marven, witnessed their commanding officer torturing British prisoners of war. When they reported the misconduct to Congress, the commanding officer charged Shaw and Marven with libel, and both men were jailed. The following year, Congress passed a law protecting whistle-blowers, and Shaw and Marven were acquitted by a jury. Institutional denial, obfuscation, and retaliation are hallmarks of many whistle-blowing cases. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, the New York City police officer Frank Serpico captured the popular imagination when he tried to expose rampant bribery and corruption in the N.Y.P.D., culminating in an episode in which he was shot in the face under bizarre circumstances during a drug raid. (He eventually took his evidence to the Times, which published a front-page story that led to an independent investigation that ultimately validated his allegations.) Since then, notable whistle-blowers have included Karen Silkwood, who revealed worker-safety issues inside an Oklahoma nuclear plant; Jeffrey Wigand, who went on “60 Minutes” in 1996 and disclosed that the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation had misled the public about the addictive and carcinogenic properties of cigarettes; Sherron Watkins, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron; and, in 2013, the National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information about vast government surveillance programs. Whistle-blowers are usually, but not always, employees or members of the group on which they’re blowing the whistle; after they do so, their lives are never the same. To become a whistle-blower, Darren Sewell had filed what is known as a “qui tam” complaint—the term comes from a Latin phrase that translates as “he who brings an action for the king as well as for himself.” Qui-tam cases are brought under the False Claims Act, a law passed in 1863, under President Lincoln, in response to war profiteers peddling defective weapons and ailing mules to the Union Army. The law allows private citizens to file suit on behalf of the government against anyone believed to be defrauding the government. The vast majority of these cases involve health care. To some, qui-tam cases are controversial because whistle-blowers share in the money that the government recovers. This provision was included in the legislation to encourage individuals, especially those who might be involved in the theft themselves, to report the abuse. One of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Jacob Howard, of Michigan, said that he had based the qui-tam provision on the “old-fashioned idea of hold[ing] out a temptation, and ‘setting a rogue to catch a rogue’ . . . a reward for the informer who comes into court and betrays his co-conspirator.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? The False Claims Act was strengthened in 1986, after a push by Senator Charles Grassley, of Iowa. Whistle-blowers can now share between fifteen and twenty-five per cent of the recovery, depending on such factors as the importance of their contribution. This change was an effort to recognize the financial toll of being a whistle-blower, both in lost employment and in legal fees incurred during the arduous process of building a case. The law effectively turned average citizens into a fleet of amateur federal agents, and it helped to reveal the staggering amount of money wrongfully extracted from government programs. A recent government report indicated that in 2017 alone almost $2.6 billion was recovered in health-care-fraud judgments and settlements. Two hundred and sixty-two million dollars of that was awarded to whistle-blowers. Medicare Advantage, the program that Sewell believed Freedom was abusing, is at the center of a growing number of fraud cases, some of which involve the biggest names in the health-insurance industry. The regulations around the issue are complicated, however, and legal questions about what constitutes prosecutable fraud are still the subject of debate. In 2017, the Department of Justice joined a multimillion-dollar case against the nation’s largest insurer, UnitedHealth Group, alleging widespread fraud dating back to 2006. The Justice Department is also investigating several other health insurers, including Anthem, Humana, Cigna, Health Net, and Aetna. An analysis co-authored by Fred Schulte, at the Center for Public Integrity, estimated that insurance companies had received nearly seventy billion dollars in undeserved Medicare Advantage payments between 2008 and 2013. Peter Budetti, who served in health-policy roles in Congress and as a deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (C.M.S.), told me that experts believe the real figures are up to ten times what the government actually recoups. “We’ve never been able to get a direct measure of exactly how much fraud there is, but one of the clearest indicators is that, the more money is spent on fighting fraud, the more money is recovered by the government,” he said. He now works as an attorney at Phillips & Cohen, a firm that specializes in whistle-blowing cases. Fraud perpetrated by companies in the health-care industry, he said, is especially pernicious. “On the one hand, they are stealing public money,” he told me. “And on the other hand that money is not going to where it’s supposed to go, which is to taking care of people. They aren’t stealing from people who are selling imported shoes. They are stealing from people who would otherwise be immunizing kids or delivering babies. That’s the heart of it.” Critics of the whistle-blower payments argue that the windfalls could encourage people to induce corporate sabotage. William P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for Attorney General, has called the False Claims Act an “abomination” spurred by “the mercenary motives of private bounty hunters.” But Budetti told me that, in his experience, most whistle-blowers are driven by frustration and moral outrage, not by money. “Whistle-blowers are one of the absolutely central ingredients in fighting health-care fraud,” Budetti said. “We’re lucky we have a system that encourages them to come forward.” Darren Sewell grew up in Champion, Ohio, a small city about forty minutes from Cleveland, the oldest of three boys. Their father, Rickye, ran a family company that made industrial switchgear and other manufacturing equipment; their mother, Barbara, was a stay-at-home mom when the kids were young, and then took a job in administration at a medical-supply company. Most of the Sewell boys’ free time was devoted to sports: Sewell played baseball, basketball, and varsity soccer, and was a competitive swimmer, eventually qualifying for nationals. Sewell was the academic star of the family and, according to his brother David, a magnanimous friend. “Darren didn’t care about material things,” David told me. “He drove around in a ratty car. But he never hesitated to buy everyone’s drinks, or to treat when we went out to dinner or on trips.” After graduating from high school, Sewell attended the University of Akron, and then earned his medical degree in an accelerated four-year program at Northeast Ohio Medical University. He did his residency at a hospital in downtown Orlando, and thrived in the adrenalized atmosphere of the emergency room. “In the E.R., you’ve got to be able to assess a patient really quickly, and figure out what’s wrong, handle that, and move on. He was so good at that,” David said. “He had stories: ‘I’ve got one finger plugging the guy’s heart from a gunshot wound and I’m making coffee with the other.’ ” Sewell saw a lot of trauma patients, and the work, though exciting, was draining. “The daily grind of being an E.R. doctor—he didn’t want to continue that,” David said. Sewell was also interested in business, and he eventually left emergency medicine; he spent a few years working at H.M.O.s before joining Freedom Health. The company was owned by Kiran C. Patel, a cardiologist who was born to South Asian parents in Zambia and immigrated to the U.S. in 1976. Patel was already an enormously successful entrepreneur. In the nineteen-nineties, he took over a struggling H.M.O. called WellCare, which he sold to a group of investors in 2002 for two hundred million dollars. He was the financial backer of a high-end oceanfront hotel and resort near Tampa, and an investor in the Tampa Bay Times. In 2007, he bought Freedom and a smaller company, called Optimum Healthcare, for fifty million dollars, and joined them under the umbrella of one parent company. Freedom had been a family operation, and Patel maintained the tradition, appointing relatives to important positions in the company. Freedom’s founder, Devaiah Pagidipati, was also a physician of Indian descent who had immigrated to the U.S. in the nineteen-seventies; his son, Siddhartha Pagidipati, a former investment banker known as Sidd, served as Freedom’s chief operating officer under Patel. Around the office, Patel was known as Dr. K. (Patel, Devaiah Pagidipati, Siddhartha Pagidipati, Freedom, and Optimum declined to comment for this article.) Patel was a high-profile figure in the Tampa area, due, in part, to his prolific philanthropy. Tampa’s conservatory building bears his name, and his wife, who is a pediatrician, sits on the board of the city’s center for the performing arts. The couple has sent money to India to rebuild a village and to establish schools, and has donated large sums to local colleges—the University of South Florida includes the Patel College of Global Sustainability—and to hospitals and other health ventures. Patel has spoken publicly about having a skin-pigmentation disorder called vitiligo, for which he has chosen not to seek treatment. “I have the respect of society, and my wife tells me that people love me for who I am,” Patel told a publication called Florida Trend, in 2017. Patel has gained particular notoriety for the private estate he is building in north Tampa, renderings of which have been printed in the local press. The residence will be a cross between the Taj Mahal and Versailles—a sixty-eight-thousand-square-foot palace with a fountain, a twelve-car garage, a Hindu temple, domed pavilions, and latticework made of red sandstone imported from Rajasthan. There will be separate buildings for Patel’s three grown children and their families, spread across seventeen acres that abut White Trout Lake, which is celebrated for its sunset views. The estate’s centerpiece is a grand ballroom. At Freedom, it was clear to Sewell that Patel wanted to expand quickly and then sell the company, as he had with WellCare. He seemed to have ambitious goals, such as quadrupling the number of members within three years. According to Sewell, the internal philosophy at Freedom was to keep costs low, to move swiftly, and to be aggressive. Medicare Advantage, on which Freedom’s business focussed, was part of a trend toward the privatization of health care. President Lyndon Johnson created the first national health-care program in 1965, after fierce political battles, when he signed the Social Security Act Amendments. The law established a fund to provide health-insurance coverage, known as Medicare, to Americans over the age of sixty-five, and to provide coverage to the poor through a sister program, Medicaid. “No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years,” Johnson said at the signing ceremony, in Independence, Missouri, noting that eighteen million Americans were seniors, many with low incomes. “No longer will young families see their own incomes, and their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents, and to their uncles, and their aunts.” Johnson gave the first Medicare card to former President Truman. There are currently sixty million seniors enrolled in Medicare, approximately eighteen per cent of the U.S. population, and the number is expected to rise to sixty-seven million by 2030. Medicare remains one of the most popular government programs. It has saved millions of people from financial ruin in old age, and, because of its importance to a crucial voting demographic, it has weathered decades of tax cuts and reductions to the social safety net. But the growing population of elderly Americans and the steep rise in the price of health-care services have spurred concern that Medicare could become insolvent; policymakers such as Paul Ryan, the former House Speaker, have argued that elderly citizens should receive vouchers to purchase health insurance on the open market, and there has been a push among certain lawmakers to privatize parts of the program. Traditional Medicare is structured as a fee-for-service program: the government pays fixed amounts to doctors and other health-care providers for each service. The system is straightforward—the more health care you provide, the more money you are paid—but easy to abuse. Malcolm Sparrow, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School and the author of “License to Steal: How Fraud Bleeds America’s Healthcare System,” told me, “Under the fee-for-service system, the financial incentives were always to overutilize and overbill, and, if you were a crook, to fabricate claims.” Medicare Advantage was supposed to mitigate the problem by harnessing the discipline of the private sector. In the nineteen-eighties, when health-care spending represented about nine per cent of the G.D.P. (the number is now eighteen per cent), President Reagan signed a bill that created an early version of the program. Medicare Advantage permits private health-insurance companies, including Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and United, to offer coverage to seniors under a new model: the companies receive a set amount of money from the government each month for each senior, and it is up to the companies to provide the prescribed coverage with the funds. “These were devices to make the health-care costs of the government more predictable and slower growing, and to shift the responsibility and accountability to a private entity whose entire well-being depended on prudent management,” Len Nichols, a professor of health policy at George Mason University, who served as a health-policy adviser during the Clinton Administration, told me. “Medicare Advantage is a long-standing part of the Republican strategy of privatizing Medicare.” The Advantage plans competed for patients with one another, and with traditional Medicare; they began offering perks such as health-club memberships, dental coverage, and rebates. And all this market competition would encourage better services and more preventive care, driving down costs. At least, that was the idea. Around the time that Darren Sewell joined Freedom, his brother David was living in Ohio, working at G.E. Aviation. He was an expert in Six Sigma, a system for improving efficiency, originally developed by Motorola, and Sewell encouraged him to move to Florida and apply those skills to the health-care industry. David made a presentation to Sidd Pagidipati, the Freedom C.O.O., and was hired as a consultant. One of David’s first assignments was to improve the company’s growing backlog of client calls. (The C.M.S. closely monitors how long Medicare Advantage providers place members who call in on hold.) I recently met with David at his home, in Tampa, where he lives with his partner, Sami, and two children, ages three and one. He is smaller than Sewell, athletic and tanned, with silvery hair and a sprinkling of stubble. He favors Florida-casual attire—khaki shorts and untucked button-down shirts—and seems to always have a stainless-steel canteen in his hand. He gets emotional when talking about his older brother, whom he described as fearless, the kind of person who would talk to anyone, and who frequently charmed women who seemed unlikely to pay attention to him. “It never ceased to amaze me,” David said. When David first moved to Florida, the brothers were both single and lived fifteen minutes apart. They met for early-morning swims and made weekend trips to the beach with Sewell’s eight-year-old daughter, whom he had part time, in a shared-custody arrangement with a former girlfriend. The brothers talked about almost everything. One evening, Sewell told David that he had observed troubling practices at Freedom. Sewell was the third-highest-ranking employee at the company; he helped lead the department that made clinical decisions and administered medical benefits to patients. He was privy to high-level corporate activity, and he sensed a general attitude of contempt toward the government. He believed that Freedom was intentionally rooting out sicker, more expensive enrollees by having sales agents target them and then encourage them to leave Freedom, an illegal practice known as “lemon-dropping.” He kept thinking of his grandmother, and how easy it would be for a salesperson to manipulate her. To David, Sewell described the company’s behavior as “brazen”; he had already done significant research into the process of filing a qui-tam complaint. At one point, he jumped up, pulled a book from his shelf, and handed it to David. “You have to read this,” Sewell said. The book, by John W. Schilling, was titled “Undercover: How I Went from Company Man to F.B.I. Spy—and Exposed the Worst Healthcare Fraud in U.S. History.” Schilling had been a mid-level accountant at Columbia/HCA Healthcare, a multistate hospital chain co-founded by the former Florida governor (and now senator) Rick Scott, in 1987. In 1994, shortly after starting work at the company, Schilling became convinced that it was routinely overbilling Medicare. He filed a qui-tam case and became an informant for the F.B.I. The case proceeded in secret for several years, as the government gathered evidence. Scott resigned from the company in 1997, four months after the investigation became public, and began his career in Republican politics. Ultimately, his company paid $1.7 billion in criminal and civil fines and penalties to settle a long list of charges, and two executives were convicted of fraud and sentenced to prison. Freedom was a much smaller enterprise, but Sewell felt that he had stumbled onto a similar case. He had already spoken with attorneys at Phillips & Cohen, the law firm that had represented Schilling. It seemed to him that each time the government’s health-care policies changed the private sector found new ways to maximize profit—even if, in some cases, it meant bending or breaking the rules. Medicare Advantage was just the latest example, and it was new enough that regulators and fraud investigators hadn’t yet figured out all the ways in which it could be gamed. Sewell’s imagination began to spin. “He loved James Bond movies. The aspect of wearing a wire really intrigued him,” David recalled. “There was one moment where he said, ‘Donnie Brasco’s got nothing on me,’ ” referring to an F.B.I. agent who infiltrated the Mafia and became the inspiration for a film. David recalled asking, “How the hell are you going to be able to pay an attorney?” Sewell explained that reputable lawyers in qui-tam cases usually work on a contingency basis: they take only those cases which they believe are solid, and are paid if the case is successful, typically getting forty per cent of the whistle-blower’s award. He suggested that David file the suit along with him. David hesitated. “I’m certainly more reserved and private than Darren was,” he told me. They talked about Patel; he was wealthy and well connected, and they couldn’t rule out the possibility that he or his allies would retaliate against them. “I had more concerns about the retaliation aspect,” David said. “This guy is held up in the medical community, the Indian community, he’s done this philanthropy stuff. He’s held in very high regard. For any individual to go against that, you’re not on equal footing.” David was also worried about exposing the rest of the family to a backlash if he and Sewell filed the case jointly. “If you’re already in this, and taking the fire, taking the bullets, is there value to me also coming under fire?” David said. “Not from a selfish standpoint. It was partly about the family—if he’s going to take all the fire for the family, do we really want others to come along?” David decided not to join the suit, and Sewell continued on his own. Mary Inman, who is now a partner at the law firm Constantine Cannon, had spent ten years representing whistle-blowers when her firm flew Darren Sewell to San Francisco to meet with her for the first time, in 2008. Inman is petite and lively, with wide brown eyes and wild dark hair. She has a tendency to smile brightly, even when she’s about to deliver unwelcome news. Her colleagues refer to her as the “whistle-blower whisperer.” She talks about serving as an informal therapist and parent to her clients during the lonely, multiyear process of developing a qui-tam case. Part of the purpose of the initial meeting, she told me, is to “size up” the potential client, to figure out whether he or she is trustworthy. She asks herself, “Do I really want to spend the next six years with this person?” Inman told me that, when Sewell walked into the room, she thought, “This guy is weird. He’s tall, he’s awkward, he’s got this eye thing going on.” But, she continued, “it sort of added to the mad-scientist bit. He was so impossibly intelligent.” She was soon won over by his self-deprecating humor, and described him as a “gentle giant.” Sewell told her that he believed Freedom was “cherry-picking”—recruiting healthy enrollees who needed little or no medical care—in addition to lemon-dropping. He said that the company had offered sales agents cash bonuses for getting seniors who required a lot of health care off Freedom’s insurance rolls. Inman told me that the behavior sounded “odious.” She said that, as the meeting with Sewell wore on, “it became very clear to me he knew exactly what he was doing. He was very intelligent and credible, and he knew he was in a fairly compromised position with some pretty questionable characters.” While Inman and her associates debated whether to take the case, Sewell sent her documents that he said would show how the company tracked sick patients and targeted them for disenrollment. He also shared a photograph of a conference table that Patel had installed in the office. The table was enormous, with a gleaming marble top. The faces of Patel, his wife, and his father were carved down the center and into the base, in a manner reminiscent of Mt. Rushmore. Inman also did her own research, which revealed that Patel’s first company, WellCare, had been raided by the F.B.I. several years after he sold it, during a Medicaid-fraud investigation; WellCare executives were eventually indicted, in 2011. Its former general counsel was later sentenced to six months in prison, and the company paid two hundred and twenty-seven million dollars to settle civil and criminal charges. (Patel was not implicated in the case.) Inman found Sewell refreshingly honest about the appeal of the potential financial rewards. “He was human,” she said. “I told my partners, ‘I like this guy, we’re going to bet on him. It may not turn into anything, but we’ll try.’ ” In a qui-tam case, a complaint is filed by the whistle-blower in secret, under seal, so that the government can conduct its own investigation without alerting the target. If federal prosecutors find the allegations credible, the Justice Department may decide to sign on as the lead plaintiff, which gives the case added heft and credibility. (The whistle-blower can also move forward on his or her own if the government declines.) Inman warned Sewell that being a whistle-blower would take a personal toll. He wouldn’t be able to talk about the case with anyone but his attorneys. Once the suit became public, he might be branded a traitor in the business community and have trouble finding another job. It would be lonely and stressful. But Sewell said that he wanted to proceed. For several months, Sewell went to work as he normally did. When he came home, he began his second shift, e-mailing spreadsheets and documents to Inman from his Gmail account and then spending hours on the phone with her, explaining what they meant. There was a sense of time pressure; if a different Freedom whistle-blower filed a complaint first, Sewell might not be able to participate in the resulting case. On August 17, 2009, he finally filed his complaint with the district court in Tampa, alleging that Freedom was manipulating enrollment rolls. The complaint also alleged that Freedom was engaging in service-area-expansion fraud—misrepresenting the number of health-care providers in its network in certain counties, so that it could expand the areas in which it offered Medicare Advantage. Sewell and Inman filed hundreds of pages of supporting documents, including internal e-mails, spreadsheets, and marketing files. Then they waited for a call from the U.S. Attorney’s office, which came a few weeks later. Randy Harwell, the chief of the civil division at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Tampa, told me that the biggest challenge his office faces when assessing a new complaint is determining the whistle-blower’s motives and figuring out whether there are inconsistencies in the story. “This is the busiest whistle-blower docket in the country,” Harwell told me. “We get all kinds in this office—crusaders, people who are just really upset, people who are just crooks themselves, frankly. It’s not uncommon at all for complete grifters to come in and pitch cases.” But Sewell, he said, was credible from the start. Sewell and Inman eventually presented fifty PowerPoint slides of evidence to Harwell and a group of other investigators. “All of life is a bell curve, and the whistle-blower docket is certainly a bell curve, and there’s wheat and there’s chaff,” Harwell said, and added that he remembered Sewell “being a very squared-away, knowledgeable guy. It seemed like he knew what he was talking about.” The next step was the government’s investigation. For more than a year, Sewell led a double life as an undercover agent, helping the government build its case. He became accustomed to a gruelling routine. Before work, he would meet Ed Ortega, the F.B.I. agent, in various parking lots—sometimes at a Catholic church or a motel, other times next to a Bank of America. Ortega would outfit Sewell with the wire. Then Sewell would go to work and record. A few hours later, he’d slip out to meet Ortega again to return the device, hoping that no one would notice his absence. It was critical that Sewell not discuss the investigation with anyone; if the seal was broken, Sewell was repeatedly warned, his role would be imperilled and he could get nothing. The only person potentially excluded from the circle of silence was a spouse; because Sewell wasn’t married, there was no one he could talk to. In 2010, while the investigation was under way, Sewell was moved to a different job at Freedom, in the Medicare-revenue-management department, where he reported to an executive named Mital Panara. In his new role, Sewell was exposed to a different side of the business, including the risk-adjustment department, which assigned Medicare Advantage enrollees codes that reflected their diagnoses. Certain codes and combinations of codes led to larger reimbursements from the government, and it was simple, with modest computer-programming skills, to figure out how to generate the most profitable codes based on the group of patients you had. Of course, companies were supposed to apply codes only to patients who actually had the corresponding conditions, as determined by a physician who had treated the patient. Sewell quickly noticed many coding inaccuracies, almost all of which were in the company’s favor, resulting in higher government payments. Sewell believed that Freedom was committing risk-adjustment fraud—instructing its internal coding auditors to scour medical records for places where the codes could be amplified, a practice known as “capturing” codes. Sometimes, he later alleged, Freedom pressured doctors to schedule unnecessary appointments and to assign additional codes that the internal data miners thought would be more profitable. Sewell also saw further evidence of the service-area-expansion fraud: Freedom was “renting” groups of doctors in various counties in order to gain C.M.S. approval to expand, and then dropping the doctors after receiving it. In one example that Sewell found, Freedom said that there would be six in-network oncologists in Duval County, a large county in Florida, but patients couldn’t find a single one. The company’s strategy seemed to be paying off: in 2009, Inc. named Freedom one of America’s fastest-growing companies. Sewell’s case was one of the first to show prosecutors and attorneys how Medicare Advantage could be defrauded. When, in January, 2011, a prospective whistle-blower named Benjamin Poehling contacted Inman’s law firm, Inman instantly understood what his allegations meant. “It was because of Darren that when Ben called me I was able to appreciate the gravity of what he was saying,” Inman told me. “Darren was our origin story of risk-adjustment fraud.” Poehling grew up in Bloomington, a suburb near Minneapolis. His father was a high-school social-studies teacher who also sold residential real estate, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. “My parents always surrounded me with positive role models,” Poehling told me recently. He attended a Catholic high school, and the family went to church every Sunday. He began playing golf at an early age, and the game helped shape his moral outlook. “Golf is a unique sport—you’re your own referee,” Poehling said. “One of the first times my dad introduced me to golf, he said, ‘Look, Ben, golf is very different from other things in life. No one is policing you. You are writing down your own scores. You’ll have multiple opportunities to cheat.’ His one rule was that you always follow the rules.” Poehling graduated from Drake University, in Iowa, in 1998, with a degree in actuarial science and finance, and then joined Arthur Andersen, a multinational accounting firm, as a consultant. In 2002, Arthur Andersen, which was embroiled in the Enron scandal, split apart. Poehling went to work for a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which had been one of his clients at Arthur Andersen. (United’s current and former C.E.O.s are also alumni of Arthur Andersen.) Around the time that Sewell joined Freedom, Poehling was working with United’s risk-adjustment and Medicare Advantage teams. I met with Poehling in Bloomington, where he lives with his wife and three young children. He said that, over time, he realized that it wouldn’t be difficult to steal from Medicare Advantage. “The risk-adjustment system, it’s essentially an honor system,” Poehling told me. “It’s very similar to golf.” Poehling was disturbed by what he described as a chart-review program at United, in which the company systematically went through hundreds of thousands of medical records, searching for places to increase the diagnosis codes in order to make patients appear sicker. In some cases, legitimate codes had been left out and needed to be added. But, according to Poehling’s allegations, the system was set up primarily to find opportunities for increases, and designed not to delete inappropriate codes. United had an aggressive internal culture, he said, with bonuses for executives who raised reimbursement numbers. In a 2007 e-mail provided to the Justice Department, the former C.F.O. of the group that managed United’s Medicare Advantage plans wrote to an executive at a data-analytics subsidiary, “Wanted to get together with you and discuss what we can do in the short term and long term to really go after the potential risk scoring you have consistently indicated is out there. . . . You mentioned vasculatory disease opportunities, screening opportunities, etc with huge $ opportunities. Lets turn on the gas! What can we do to make sure we are being reimbursed fairly for the members and risk we take on more than what we are currently doing.” Poehling said that he briefly considered quitting his job, but decided that that would be unprincipled. He mulled over his other options. He could raise his concerns with United’s board of directors, but there was no way to be sure that they would take action. He could send an anonymous complaint to the C.M.S., but he didn’t know if the agency had the resources to pursue his case. (The limited C.M.S. budget can make it challenging for the organization to police fraud.) Filing a qui-tam complaint was personally risky, but at least it insured that the allegations would be investigated. “I’m sitting in this situation, and I don’t know if what United is doing is illegal or not. I’m not a lawyer,” Poehling said. “But it went against all the principles I had been taught and had lived by my entire life.” Poehling said that the size of the alleged fraud made the matter urgent. “I would not have done this if this were a ten-million-dollar issue or a five-million-dollar issue, or if it were just limited to one part of the company,” he said. “But that wasn’t the case. This was potentially a multibillion-dollar issue. The scale of it was huge. And this was known for many years at the highest levels at the largest health-care company in this country.” (In a statement, a UnitedHealthcare spokesperson wrote, “Our company followed the Medicare Advantage program rules, and has been transparent with the government about our approach.” The spokesperson added that the C.M.S. “has continued to accept our bids and pays us under our contracts.”) Poehling spent the next several months collecting documents and evidence, and, on March 24, 2011, he filed a qui-tam complaint. In the summer of 2010, Freedom hired a nurse and coding specialist to conduct a mock audit of its diagnosis data in order to prepare for a possible audit by the government. According to evidence that Sewell gathered, the specialist found that approximately eighty per cent of the diagnosis codes in the company’s records were unjustified—a shocking number. When the specialist reported the results to Panara, Sewell alleged, he asked her to assess the codes more “leniently.” (Panara denies this.) Medicare regulations dictate that Freedom should have reported the invalid codes to the government and reimbursed it for millions of dollars in overpayments, but, according to Sewell, the company never did so. (In a statement, Panara’s lawyer wrote, “Panara did nothing to violate the False Claims Act or any federal regulations,” adding that he “Admitted no wrongdoing and suffered no personal penalties” in the case.) After more than ten months, the government prosecutors were still unsure whether they had sufficient evidence to join Sewell’s case. They kept asking him to get more. “He liked the cloak-and-dagger stuff,” Inman told me. “At the start, everyone is kind of flattered. It’s kind of exciting. He would joke about it, humor was his device.” But, as the investigation dragged on through 2011 and into 2012, the novelty wore off and the stress started to weigh heavily on Sewell. He worried that Freedom would discover his actions and blacklist him in the industry, and that the legal case would fall apart. He also worried that he would implicate innocent or lower-tier employees through his indiscriminate taping. He became increasingly short-tempered and distracted. “Some days, you could just see the stress on him,” David said. “When he was under stress, his eye would deviate. I saw him every day, and I could tell something was going on.” Even Ortega seemed frustrated by the government’s lack of momentum. Finally, in the spring of 2012, in a bid to move the investigation forward, Ortega decided to approach Panara and attempt to persuade him to flip. It was a risky move—if Panara said no, he might alert the rest of Freedom’s senior management to the investigation. Ortega approached Panara after a conference and confronted him with comments that Sewell had recorded—comments that, from their context, likely made it clear that Sewell was the government’s source. Panara refused to coöperate. The government rushed to send subpoenas to Freedom. Finally, two and a half years after Sewell had launched the case, Freedom executives knew that they were under investigation. The next day, Patel called an emergency meeting and instructed employees not to destroy documents or other evidence. Then Freedom launched its own inquiry into the fraud. Inman told me that this type of internal investigation is often intended in part to identify which employees, if any, have been coöperating with the government. (The law prohibits companies from retaliating against whistle-blowers, but punitive actions are nevertheless common.) Company attorneys began interviewing employees. When it was Sewell’s turn, he declined to answer certain questions, and instead responded as Inman had coached him: “I want to help you. I’m a coöperating witness in a federal investigation. And I’m represented by counsel.” It would have been imprudent for Freedom to fire Sewell, but the revelation that he had become a whistle-blower marked the beginning of a swift and painful series of events. Within a few days, according to allegations in his complaint, Sewell was locked out of his office computer. His access was restored, but a few days later he discovered that his personal laptop had disappeared from his bag while he was out of his office for a few minutes. Sewell panicked. Anyone in the Freedom office could have taken the computer, which likely contained many of his communications with his lawyers, and also the presentation that he and Inman had given to government prosecutors. The laptop was never recovered. In April of 2012, Freedom placed Sewell on administrative leave; in September, he submitted his “involuntary resignation.” Later that fall, while he was at home looking for a new job, Sewell heard that his former employers were telling others in the industry to avoid working with him. Former colleagues also told Sewell that Freedom executives had claimed that he was responsible for the fraud—that he had filed the whistle-blower complaint to punish the company for failing to promote him. It was no surprise, then, when Sewell had trouble finding a new position in the clubby Florida Medicare-insurance industry. Each time he seemed close to getting an offer, the job would suddenly fall through. Sewell resisted the idea of moving out of the state, since he wanted to stay close to his daughter. And the government still hadn’t made a decision about whether to join his case. Everything was on hold. In a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine, in 2010, a group of researchers studied how the qui-tam process affects whistle-blowers in major health-care-fraud cases. The study’s subjects reported feeling intense pressure while coöperating with the government, and said that the cases created high workloads. They expressed frustration with how slowly the investigations moved and with how little information prosecutors shared with them. They reported anxiety and uncertainty that lasted for years, and some spoke of being threatened, of losing their jobs, and of being blocked from new employment. A few of the comments were particularly telling. One interviewee, in response to a question about what advice he would give a potential whistle-blower, wrote, “[Can they] afford 5 years of their life in turmoil?” Another said, “Part of your ability to do anything about this is keeping yourself together,” and suggested that whistle-blowers find someone “like a minister or a shrink who’s confidentiality-protected,” because “this could go on for a while.” A high proportion of whistle-blowers reported divorces or other marital strain, family conflicts, and stress-related health issues including shingles, autoimmune disorders, panic attacks, insomnia, and migraines. Several of them said that the financial consequences were devastating. “Honestly, I would not advise anybody to do it,” one said. In mid-2013, Sewell was still without a steady income, and he had begun digging into his savings to pay the bills. “He was going broke,” David told me. “He liquidated I.R.A.s and his retirement accounts.” He became increasingly depressed; he gained weight, then lost it again. Inman recalled telling Sewell, one night on the phone, about the severe postpartum depression that she had experienced. “I know what you’re going through. I’ve been at the bottom of the well,” she told him. “I’m asking you—as your lawyer and your friend—you need to stay with us.” Sewell’s fortunes appeared to take a turn when he was hired as a consultant by a midsized physicians’ group. But, a few weeks into the job, he was told, with little explanation, that the position had ended and that he should leave. Sewell was devastated. He felt certain that his former employers had learned about his new job and intervened. “It felt like there was an optimism there,” Inman said. “And, when it happened again, it was different. You could just see, it was defeatism. And I just felt like that was it.” “That was the one that really just crushed him,” David said. Sewell told other family members, “They got me. They got me good this time.” David suggested that the two of them go on a beach vacation or a fishing trip, so that Sewell could think about something else. Sewell agreed that that was a good idea. A few days later, in early September, 2014, Sewell was rushed to the hospital with a serious head injury after an accidental fall inside his house. Medical personnel found a clot in his brain. After three days in the hospital, Sewell died, at the age of thirty-nine. Amid the shock and grief, David was informed that, as the executor of his brother’s estate, he would have to take Sewell’s place as the whistle-blower in order for the Freedom case to proceed. He was stunned to learn the extent of what Sewell had uncovered. David was planning to get married, and he had concerns about taking on such powerful adversaries. But, if he didn’t do it, the case would be terminated, and everything Sewell had gone through would be for nothing. There was very little left in Sewell’s estate for his daughter—except, potentially, his portion of the fraud recovery. David agreed to stand in as the whistle-blower. According to Malcolm Sparrow, of Harvard, unchecked fraud could lead to the wholesale destruction of government health-care programs. Systemic theft creates cost inflation, he explained, which increases political pressure to make cuts, often affecting both the healthy and the unhealthy parts of a program. “That’s going to translate in one way or another to less medical treatment when it’s needed, and clear incentives for the insurance companies to provide poorer-quality care,” Sparrow said. “Indiscriminate cost cutting hurts the honest people more than the dishonest. If you just cut reimbursement rates, they’ll just bill more. They’re not constrained by the truth.” If politicians don’t learn to discriminate between fraud and legitimate activity, Sparrow warned, “this will grow like a cancer and destroy your program.” In February, 2017, the government announced that it was joining Benjamin Poehling’s case against United. United has denied the charges and is fighting vigorously against them in court. The company filed a motion to dismiss the case, and, last February, a judge granted the motion for some of the claims but allowed a central allegation—that United had failed to correct diagnosis codes that it knew were false—to move forward. In its defense, the company cites a principle known as actuarial equivalence, which requires that the government treat Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans equally. United argues in court filings that the C.M.S. “does not delete or otherwise account for the unsupported diagnosis codes . . . when it is calculating risk scores for its traditional Medicare enrollees,” and that, as a result, requiring Medicare Advantage plans to delete unsupported codes without making traditional Medicare do the same violates actuarial equivalence. Poehling left the company in 2012, before the case became public, and feels fortunate to have found another job. After our interview in Bloomington, Poehling and I took a drive. We circled United’s headquarters, a cluster of mirrored buildings in Minnetonka, just west of Minneapolis. We also visited Edina, an affluent area where many United executives live. We passed country clubs and grand houses surrounded by rolling lawns. It was late fall, and the streets were blanketed in golden leaves. Poehling noted that United’s stock had performed spectacularly in recent years. “If you ask any health-care executive now, one of the driving forces in their business is government health-care programs,” he said. He seemed dubious that Medicare Advantage was working as intended. “A lot of enrollees get free gym memberships, free dental care. They get all these things you don’t get with fee-for-service Medicare. When people say, ‘Well, how do these private companies do it, how do they fund it?’ Well, this is how they fund it!” he said. “The fundamental question is, does Medicare Advantage really save the government money?” In 2016, seven years after Darren Sewell filed his case, the Justice Department informed Inman that it would join the suit. In May of 2017, after months of difficult negotiations, Freedom settled charges that it had violated the False Claims Act and agreed to pay $31.7 million. Freedom’s former chief operating officer, Sidd Pagidipati, paid seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to settle charges related to his role in the alleged service-area-expansion fraud. Neither admitted liability. The whistle-blower’s share of the recovery, $6.4 million, will be split between Sewell’s estate and his attorneys. The company paid another $2.3 million for Sewell’s attorneys’ fees. Inman recently moved to London, which is a top source of American whistle-blower lawsuits outside the U.S., to build a new practice for her firm there. Five months after the Freedom settlement, Patel announced that he was selling Freedom’s parent company to Anthem, the second-largest insurance firm in the country, reportedly for more than a billion dollars. That year, Florida Trend named Patel “Floridian of the Year.” He told the publication that he was planning to dedicate his time to philanthropy. When asked about the Freedom fine, he responded, “I decided to take it as a cost of doing business.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Kyrsten Sinema’s Victory in Arizona May Be the Democrats’ Biggest Win of the Trump Era,7397,"With the ongoing electoral drama in Florida, the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema’s come-from-behind win in the Arizona race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the Republican Jeff Flake, which was confirmed on Monday night, hasn’t received the attention it deserves. Sinema’s victory was arguably the biggest win for Democrats since Donald Trump was elected. (In last December’s special election in Alabama, the Republicans ran an unelectable candidate.) It puts a different gloss on the results of the midterms. And it has important implications for 2020 and beyond. Last Tuesday night, as the early returns came in, it seemed like the Democrats were heading for a narrow victory in the House and the Republicans were on course for a decisive win in the Senate. Donald Trump and other Republicans quickly seized on this narrative, which emerged before the number of Democratic pickups in the House became clear—the figure is now thirty-two, and may well go higher—and also before the results came in from Senate races in Nevada, where the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen defeated the Republican incumbent Dean Heller by five percentage points, and Montana, where the embattled Democratic incumbent Jon Tester fought off a strong challenge from the Republican Matt Rosendale. Now Sinema’s triumph has been added to the mix. Setting aside Florida, where there is a recount under way, the score in Senate-seat pickups is Republicans, 3, Democrats, 2. The G.O.P. gains all came in states where Trump scored huge victories in 2016: Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. In states that Trump carried by less than fifteen percentage points or that Hillary Clinton won, the pickups tally is Republicans, 0, Democrats, 2. (If the Republican Rick Scott holds on in Florida, the score will be Republicans, 1, Democrats, 2.) This is a more nuanced picture. It suggests that, though Trump can still rally his followers very effectively in deep-red (or, rather, deep-Trump) states, his polarizing style doesn’t necessarily play well in other areas that Republicans have traditionally relied on. And Arizona is one of those places. For the past fifty years, Arizona has been a redoubt of the Sun Belt conservatism—pro-business, anti-taxes—that Barry Goldwater pioneered. Occasionally, moderate Democrats like Bruce Babbitt and Janet Napolitano have held statewide office. But Sinema is the first Democrat to be elected to the Senate from Arizona since 1988, and the first Democrat to win an open Senate seat in the state since Dennis DeConcini was elected, in 1976. The firsts don’t stop there. Sinema, a forty-two-year-old congresswoman for Arizona’s Ninth District, will also be the first female senator from Arizona, and the first openly bisexual senator from anywhere. Her margin of victory was a narrow one—about thirty-eight thousand votes, or 1.7 percentage points—but she won fair and square. Last week, Trump cried “corruption” as Sinema caught up to and surpassed the vote tally of her G.O.P. opponent, Martha McSally, a fifty-two-year-old congresswoman, who represents Arizona’s Second District. McSally made no such claim. On the day of the election, hundreds of thousands of early votes were dropped off at polling places, and each of them had to be checked individually to make sure the signature matched the one on file. Most of these turned out to be Democratic votes. On Monday night, McSally posted a video in which she congratulated Sinema and said, “I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Like Nevada, Arizona is often cited as a state in which long-term demographic change, particularly the growing number of Latino residents, is favoring Team Blue. Right now, though, Arizona contains a lot more registered Republicans than Democrats, and Sinema’s electoral strategy reflected this fact. The demographic transition “is happening, but it’s not why Sinema won,” Andy Barr, a political consultant who has represented numerous Arizona Democrats, told me on Tuesday morning. “She won by running an extremely disciplined campaign focussing on what we call the swing demographic—college-educated women in the suburbs.” As the Republicans sought to portray her as a tutu-wearing radical—back in 2000, she worked on Ralph Nader’s Presidential campaign—Sinema came out against two policies popular with progressives: Medicare for all and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In September, she supported a G.O.P. proposal in the House to extend the personal tax cuts that were introduced in last year’s tax-reform bill, which she opposed at the time. But she also talked a lot about traditional Democratic issues, such as health care and Social Security, and also emphasized her role in serving constituents in the Ninth District. “She portrayed herself as someone who gets things done and doesn’t get caught up in the partisan B.S.,” Barr said. By campaigning as a moderate willing to cross party lines, Sinema attracted support from suburbanites and self-identified independents. She also exposed the fault line in the Arizona G.O.P., which is divided between the old-line Party establishment, which Flake and John McCain embodied, and a seething base of Trump supporters. Initially, McSally tried to straddle this divide, but she ended up embracing the President and his inflammatory policies. Appearing alongside him at a rally last month, she said, “America is back—and Arizona is back—thanks to the leadership of President Trump.” But McSally was defeated despite gaining Trump’s endorsement. Looking forward to 2020, this outcome won’t be lost on strategists from both parties. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried Arizona by a healthy margin of nine percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by just 3.5 points, despite the fact that her campaign didn’t make Arizona a high priority until late in the campaign. “Any Democrat running for President in 2020 would be dumb not to invest early in Arizona,” Barr said. Sinema’s triumph also sets the stage for a debate inside the Democratic Party about how to win red states in the Trump era. In Texas, Beto O’Rourke ran a barnstorming progressive campaign and came up just short. Despite alienating some progressive activists, Sinema hedged her way to the U.S. Senate. “There was some whining about that, but we were so hungry for a win that the Democratic coalition wasn’t complaining much,” Barr said. In politics, as in sports, winning covers up a lot of sins. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"As Trump Tweets and Brian Kemp Declares Victory in Georgia, the Stacey Abrams Campaign Is Chasing Ballots",6892,"On Friday morning, ten people sat at tables in a fluorescent-lit room in a strip mall in Decatur, Georgia, east of Atlanta, making phone calls. On the walls, posters featuring Barack Obama and slogans like “Get Out the Vote!” hung next to sheets of paper on which people had scrawled personal reasons for voting for Stacey Abrams for governor of Georgia, such as “Affordable quality healthcare!” and “Kemp is literally a white supremacist.” Brian Kemp, the Republican in this year’s governor’s race, declared victory on Wednesday afternoon. Out of nearly four million votes cast, he has a lead of roughly sixty thousand, putting him just above the fifty-per-cent threshold required to avoid a runoff. Until Thursday morning, he was Georgia’s secretary of state, and was thus responsible for overseeing the election. He resigned shortly before a scheduled hearing in a lawsuit seeking his recusal. (The outgoing governor, Nathan Deal, a Republican, appointed Robyn Crittenden, a longtime ally, to take Kemp’s place. A lawyer for the nonprofit Protect Democracy, which represented five Georgia plaintiffs in the suit, called Kemp’s resignation a “huge victory.”) Other lawsuits have also been filed, one of them concerned with the paucity of voting machines at certain polling locations, and another focussed on a Georgia county where the delivery of absentee ballots was delayed by Hurricane Michael. Yet another lawsuit addressed polling locations where voters were pushed to use provisional ballots. Provisional ballots were also the focus at the strip mall in Decatur. As Kemp prepared for his transition—and, perhaps, privately, the legal battles seeking to delay or even deny it—the Abrams campaign set up seven offices around the state where staffers and volunteers were “chasing provisional ballots,” which are typically offered to voters who are unable to sufficiently prove their identities at the time of voting. (President Trump, perhaps unaware that not all votes are counted at the same time, tweeted, on Friday morning, “You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia—but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!”) According to an unofficial list compiled by the secretary of state’s office, 21,190 provisional ballots remain at play, along with a few thousand absentee ballots. If those are all the votes that remain, Abrams would need to receive nearly every last one of them to force a recount or a runoff. (The Kemp campaign has contended that even that would not be enough, an argument that Kemp’s press secretary, Cody Hall, reiterated to me on Friday: “Math hasn’t changed there.”) The deadline for certifying provisional ballots cast in the election was 5 p.m. on Friday—though, in some counties, it would be extended by a few hours. As the deadline approached, Abrams’s staff and supporters were trying to make sure that they didn’t miss any. Carol O’Regan, a physical therapist in her forties, sat at one table in Decatur, by herself, with coffee and a notebook. She wore a headset as she dialled numbers provided to her by the Abrams campaign, leaving message after message. “Hi, this is Carol calling from the Stacey Abrams campaign,” she said. “We understand that you had to cast a provisional ballot during the election. We just want to try to help you get that cleared up today, by 5 p.m. If you could give our voter hotline a call.” She listed the number. “Thanks so much and have a great day!” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media During a quick break, O’Regan said, “This is the first time I‘ve phone-banked. I’ll use the script if anyone picks up. For the messages, I just make my own thing up.” An hour into her effort, a man named Lloyd, in Gwinnett County, answered his phone. O’Regan straightened to attention. “We want to make sure your vote is counted,” she told him. “We just need a little more information.” She went on talking to Lloyd, while looking at voter information on her phone. It appeared, at first, that Lloyd wasn’t registered to vote, based on the notation that a poll worker had included on his provisional ballot. “We’d love to help you figure this out,” she said. A few minutes later, O’Regan discovered on the secretary of state’s Web site that Lloyd was, in fact, registered. “I think we need you to go to the office with your I.D.,” O’Regan told him. “Are you able to do that today?” She gave him the address in Gwinnett. “I believe you have an extended deadline today,” she said. “But I would go by five, just in case. We’ll give you a ride there if you need it. Let me know. We want your vote counted.” She paused. “You’re going now? O.K., great. Thanks, Lloyd. We’ll see ya.” After O’Regan got off the phone, an Abrams campaign staffer went over and gave her a high five. Another volunteer clapped from across the room. Nan Orrock, a state senator working in support of Abrams, reminisced about earlier efforts in pursuit of suffrage and civil rights. “I marched on Washington in 1963,” she said. “I’ve been chased by the Klan, had crosses burned in my yard, freedom houses burned up. This fight for the vote, it’s not a plaything. It’s dead serious.” O’Regan, nodding, recapped the call. “He told me, ‘I don’t typically answer calls that I don’t recognize,’ ” she said. “But he decided to answer this one, which was so funny. And then he said, ‘I voted for Stacey.’ I was, like, ‘That’s not really why we’re calling, but it is why we’re calling.’ He said he had an absentee ballot, which is why they wouldn’t let him vote or something. But I’m not really sure that’s why. It’s something to do with his registration. But he’s registered. It’s on the Web site. So I told him to go in person—I think that’s what the script was telling me.” She added, “He’s getting in the car and going. He said, ‘If people out there waited eighteen hours to vote, I can do it.’ ” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Goodbye to Juul Season,11239,"In March, while reporting a feature about vaping, I interviewed a Cornell junior named Jason Jeong, who had written a college newspaper column called “The Juul Manifesto.” A tongue-in-cheek tribute to the irony-steeped habits of today’s young people, the piece celebrated the paradox of a generation that can pronounce the phrase “açai bowl” but made a meme out of eating Tide Pods. Juuling—what people under the age of thirty or so call vaping, thanks to the industry-dominating success of the independent, San Francisco-based company—was almost definitely a terrible decision, Jeong wrote. “But let’s not forget this time of youthful ignorance and how incredible it was to own an e-cigarette in 2018.” That era seems to be ending. Last month, Jeong published a follow-up column, called “Juul Season Is Over.” In it, he wrote that “no analysis or criticism of our collective fervor for the Juul will ever be as compelling as the fact that we have all become addicted to nicotine.” It was time, he added, to “address the Juul as what it is: the public health crisis of our generation.” In the past six months, things have changed rapidly for Juul. The company’s valuation rose to sixteen billion dollars over the summer; it now controls nearly three-quarters of the e-cigarette market in the U.S. At the same time, it remains at the mercy of the Food and Drug Administration, which has regulated tobacco products since 2009. Scott Gottlieb, the current head of the F.D.A., has reiterated that “there’s a continuum of risk” when it comes to nicotine, and that there is a public interest in keeping safer cigarette alternatives on the market. But the agency is under intense pressure to crack down on vapes. (San Francisco recently passed the most restrictive ban on flavored tobacco products in the country. Juul, in the meantime, has hired lobbyists and ramped up its political spending.) In September, the F.D.A. gave Juul a sixty-day deadline to prove that it could keep its products away from young people. On Tuesday, Juul announced that it will no longer sell its flavored pods—each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes—in retail stores. Mint, tobacco, and menthol pods will still be available in vape shops and convenience stores; mango, mixed fruit, crème brûlée, and cucumber will only be sold on its Web site. In most states, you can buy e-cigarettes at eighteen, but you have to be twenty-one to use Juul’s online store, and buying Juul pods legally on the Internet can be as tricky as voting in Georgia: Juul employees manually check driver’s licenses and public records for exact matches, and end up rejecting quite a few actual adults from making purchases. According to the Times, the company is nixing forty-five per cent of its brick-and-mortar sales by cutting flavors—although Juul also said that it would eventually reinstate flavored pods at stores with vetted age-verification technology. On Thursday, the F.D.A. announced that stores would be permitted to continue selling flavored e-cigarettes in areas cordoned off from minors. “A curtain won’t cut it,” Gottlieb said. Vaping comes with a built-in public-health dilemma, which The Atlantic recently referred to as a “mango-flavored trolley problem.” Though cigarette smoking is now widely frowned upon by the young and the wealthy, it still causes nearly five hundred thousand deaths each year. For regular smokers who would like to quit but have not been able to, vaping can be a godsend. (Long-term data is not yet available on vaping’s side effects, but the habit is almost certainly much safer than smoking cigarettes.) But for young people who have never smoked before, vaping is a quick path to nicotine dependency. And this population—the high-school and college kids who hate cigarettes but may really love Juuling—is the primary object of the F.D.A.’s concern. In September, shortly before the agency raided Juul’s headquarters, leaving with more than a thousand documents about the company’s marketing practices, Gottlieb stated that the F.D.A. “won’t tolerate a whole generation of young people becoming addicted to nicotine as a trade-off for enabling adults to have unfettered access to these same products.” With that in mind, Juul, on Tuesday, also shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts. The company has always maintained that it has never intentionally advertised to teen-agers—and, in fact, for awhile now its advertising has been deliberately staid. But Juul never really needed to deliberately market its wares to teens. They make a social-media-friendly, pocket-size device full of a highly addictive substance: teen-agers have been happy to advertise Juul to one another, unpaid. When I was reporting my vaping piece this past spring, viral Juul accounts were all over Instagram, several of them more popular than the official account, @Juulvapor. Juul styles itself as a sort of Silicon Valley health-technology company, and it is eager to prove, as the C.E.O., Kevin Burns, asserted on Tuesday, that “preventing youth from initiating on nicotine” is a goal it shares with the F.D.A. It has been surprisingly successful in getting Instagram to take down Juul content—all the unofficial accounts that I followed when I was reporting the piece vanished months ago. The remaining #juulgang accounts have, at most, only a few thousand followers, and they are seedier and less funny than they used to be: lots of boob videos and spammy hashtags, no more vibrantly stupid memes. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Popcorn and Vaping Have in Common It’s possible that Juul’s cultural currency among young people had already peaked before the recent crackdown, though it will be a while before we know for sure: the National Youth Tobacco Survey, administered yearly, produces data that, by the time it comes out, is already a little outdated—on teen-trend time, at least. (What has been released so far of the 2018 data shows a significant increase, over the previous year, in monthly users, but there is no data yet from the past few months.) “The social media fanfare has died down,” Jason Jeong wrote to me in an e-mail. I texted Katie McCracken, a sophomore at the University of Virginia—whose mint Juul I once sampled in a campus library, for research—and asked if she thought the flavor ban would have an effect. “I don’t think kids are going to keep Juuling if they have to do tobacco or menthol,” she replied. She thought the Juul trend was fading out, anyway. “I definitely don’t Juul as much as I used to. At this point the people who are really addicted to nicotine will keep using it, but the people who do it casually, especially kids, will probably stop.” I called up another young woman, Kate, from Houston, who had previously told me about her high school’s bustling Juul-pod black market. Her classmates had caught word, last week, that Juul was likely to stop selling flavored pods in brick-and-mortar locations. “I know a lot of kids have been stocking up, if you will,” Kate said. “People are also saving empty pods to refill with juice from actual mod vapes, so they can sell them.” “Mod” here means modified: it is possible, if tricky, to refill a Juul pod with other flavored nicotine liquid. For now, it also remains pretty easy for teens to buy bootleg or knockoff Juul pods, and it seems likely that the sketchy knockoff-pod business will soar, and that other teen-friendly vapes, like the Suorin and the Phix, will become more popular. (The “Juul dealer” markup at local middle and high schools also seems liable to increase: anecdotally, the majority of underage Juulers buy their pods from other kids.) Kate, like almost every young person I’ve spoken to about this topic, didn’t think that her peers would start smoking cigarettes, no matter how much they were hooked on nicotine. And I suspect that a meaningful portion of casual Juulers will, without easy access to flavored pods, lose interest. But a casual Juuler becomes a habitual one very quickly. “Most of my friends who bought the Juul for occasional stress relief now can’t leave their apartments without it in their pocket,” Jeong told me. I can also imagine being a young Juuler and switching from mango pods to mint pods, or maybe to tobacco. In terms of flavor, the jump to cigarettes gets shorter from there. Juul’s changes may also have consequences for adult ex-smokers. As Jim McDonald, who writes for the Web site Vaping360, noted on Tuesday, “Tricky teenagers will always find a way to buy adult products. But many older adults—especially poor ones—won’t jump through JUUL’s high-tech hoops to try their best products. However, buying a pack of Marlboros will remain as easy as it ever was.” Several of my friends who used mango Juul pods to quit smoking cigarettes panicked about the company’s announcement that they would restrict retail sales: if you can’t sign for packages during the workday then you can’t easily buy Juul pods from the company Web site, because you technically have to verify your age in person in order to take a delivery of products containing nicotine. And another Juul problem seems to be emerging. There are many adults who, like me, bummed a lot of cigarettes when they were young and stressed or drinking but, when they got older, either mostly or completely stopped. I don’t have any data on this, but, after six months of routinely finding myself talking to strangers about vaping, I would bet my weight in pods that a lot of formerly casual smokers in their late twenties, thirties, and forties have developed a new Juul habit—and that, like many former heavy smokers, they often take in much more nicotine through vaping than they ever did with cigarettes. It is good, regardless, that Juul Season may be over for a lot of young people. It would be ideal if Juul took a dramatic downslide toward the land of the old and uncool. Still, there is something strange, and tragic, and ultra-American, about the fact that, in many states, it will be harder for an eighteen-year-old to buy a mango Juul pod than to buy a gun.

Why Doctors Hate Their Computers,54335,"On a sunny afternoon in May, 2015, I joined a dozen other surgeons at a downtown Boston office building to begin sixteen hours of mandatory computer training. We sat in three rows, each of us parked behind a desktop computer. In one month, our daily routines would come to depend upon mastery of Epic, the new medical software system on the screens in front of us. The upgrade from our home-built software would cost the hospital system where we worked, Partners HealthCare, a staggering $1.6 billion, but it aimed to keep us technologically up to date. More than ninety per cent of American hospitals have been computerized during the past decade, and more than half of Americans have their health information in the Epic system. Seventy thousand employees of Partners HealthCare—spread across twelve hospitals and hundreds of clinics in New England—were going to have to adopt the new software. I was in the first wave of implementation, along with eighteen thousand other doctors, nurses, pharmacists, lab techs, administrators, and the like. The surgeons at the training session ranged in age from thirty to seventy, I estimated—about sixty per cent male, and one hundred per cent irritated at having to be there instead of seeing patients. Our trainer looked younger than any of us, maybe a few years out of college, with an early-Justin Bieber wave cut, a blue button-down shirt, and chinos. Gazing out at his sullen audience, he seemed unperturbed. I learned during the next few sessions that each instructor had developed his or her own way of dealing with the hostile rabble. One was encouraging and parental, another unsmiling and efficient. Justin Bieber took the driver’s-ed approach: You don’t want to be here; I don’t want to be here; let’s just make the best of it. I did fine with the initial exercises, like looking up patients’ names and emergency contacts. When it came to viewing test results, though, things got complicated. There was a column of thirteen tabs on the left side of my screen, crowded with nearly identical terms: “chart review,” “results review,” “review flowsheet.” We hadn’t even started learning how to enter information, and the fields revealed by each tab came with their own tools and nuances. But I wasn’t worried. I’d spent my life absorbing changes in computer technology, and I knew that if I pushed through the learning curve I’d eventually be doing some pretty cool things. In 1978, when I was an eighth grader in Ohio, I built my own four-kilobyte computer from a mail-order kit, learned to program in basic, and was soon playing the arcade game Pong on our black-and-white television set. The next year, I got a an Apple II computer and eventually became the first kid in my school to turn in a computer-printed essay (and, shortly thereafter, the first to ask for an extension “because the computer ate my homework”). As my Epic training began, I expected my patience to be rewarded in the same way. My hospital had, over the years, computerized many records and processes, but the new system would give us one platform for doing almost everything health professionals needed—recording and communicating our medical observations, sending prescriptions to a patient’s pharmacy, ordering tests and scans, viewing results, scheduling surgery, sending insurance bills. With Epic, paper lab-order slips, vital-signs charts, and hospital-ward records would disappear. We’d be greener, faster, better. But three years later I’ve come to feel that a system that promised to increase my mastery over my work has, instead, increased my work’s mastery over me. I’m not the only one. A 2016 study found that physicians spent about two hours doing computer work for every hour spent face to face with a patient—whatever the brand of medical software. In the examination room, physicians devoted half of their patient time facing the screen to do electronic tasks. And these tasks were spilling over after hours. The University of Wisconsin found that the average workday for its family physicians had grown to eleven and a half hours. The result has been epidemic levels of burnout among clinicians. Forty per cent screen positive for depression, and seven per cent report suicidal thinking—almost double the rate of the general working population. Something’s gone terribly wrong. Doctors are among the most technology-avid people in society; computerization has simplified tasks in many industries. Yet somehow we’ve reached a point where people in the medical profession actively, viscerally, volubly hate their computers. On May 30, 2015, the Phase One Go-Live began. My hospital and clinics reduced the number of admissions and appointment slots for two weeks while the staff navigated the new system. For another two weeks, my department doubled the time allocated for appointments and procedures in order to accommodate our learning curve. This, I discovered, was the real reason the upgrade cost $1.6 billion. The software costs were under a hundred million dollars. The bulk of the expenses came from lost patient revenues and all the tech-support personnel and other people needed during the implementation phase. In the first five weeks, the I.T. folks logged twenty-seven thousand help-desk tickets—three for every two users. Most were basic how-to questions; a few involved major technical glitches. Printing problems abounded. Many patient medications and instructions hadn’t transferred accurately from our old system. My hospital had to hire hundreds of moonlighting residents and pharmacists to double-check the medication list for every patient while technicians worked to fix the data-transfer problem. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Surfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made Wave Many of the angriest complaints, however, were due to problems rooted in what Sumit Rana, a senior vice-president at Epic, called “the Revenge of the Ancillaries.” In building a given function—say, an order form for a brain MRI—the design choices were more political than technical: administrative staff and doctors had different views about what should be included. The doctors were used to having all the votes. But Epic had arranged meetings to try to adjudicate these differences. Now the staff had a say (and sometimes the doctors didn’t even show), and they added questions that made their jobs easier but other jobs more time-consuming. Questions that doctors had routinely skipped now stopped them short, with “field required” alerts. A simple request might now involve filling out a detailed form that took away precious minutes of time with patients. Rana said that these growing pains were predictable. The Epic people always build in a period for “optimization”—reconfiguring various functions according to feedback from users. “The first week,” he told me, “people say, ‘How am I going to get through this?’ At a year, they say, ‘I wish you could do this and that.’ ” I saw what he meant. After six months, I’d become fairly proficient with the new software. I’d bring my laptop with me to each appointment, open but at my side. “How can I help?” I’d ask a patient. My laptop was available for checking information and tapping in occasional notes; after the consultation, I completed my office report. Some things were slower than they were with our old system, and some things had improved. From my computer, I could now remotely check the vital signs of my patients recovering from surgery in the hospital. With two clicks, I could look up patient results from outside institutions that use Epic, as many now do. For the most part, my clinical routine did not change very much. As a surgeon, though, I spend most of my clinical time in the operating room. I wondered how my more office-bound colleagues were faring. I sought out Susan Sadoughi, whom an internist friend described to me as one of the busiest and most efficient doctors in his group. Sadoughi is a fifty-year-old primary-care physician, originally from Iran, who has worked at our hospital for twenty-four years. She’s married to a retired Boston police lieutenant and has three kids. Making time in her work and family schedule to talk to me was revealingly difficult. The only window we found was in the early morning, when we talked by phone during her commute. Sadoughi told me that she has four patient slots per hour. If she’s seeing a new patient, or doing an annual physical, she’ll use two slots. Early on, she recognized that technology could contribute to streamlining care. She joined a committee overseeing updates of a home-built electronic-medical-record system we used to rely on, helping to customize it for the needs of her fellow primary-care physicians. When she got word of the new system, she was optimistic. Not any longer. She feels that it has made things worse for her and her patients. Before, Sadoughi almost never had to bring tasks home to finish. Now she routinely spends an hour or more on the computer after her children have gone to bed. She gave me an example. Each patient has a “problem list” with his or her active medical issues, such as difficult-to-control diabetes, early signs of dementia, a chronic heart-valve problem. The list is intended to tell clinicians at a glance what they have to consider when seeing a patient. Sadoughi used to keep the list carefully updated—deleting problems that were no longer relevant, adding details about ones that were. But now everyone across the organization can modify the list, and, she said, “it has become utterly useless.” Three people will list the same diagnosis three different ways. Or an orthopedist will list the same generic symptom for every patient (“pain in leg”), which is sufficient for billing purposes but not useful to colleagues who need to know the specific diagnosis (e.g., “osteoarthritis in the right knee”). Or someone will add “anemia” to the problem list but not have the expertise to record the relevant details; Sadoughi needs to know that it’s “anemia due to iron deficiency, last colonoscopy 2017.” The problem lists have become a hoarder’s stash. “They’re long, they’re deficient, they’re redundant,” she said. “Now I come to look at a patient, I pull up the problem list, and it means nothing. I have to go read through their past notes, especially if I’m doing urgent care,” where she’s usually meeting someone for the first time. And piecing together what’s important about the patient’s history is at times actually harder than when she had to leaf through a sheaf of paper records. Doctors’ handwritten notes were brief and to the point. With computers, however, the shortcut is to paste in whole blocks of information—an entire two-page imaging report, say—rather than selecting the relevant details. The next doctor must hunt through several pages to find what really matters. Multiply that by twenty-some patients a day, and you can see Sadoughi’s problem. The software “has created this massive monster of incomprehensibility,” she said, her voice rising. Before she even sets eyes upon a patient, she is already squeezed for time. And at each step along the way the complexity mounts. “Ordering a mammogram used to be one click,” she said. “Now I spend three extra clicks to put in a diagnosis. When I do a Pap smear, I have eleven clicks. It’s ‘Oh, who did it?’ Why not, by default, think that I did it?” She was almost shouting now. “I’m the one putting the order in. Why is it asking me what date, if the patient is in the office today? When do you think this actually happened? It is incredible!” The Revenge of the Ancillaries, I thought. She continued rattling off examples like these. “Most days, I will have done only around thirty to sixty per cent of my notes by the end of the day,” she said. The rest came after hours. Spending the extra time didn’t anger her. The pointlessness of it did. Difficulties with computers in the workplace are not unique to medicine. Matt Spencer is a British anthropologist who studies scientists instead of civilizations. After spending eighteen months embedded with a group of researchers studying fluid dynamics at Imperial College London, he made a set of observations about the painful evolution of humans’ relationship with software in a 2015 paper entitled “Brittleness and Bureaucracy.” Years before, a graduate student had written a program, called Fluidity, that allowed the research group to run computer simulations of small-scale fluid dynamics—specifically, ones related to the challenge of safely transporting radioactive materials for nuclear reactors. The program was elegant and powerful, and other researchers were soon applying it to a wide range of other problems. They regularly added new features to it, and, over time, the program expanded to more than a million lines of code, in multiple computer languages. Every small change produced unforeseen bugs. As the software grew more complex, the code became more brittle—more apt to malfunction or to crash. The I.B.M. software engineer Frederick Brooks, in his classic 1975 book, “The Mythical Man-Month,” called this final state the Tar Pit. There is, he said, a predictable progression from a cool program (built, say, by a few nerds for a few of their nerd friends) to a bigger, less cool program product (to deliver the same function to more people, with different computer systems and different levels of ability) to an even bigger, very uncool program system (for even more people, with many different needs in many kinds of work). Spencer plotted the human reaction that accompanied this progression. People initially embraced new programs and new capabilities with joy, then came to depend on them, then found themselves subject to a system that controlled their lives. At that point, they could either submit or rebel. The scientists in London rebelled. “They were sick of results that they had gotten one week no longer being reproducible a week later,” Spencer wrote. They insisted that the group spend a year rewriting the code from scratch. And yet, after the rewrite, the bureaucratic shackles remained. As a program adapts and serves more people and more functions, it naturally requires tighter regulation. Software systems govern how we interact as groups, and that makes them unavoidably bureaucratic in nature. There will always be those who want to maintain the system and those who want to push the system’s boundaries. Conservatives and liberals emerge. Scientists now talked of “old Fluidity,” the smaller program with fewer collaborators which left scientists free to develop their own idiosyncratic styles of research, and “new Fluidity,” which had many more users and was, accordingly, more rule-bound. Changes required committees, negotiations, unsatisfactory split-the-difference solutions. Many scientists complained to Spencer in the way that doctors do—they were spending so much time on the requirements of the software that they were losing time for actual research. “I just want to do science!” one scientist lamented. Yet none could point to a better way. “While interviewees would make their resistance known to me,” Spencer wrote, “none of them went so far as to claim that Fluidity could be better run in a different manner.” New Fluidity had capabilities that no small, personalized system could ever provide and that the scientists couldn’t replace. The Tar Pit has trapped a great many of us: clinicians, scientists, police, salespeople—all of us hunched over our screens, spending more time dealing with constraints on how we do our jobs and less time simply doing them. And the only choice we seem to have is to adapt to this reality or become crushed by it. Many have been crushed. The Berkeley psychologist Christina Maslach has spent years studying the phenomenon of occupational burnout. She focussed on health care early on, drawn by the demanding nature of working with the sick. She defined burnout as a combination of three distinct feelings: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (a cynical, instrumental attitude toward others), and a sense of personal ineffectiveness. The opposite, a feeling of deep engagement in one’s work, came from a sense of energy, personal involvement, and efficacy. She and her colleagues developed a twenty-two-question survey known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which, for nearly four decades, has been used to track the well-being of workers across a vast range of occupations, from prison guards to teachers. In recent years, it has become apparent that doctors have developed extraordinarily high burnout rates. In 2014, fifty-four per cent of physicians reported at least one of the three symptoms of burnout, compared with forty-six per cent in 2011. Only a third agreed that their work schedule “leaves me enough time for my personal/family life,” compared with almost two-thirds of other workers. Female physicians had even higher burnout levels (along with lower satisfaction with their work-life balance). A Mayo Clinic analysis found that burnout increased the likelihood that physicians switched to part-time work. It was driving doctors out of practice. Burnout seemed to vary by specialty. Surgical professions such as neurosurgery had especially poor ratings of work-life balance and yet lower than average levels of burnout. Emergency physicians, on the other hand, had a better than average work-life balance but the highest burnout scores. The inconsistencies began to make sense when a team at the Mayo Clinic discovered that one of the strongest predictors of burnout was how much time an individual spent tied up doing computer documentation. Surgeons spend relatively little of their day in front of a computer. Emergency physicians spend a lot of it that way. As digitization spreads, nurses and other health-care professionals are feeling similar effects from being screen-bound. Sadoughi told me of her own struggles—including a daily battle with her Epic “In Basket,” which had become, she said, clogged to the point of dysfunction. There are messages from patients, messages containing lab and radiology results, messages from colleagues, messages from administrators, automated messages about not responding to previous messages. “All the letters that come from the subspecialists, I can’t read ninety per cent of them. So I glance at the patient’s name, and, if it’s someone that I was worried about, I’ll read that,” she said. The rest she deletes, unread. “If it’s just a routine follow-up with an endocrinologist, I hope to God that if there was something going on that they needed my attention on, they would send me an e-mail.” In short, she hopes they’ll try to reach her at yet another in-box. As I observed more of my colleagues, I began to see the insidious ways that the software changed how people work together. They’d become more disconnected; less likely to see and help one another, and often less able to. Jessica Jacobs, a longtime office assistant in my practice—mid-forties, dedicated, with a smoker’s raspy voice—said that each new software system reduced her role and shifted more of her responsibilities onto the doctors. Previously, she sorted the patient records before clinic, drafted letters to patients, prepped routine prescriptions—all tasks that lightened the doctors’ load. None of this was possible anymore. The doctors had to do it all themselves. She called it “a ‘stay in your lane’ thing.” She couldn’t even help the doctors navigate and streamline their computer systems: office assistants have different screens and are not trained or authorized to use the ones doctors have. “You can’t learn more from the system,” she said. “You can’t do more. You can’t take on extra responsibilities.” Even fixing minor matters is often not in her power. She’d recently noticed, for instance, that the system had the wrong mailing address for a referring doctor. But, she told me, “all I can do is go after the help desk thirteen times.” Jacobs felt sad and sometimes bitter about this pattern of change: “It’s disempowering. It’s sort of like they want any cookie-cutter person to be able to walk in the door, plop down in a seat, and just do the job exactly as it is laid out.” Sadoughi felt much the same: “The first year Epic came in, I was so close to saying, ‘That’s it. I’m done with primary care, I’m going to be an urgent-care doctor. I’m not going to open another In Basket.’ It took all this effort reëvaluating my purpose to stick with it.” Gregg Meyer sympathizes, but he isn’t sorry. As the chief clinical officer at Partners HealthCare, Meyer supervised the software upgrade. An internist in his fifties, he has the commanding air, upright posture, and crewcut one might expect from a man who spent half his career as a military officer. “I’m the veteran of four large-scale electronic-health-records implementations,” he told me in his office, overlooking downtown Boston. Those included two software overhauls in the military and one at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, where he’d become the chief clinical officer. He still sees patients, and he experiences the same frustrations I was hearing about. Sometimes more: he admits he’s not as tech-savvy as his younger colleagues. “But we think of this as a system for us and it’s not,” he said. “It is for the patients.” While some sixty thousand staff members use the system, almost ten times as many patients log into it to look up their lab results, remind themselves of the medications they are supposed to take, read the office notes that their doctor wrote in order to better understand what they’ve been told. Today, patients are the fastest-growing user group for electronic medical records. Computerization also allows clinicians to help patients in ways that hadn’t been possible before. In one project, Partners is scanning records to identify people who have been on opioids for more than three months, in order to provide outreach and reduce the risk of overdose. Another effort has begun to identify patients who have been diagnosed with high-risk diseases like cancer but haven’t received prompt treatment. The ability to adjust protocols electronically has let Meyer’s team roll out changes far faster as new clinical evidence comes in. And the ability to pull up records from all hospitals that use the same software is driving real improvements in care. Meyer gave me an example. “The care of the homeless population of Boston took a quantum leap,” he said. With just a few clicks, “we can see the fact that they had three TB rule-outs”—three negative test results for tuberculosis—“someplace else in town, which means, O.K., I don’t have to put him in an isolation room.” In Meyer’s view, we’re only just beginning to experience what patient benefits are possible. A recent study bolsters his case. Researchers looked at Medicare patients admitted to hospitals for fifteen common conditions, and analyzed how their thirty-day death rates changed as their hospitals computerized. The results shifted over time. In the first year of the study, deaths actually increased 0.11 per cent for every new function added—an apparent cost of the digital learning curve. But after that deaths dropped 0.21 per cent a year for every function added. If computerization causes doctors some annoyance but improves patient convenience and saves lives, Meyer is arguing, isn’t it time we all got on board? “I’m playing the long game,” he said. “I have full faith that all that stuff is just going to get better with time.” And yet it’s perfectly possible to envisage a system that makes care ever better for those who receive it and ever more miserable for those who provide it. Hasn’t this been the story in many fields? The complaints of today’s health-care professionals may just be a white-collar, high-tech equivalent of the century-old blue-collar discontent with “Taylorization”—the industrial philosophy of fragmenting work into components, standardizing operations, and strictly separating those who design the workflow from those who do the work. As Frederick Winslow Taylor, the Progressive Era creator of “scientific management,” put it, “In the past, the man has been first; in the future, the system must be first.” Well, we are in that future, and the system is the computer. Indeed, the computer, by virtue of its brittle nature, seems to require that it come first. Brittleness is the inability of a system to cope with surprises, and, as we apply computers to situations that are ever more interconnected and layered, our systems are confounded by ever more surprises. By contrast, the systems theorist David Woods notes, human beings are designed to handle surprises. We’re resilient; we evolved to handle the shifting variety of a world where events routinely fall outside the boundaries of expectation. As a result, it’s the people inside organizations, not the machines, who must improvise in the face of unanticipated events. Last fall, the night before daylight-saving time ended, an all-user e-mail alert went out. The system did not have a way to record information when the hour from 1 a.m. to 1:59 a.m. repeated in the night. This was, for the system, a surprise event. The only solution was to shut down the lab systems during the repeated hour. Data from integrated biomedical devices (such as monitoring equipment for patients’ vital signs) would be unavailable and would have to be recorded by hand. Fetal monitors in the obstetrics unit would have to be manually switched off and on at the top of the repeated hour. Medicine is a complex adaptive system: it is made up of many interconnected, multilayered parts, and it is meant to evolve with time and changing conditions. Software is not. It is complex, but it does not adapt. That is the heart of the problem for its users, us humans. Adaptation requires two things: mutation and selection. Mutation produces variety and deviation; selection kills off the least functional mutations. Our old, craft-based, pre-computer system of professional practice—in medicine and in other fields—was all mutation and no selection. There was plenty of room for individuals to do things differently from the norm; everyone could be an innovator. But there was no real mechanism for weeding out bad ideas or practices. Computerization, by contrast, is all selection and no mutation. Leaders install a monolith, and the smallest changes require a committee decision, plus weeks of testing and debugging to make sure that fixing the daylight-saving-time problem, say, doesn’t wreck some other, distant part of the system. For those in charge, this kind of system oversight is welcome. Gregg Meyer is understandably delighted to have the electronic levers to influence the tens of thousands of clinicians under his purview. He had spent much of his career seeing his hospitals blighted by unsafe practices that, in the paper-based world, he could do little about. A cardiologist might decide to classify and treat patients with congestive heart failure differently from the way his colleagues did, and with worse results. That used to happen all the time. “Now there’s a change-control process,” Meyer said. “When everything touches everything, you have to have change-control processes.” But those processes cannot handle more than a few change projects at a time. Artisanship has been throttled, and so has our professional capacity to identify and solve problems through ground-level experimentation. Why can’t our work systems be like our smartphones—flexible, easy, customizable? The answer is that the two systems have different purposes. Consumer technology is all about letting me be me. Technology for complex enterprises is about helping groups do what the members cannot easily do by themselves—work in coördination. Our individual activities have to mesh with everyone else’s. What we want and don’t have, however, is a system that accommodates both mutation and selection. Human beings do not only rebel. We also create. We force at least a certain amount of mutation, even when systems resist. Consider that, in recent years, one of the fastest-growing occupations in health care has been medical-scribe work, a field that hardly existed before electronic medical records. Medical scribes are trained assistants who work alongside physicians to take computer-related tasks off their hands. This fix is, admittedly, a little ridiculous. We replaced paper with computers because paper was inefficient. Now computers have become inefficient, so we’re hiring more humans. And it sort of works. Not long ago, I spent a day following Lynden Lee as he scribed at a Massachusetts General Hospital primary-care practice. Lee, a twenty-three-year-old graduate of Boston University, is an Asian-American raised in Illinois, and, like many scribes, he was doing the job, earning minimum wage, while he applied to medical school. He worked for Allan Goroll, a seventy-two-year-old internist of the old school—fuzzy eyebrows, steel-wool hair, waist-length white coat. Lee, wearing the scribe uniform of neatly tucked oxford shirt and khakis, went to get the morning’s first patient from the waiting room. He’d developed a short speech to introduce himself: “I help take notes, so that Dr. Goroll can spend more time with you instead of typing at the computer. But, of course, if there’s anything you need to say, or would like to discuss with Dr. Goroll, in private, I can certainly leave the room.” The first patient was Zoya Shteynberg, a fifty-seven-year-old immigrant from the Soviet Union with copper-red hair and red-rimmed glasses. She is the wife of a dentist, who is also a patient of Goroll’s. “I take care of his whole family—his mother, his wife, their daughters,” he said. “Zoya runs the office.” Goroll faced Shteynberg across his desk. To his left, his computer sat untouched. To his right, Lee stood behind a wheeled laptop stand, his fingers already tapping at the keys. He’d pulled up information for Goroll to review as he came in—the notes from Shteynberg’s last visit with him, and recent visits to other specialists—and was starting to write a new medical note. The story Shteynberg told was complex, and unfolded, as medical stories often do, in pieces that were difficult to connect. She had been having sudden, unusual episodes. They sometimes made her short of breath, at other times nauseated. While driving her car, she had an attack in which her heart raced and she felt so light-headed that she feared she might pass out. She had a history of high blood pressure, and she had frequent ear congestion. Goroll probed and listened, while Lee recorded the details. Every once in a while, the doctor asked Lee to look up information—the trend of her last blood-pressure measurements, or the results of various tests she’d had. He paused to tell Lee how to organize the information: to list faintness, high blood pressure, and ear congestion as three separate problems, not one. When it came time for a physical examination, Lee and I stood behind a curtain, giving Shteynberg privacy. Goroll called out his findings for Lee to record. (“Skin: warm and dry, no pallor.”) While Shteynberg dressed, he stood with Lee outside the room and instructed him about tests he wanted done. Lee couldn’t sign any orders, but he could enter them in the computer for Goroll to review and authorize later. We returned to the room, and the doctor summarized his observations for Shteynberg. He wasn’t alarmed, but he had no explanation yet for her episodes. He listed a few possibilities and follow-up tests. Then he told her, “Am I worried about these things? No.” She was relieved. “Me, either,” she said. Scribes aren’t a perfect solution. Underpaid and minimally trained, they learn mostly on the go, and turn over rapidly (most within months). Research has found error rates between twenty-four and fifty per cent in recording key data; Goroll still spends time after clinic reviewing the charts and correcting errors. But Lee spared him many hours a week, and Goroll was thrilled about it. He got back enough time to start work on the eighth edition of a textbook he has written on primary-care medicine. And, because of his scribe, he was able to give his patient his complete attention throughout the consultation. In recent years, he’d found this increasingly difficult. Shteynberg said she was all in favor of scribes: “Because now Dr. Goroll will come right up in front of my eyes, and he listens.” She explained that he used to look at his screen, instead of at her, and type while he spoke. “That bothered you?” he asked, surprised. “Oh, yes,” she said. We are already seeing the next mutation. During the past year, Massachusetts General Hospital has been trying out a “virtual scribe” service, in which India-based doctors do the documentation based on digitally recorded patient visits. Compared with “live scribing,” this system is purportedly more accurate—since the scribes tend to be fully credentialled doctors, not aspiring med students—for the same price or cheaper. IKS Health, which provides the service, currently has four hundred physicians on staff in Mumbai giving support to thousands of patient visits a day in clinics across the United States. The company expects to employ more than a thousand doctors in the coming year, and it has competitors taking the same approach. Siddhesh Rane is one of its doctor-scribes. A thirty-two-year-old orthopedic surgeon from a town called Kolhapur, he seemed like any of my surgical colleagues here in Boston, direct, driven, with his photo I.D. swaying on a lanyard around his neck. He’d joined the company for the learning opportunity, he said, not the pay (although many of the IKS staffers were better paid than they would be in a local medical practice). He explained the virtual-scribe system to me when we spoke via Skype. With the patient’s permission, physicians record an entire patient visit with a multidirectional microphone, then encrypt and transmit the recording online. In India, Rane listens to the visit and writes a first draft of the office note. Before starting the work, he went through a careful “onboarding” process with each of the American physicians he works with. One, Nathalee Kong, a thirty-one-year-old internist, was based at an M.G.H. clinic in Revere, a working-class community north of Boston. For a week, Rane listened to recordings of her patient visits and observed how she wrote them up. For another week, they wrote parallel notes, to make sure Rane was following Kong’s preferences. They agreed on trigger phrases; when she says to the patient, “Your exam is normal except for . . . ,” Rane can record the usual elements of her head-to-toe exam without her having to call each one out. A note for a thirty-minute visit takes Rane about an hour to process. It is then reviewed by a second physician for quality and accuracy, and by an insurance-coding expert, who confirms that it complies with regulations—and who, not incidentally, provides guidance on taking full advantage of billing opportunities. IKS Health says that its virtual-scribe service pays for itself by increasing physician productivity—in both the number of patients that physicians see and the amount billed per patient. Kong was delighted by the arrangement. “Now all I have to do is listen to the patient and be present,” she told me. When taking a family history, she said, “I don’t have to go back and forth: ‘O.K., so your mom had breast cancer. Let me check that off in the computer before I forget.’ I’m just having a natural conversation with another human being, instead of feeling like I’m checking off a box, which I literally was doing.” Before working with Rane, Kong rarely left the office before 7 p.m., and even then she had to do additional work at home in order to complete her notes. Now she can leave at five o’clock. “I’m hopeful that this prevents me from burning out,” she said. “That’s something I was definitely aware of going into this profession—something that I really feared.” What’s more, she now has the time and the energy to explore the benefits of a software system that might otherwise seem to be simply a burden. Kong manages a large number of addiction patients, and has learned how to use a list to track how they are doing as a group, something she could never have done on her own. She has also learned to use a function that enters a vaccine table into patients’ notes, allowing her to list the vaccinations they should have received and the ones they are missing. Her biggest concern now? That the scribes will be taken away. Yet can it really be sustainable to have an additional personal assistant—a fully trained doctor in India, no less—for every doctor with a computer? And, meanwhile, what’s happening across the globe? Who is taking care of the patients all those scribing doctors aren’t seeing? There’s a techno-optimist view of how this story will unfold. Big technology companies are already circling to invest in IKS Health. They see an opportunity for artificial intelligence to replace more and more of what Rane does. This prospect doesn’t worry Rane very much; by the time technology has taken his place, he hopes to have set up a clinic of his own, and perhaps get to use the system himself. It’s not hard to believe that our interfaces for documenting and communicating will get easier, more intuitive, less annoying. But there’s also a techno-pessimist version of the story. A 2015 study of scribes for emergency physicians in an Atlanta hospital system found that the scribes produced results similar to what my Boston colleagues described—a thirty-six-per-cent reduction in the doctors’ computer-documentation time and a similar increase in time spent directly interacting with patients. Two-thirds of the doctors said that they “liked” or even “loved” having a scribe. Yet they also reported no significant change in their job satisfaction. With the time that scribes freed up, the system simply got doctors to take on more patients. Their workload didn’t lighten; it just shifted. Studies of scribes in other health systems have found the same effect. Squeezing more patients into an hour is better than spending time entering data at a keyboard. More people are taken care of. But are they being taken care of well? As patients, we want the caring and the ingenuity of clinicians to be augmented by systems, not defeated by them. In an era of professional Taylorization—of the stay-in-your-lane ethos—that does not seem to be what we are getting. Putting the system first is not inevitable. Postwar Japan and West Germany eschewed Taylor’s method of industrial management, and implemented more collaborative approaches than was typical in the U.S. In their factories, front-line workers were expected to get involved when production problems arose, instead of being elbowed aside by top-down management. By the late twentieth century, American manufacturers were scrambling to match the higher quality and lower costs that these methods delivered. If our machines are pushing medicine in the wrong direction, it’s our fault, not the machines’ fault. Some people are pushing back. Neil R. Malhotra is a boyish, energetic, forty-three-year-old neurosurgeon who has made his mark at the University of Pennsylvania as something of a tinkerer. He has a knack for tackling difficult medical problems. In the past year alone, he has published papers on rebuilding spinal disks using tissue engineering, on a better way to teach residents how to repair cerebral aneurysms, and on which spinal-surgery techniques have the lowest level of blood loss. When his hospital’s new electronic-medical-record system arrived, he immediately decided to see if he could hack the system. He wasn’t a programmer, however, and wasn’t interested in becoming one. So he sought out Judy Thornton, a software analyst from the hospital’s I.T. department. Together, they convened an open weekly meeting, currently on Thursday mornings, where everyone in the neurosurgery department—from the desk clerks to the medical staff to the bosses—could come not just to complain about the system but also to reimagine it. Department members feared that Malhotra’s pet project would be a time sink. Epic heard about his plans to fiddle around with its system and reacted with alarm. The hospital lawyers resisted, too. “They didn’t want us to build something that potentially had a lot of intellectual property in someone else’s system,” Malhotra said. But he managed to keep the skeptics from saying no outright. Soon, he and his fellow-tinkerers were removing useless functions and adding useful ones. Before long, they had built a faster, more intuitive interface, designed specifically for neurosurgery office visits. It would capture much more information that really mattered in the care of patients with brain tumors, cerebral aneurysms, or spinal problems. Now there was mutation and selection—through a combination of individual ingenuity and group preference. One new feature the department embraced, for instance, enlists the help of patients. At the end of a visit, doctors give the keyboard to patients, who provide their firsthand ratings of various factors that show how they’re progressing: their ability to walk without assistance, or their level of depression and anxiety. The data on mobility before surgery turned out to predict which patients would need to be prepared for time in a rehabilitation center and which ones could go straight home from the hospital. Malhotra’s innovations showed that there were ways for users to take at least some control of their technology—to become, with surprising ease, creators. Granted, letting everyone tinker inside our medical-software systems would risk crashing them. But a movement has emerged to establish something like an app store for electronic medical records, one that functions much the way the app store on your smartphone does. If the software companies provided an “application programming interface,” or A.P.I., staff could pick and choose apps according to their needs: an internist could download an app to batch patients’ prescription refills; a pediatric nurse could download one to set up a growth chart. Electronic-medical-record companies have fought against opening up their systems this way because of the loss of control (and potential revenue) doing so would entail. In the past couple of years, though, many have begun to bend. Even Epic has launched its “App Orchard.” It’s still in the early stages—only about a hundred apps are available, and there are strict limits on what kinds of customization it enables—but it’s a step in the right direction. “You know what I’m excited about?” Malhotra said to me. “Walking.” He had collected data on the walking ability of ten thousand patients—both before and after surgery. “In any set of patients, what is our goal? It’s to maintain mobility or, in many cases, improve it.” Previously, his department could track only rates of survival and complications. Now he’s experimenting with an app that could live on patients’ phones and provide more granular data about their recovery process. “You’d turn on the neurosurgery module when you are seeing us, which would wake up at those time points to give you a notification saying, ‘Hey, can you do these surveys? They help your care, and you can do them on your phone.’ ” I told him about a similar app my research team was experimenting with, which collects step counts, among other measures, after surgery. But we had no way to adjust our electronic medical records so that clinicians could readily find a particular patient’s results. “Step counts!” Malhotra said. “Oh, if we just had step counts.” His wheels were turning. What if they made a tab in the electronic medical record with whatever data on activity patients were willing to provide? “You could do that?” I said. “Sure. Why not?” It’s a beguiling vision. Many fear that the advance of technology will replace us all with robots. Yet in fields like health care the more imminent prospect is that it will make us all behave like robots. And the people we serve need something more than either robots or robot-like people can provide. They need human enterprises that can adapt to change. It was a Monday afternoon. I was in clinic. I had no scribe, in India or otherwise; no cool app to speed me through my note-writing or serve up all my patient’s information in some nifty, instantly absorbable visual. It was just me, my computer, a file of papers, and John Cameron, a lanky, forty-three-year-old construction supervisor who’d been healthy all his life, felt fine, but was told to see a surgeon for reasons that he still didn’t completely understand. It all started, he told me, with a visit to his primary-care provider for a routine physical. I held a printout of the doctor’s note. (My high-tech hack is to have key materials printed out, because it takes too long to flip between screens.) It said that she’d found a calcium level so high it was a wonder that Cameron wasn’t delirious. The internist sent him to an endocrinologist, who found, deep in his electronic records, a forgotten history of several benign skin lesions. The specialist wondered if Cameron had a rare genetic syndrome that’s known to cause tumors and, in turn, hormone abnormalities, skin lesions, and high calcium levels. The diagnosis seemed very unlikely, but a battery of tests had turned up surprising results, including abnormal levels of a pituitary hormone. I needed to log into the computer to check the original lab reports. He watched me silently click one tab after another. Minutes passed. I became aware of how long it was taking me to pull up the right results. Finally, I let go of the mouse and took Cameron to the examining table. When I’d finished the exam and we sat down again at my little computer desk against the wall, I told him what I’d determined. He had a parathyroid tumor, it had pushed his calcium levels dangerously high, and it needed to be removed surgically. I took out a pen and paper, and drew a picture to explain how the surgery would be done. First, though, we needed to get his calcium under control. The abnormal levels of the pituitary hormone suggested that he might have a tumor in his pituitary gland as well—and might even have the unusual genetic syndrome. I was less sure about this, I told him, so I wanted to do more testing and get an opinion from an expert at my hospital. Cameron’s situation was too complicated for a thirty-minute slot. We’d gone way over time. Other patients were waiting. Plus, I still had to type up all my findings, along with our treatment plan. “Any questions?” I asked, hoping he’d have none. “It’s a lot to take in,” he said. “I feel normal. It’s hard to imagine all this going on.” He looked at me, expecting me to explain more. I hesitated. Let’s talk after the new tests come back, I said. Later, I thought about how unsatisfactory my response was. I’d wanted to put my computer away—to sort out what he’d understood and what he hadn’t, to learn a bit about who he really was, to make a connection. But I had that note to type, and the next patient stewing across the hall. The story of modern medicine is the story of our human struggle with complexity. Technology will, without question, continually increase our ability to make diagnoses, to peer more deeply inside the body and the brain, to offer more treatments. It will help us document it all—but not necessarily to make sense of it all. Technology inevitably produces more noise and new uncertainties. Perhaps a computer could have alerted me to the possibility of a genetic disorder in John Cameron, based on his history of skin lesions and the finding of high calcium. But our systems are forever generating alerts about possible connections—to the point of signal fatigue. Just ordering medications and lab tests triggers dozens of alerts each day, most of them irrelevant, and all in need of human reviewing and sorting. There are more surprises, not fewer. The volume of knowledge and capability increases faster than any individual can manage—and faster than our technologies can make manageable for us. We ultimately need systems that make the right care simpler for both patients and professionals, not more complicated. And they must do so in ways that strengthen our human connections, instead of weakening them. Aweek or two after my visit with Cameron, I called him to review his laboratory results. A scan had pinpointed a parathyroid tumor in the right side of his neck, which would be straightforward to remove. A test showed that he didn’t have the genetic syndrome, after all, and a brain scan showed no pituitary tumor. I had more time for his questions now, and I let him ask them. When we were done and I was about to get off the phone, I paused. I asked him if he’d noticed, during our office visit, how much time I’d spent on the computer. “Yes, absolutely,” he said. He added, “I’ve been in your situation. I knew you were just trying to find the information you needed. I was actually trying not to talk too much, because I knew you were in a hurry, but I needed you to look the information up. I wanted you to be able to do that. I didn’t want to push you too far.” It was painful to hear. Forced to choose between having the right technical answer and a more human interaction, Cameron picked having the right technical answer. I asked him what he meant about having been in my situation. As a construction-site supervisor, he said, he spends half his day in front of his laptop and half in front of people. His current job was overseeing the construction of a thirty-eight-unit apartment complex in town. “I have to make sure that things are being done per design and the specifications,” he said. That involves looking up lots of information, logging inspection data, and the like. But, at the same time, he has to communicate with lots of people. “I have to be out in the field checking and dealing with subcontractors and employees of our own.” The technology at his disposal has grown more powerful in recent years. “We have cloud-based quality-control software, where we document the job at different stages. I can use that information for punch lists and quality-control checks. We also have a time-lapse camera where we can go back and look at things that we might’ve missed.” The technology is more precise, but it’s made everything more complicated and time-consuming. He faces the same struggle that I do. Cameron was philosophical about it. He’s worked with big construction companies and small ones and used numerous software systems along the way. He couldn’t do without them. And yet, he said, “all these different technologies and apps on these iPads, all the stuff that I’ve had to use over the years, they’re supposed to make our job easier. But they’re either slow, or they’re cumbersome, or they require a lot of data entry and they’re not efficient.” The system inundates his subcontractors with e-mail alerts, for instance. “ ‘You gotta submit this, you’re behind on that, you didn’t finish the punch list.’ The project managers and superintendents and subcontractors eventually say, ‘Enough’s enough. We can’t deal with all these e-mails. It’s ridiculous.’ So they ignore them all. Then nothing gets done. You end up on the phone, back to the old-school way. Because it’s a people business.” He went on, “I don’t allow anybody to work on my job unless they go through a one-hour orientation with me. I have to know these guys personally. They have to know me. Millions of years human beings evolved to look at each other in the face, to use facial expression to create connection.” I’d talked to dozens of experts, but Cameron might have been the wisest of them all. There was something comforting about the way he accepted the inevitability of conflict between our network connections and our human connections. We can retune and streamline our systems, but we won’t find a magical sweet spot between competing imperatives. We can only insure that people always have the ability to turn away from their screens and see each other, colleague to colleague, clinician to patient, face to face. The next time I saw Cameron was on the day of his operation. He lay on a stretcher outside the operating room, waiting to be wheeled in. A computer screen on a boom loomed over the bed, showing the safety checks I still had to do. I shook Cameron’s hand and was introduced to his wife, who was in a chair beside him. They smiled nervously. It was his first time going under anesthesia. I told them about who would be on the surgical team with me and what was going to happen. I reached for the computer. But then I hesitated. I remembered when I’d turned my back on Cameron at our last encounter. “Let’s go through these checks together,” I said. I angled the screen toward the couple. Side by side, we confirmed that his medical history was up to date, that the correct surgical site was marked on his body, that I’d reviewed his medication allergies. His shoulders began to relax. His wife’s did, too. “Are you ready?” I asked. “I am,” he said. ♦ An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated that the author built a one-kilobyte computer in 1978.

"A Parlor Game at Rebekah
Mercer’s Has No Get Out of Jail Free Card",6029,"Robert Mercer, the New York hedge-fund magnate whose huge donations to pro-Trump groups in 2016 have been credited with putting Donald Trump in the White House, has kept a low profile since the election. But his daughter Rebekah, who runs the family’s foundation, now has a way to relive the thrill of the campaign with friends around her dinner table. In March, on a ski vacation at a rented house near Vail, Colorado, she brought a batch of copies of the “Rules of Play” for an elaborate parlor game called the Machine Learning President. Essentially, it is a race to the Oval Office in three fifteen-minute rounds. It’s a role-playing game, more like Assassin than like Monopoly, although players of this game do start out with an allotment of “cash” to spend on pushing their agendas, which can include “algorithmic policing” and “mass deportation.” “Tonight, the name of the game is power,” reads the first page of the “Rules of Play.” Each player, it goes on, “will assume a new political identity.” Instead of becoming Colonel Mustard or Mrs. Peacock, as in the board game Clue, each player takes on the role of a political candidate or a “faction,” in the game’s parlance. Among the possible roles are Mike Pence, Elizabeth Warren, Black Lives Matter, Russia, Y Combinator, Tom Steyer, Wall Street, Evangelicals, the Koch Network, and Robert Mercer himself. (Through a lawyer, Rebekah Mercer acknowledged possessing the game’s “Rules of Play” but denied any role in the creation of the game or that the game reflects her family’s views.) Rebekah Mercer, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, worked for her father’s hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, before quitting to homeschool her children. Unlike her reclusive father, who once told a colleague that he prefers the company of cats to that of people, Rebekah likes to socialize. She is said to have brought Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon into the Trump campaign, and she is a guiding force at the annual costume ball hosted by her family at its Long Island estate. (For the 2016 party, which President-elect Trump attended, the theme was “Villains and Heroes.”) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Inside the Minds of the New Crossword Constructors The goal of each player in the Machine Learning President is to win the Presidential election, over three rounds of play, designated as Super Tuesday, the Primary, and the General Election. Each candidate or faction starts with a “Briefing Dossier,” which “outlines your starting Cash, Influence, and Tech capabilities.” “During each round,” the Rules continue, “Candidates and Factions should be building alliances to increase their political Power and Voter turnout.” This can be accomplished through “political bargaining,” by “buying ads,” or by “investing in tech.” Just as the Monopoly player might get ahead by drawing a good Community Chest card, players of Mercer’s game try to utilize “machine learning”—that is, artificial intelligence driven by algorithms—to enhance their odds of winning. The “Rules of Play” don’t mention Cambridge Analytica, the now bankrupt data-mining firm that used vast amounts of online information obtained from Facebook without users’ consent to pinpoint and persuade voters, and in which the Mercer family invested millions of dollars—but the Machine Learning President echoes the firm’s tactics. In the section of game instructions that lists the possible identities that players can assume, Tom Steyer, the liberal hedge-fund billionaire who is financing a campaign to impeach Trump, is described as seeking “Minimum Wage Increase,” “Universal Basic Income,” and “Full path to citizenship (for undocumented immigrants).” The Rules include a description of Mercer’s father’s “character.” “Robert Mercer,” the instructions say, “sits atop one of the most powerful geo-political networks on the planet,” which is “driven by a next-generation technology stack with a business model.” They go on to note that “the Mercer Family is both a rival and an ally of the Kochs,” and claim that although the Mercers lack the “scale of business” of the Kochs, whose private company is the second largest in America, they compensate for it “with a constellation of over a dozen data analytics, machine learning, and electioneering companies around the world.” They continue, “The Mercers are building a global far-right movement to embed Judeo-Christian values” while “keeping government small, ineffective and out of the way.” The player who assumes the persona of Robert Mercer starts the game with six hundred million dollars in “cash” to implement his “policy wishlist,” which includes “Mass Deportation of Undocumented Immigrants,” the creation of a “biometrics/Citizens ID,” the use of “Predictive/Algorithmic Policing,” and “Freedom of Religious Discrimination (healthcare, hiring).” In other words, the stakes are higher than buying Boardwalk or sinking your opponent’s battleship.

"As Kennedy Retires, the Supreme Court’s Attack on Labor Unions Is a Sign of Things to Come",7388,"This week, the Supreme Court doled out victories to three powerful constituents of the Republican coalition. It upheld Donald Trump’s travel ban, sided with anti-abortion campaigners in California, and, on Wednesday, struck down an Illinois law that required public-sector workers to pay fees to unions that cover the cost of organizing collective bargaining, even if they don’t want to join the union proper. This last ruling—which came just hours before Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on the Court, announced his retirement—delivered a potentially crippling blow to the labor movement and the Democratic Party, with which it is aligned. All three decisions are likely harbingers of what is to come from an even more conservative Supreme Court bench. The labor-union ruling was particularly noteworthy because it broke with decades of precedent. During the past fifty years, union membership has declined precipitously in the private sector. Only about one in twelve privately employed workers are union members. In the public sector, about a third of the labor force is still unionized. The unions that represent teachers, police officers, government workers, and other public-sector professions are key players in Democratic politics, as well as vital defenders of wages and benefits for middle-class workers. But, in the absence of a legal mandate to pay dues, individual members of these unions will have a clear incentive to “free ride” on the efforts and payments of others. In such a situation, union membership can quickly unravel. Recognizing this logic, the Supreme Court ruled in 1977’s Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that unions could collect “agency fees” even from public-sector workers who didn’t want to join a union. These fees, which are a bit lower than typical union dues, are supposed to cover the costs of everything that the union does, except for its political activities. In the years after 1977, the basis of the Abood ruling was challenged a number of times, but without much success. As recently as ten years ago, the Court found that the Abood ruling was based on sound constitutional principles. The ruling on Wednesday didn’t come about by accident, however. It marks the culmination of a decades-long anti-union campaign by conservative groups and billionaires tied to the Republican Party, such as the Koch brothers, the Uihlein family, and their allies. By funnelling money through tax-exempt organizations like the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, the Liberty Justice Center, and the Center for Individual Rights, these ultra-wealthy people have helped to finance a series of legal attacks on labor unions that represent ordinary working people who earn modest wages. Faced with the formidable challenge of overturning what most experts regarded as settled law, the well-funded union haters persisted, and eventually they found a court that was willing to overturn precedent: the John Roberts–Neil Gorsuch high court. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold The case at the center of Wednesday’s ruling is Janus v. A.F.S.C.M.E. It was filed by Mark Janus, a child-support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services who objected to paying monthly union dues of roughly forty-five dollars. Janus’s lawyers claimed that the agency fees violated his constitutional rights. They argued that when public-sector labor unions bargain over things like salaries and pensions, they are engaging in a form of political speech that is designed to influence government policy, and that forcing Janus to help pay for this form of speech, even when he might have disagreed with the union’s stances, was a violation of the First Amendment. In March of last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh District rejected these arguments, citing the Abood judgment. But Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, not only accepted the First Amendment argument, he resoundingly endorsed it. Citing union efforts to resist government cuts, and the involvement of teachers’ unions on issues like merit pay, he argued that many of the stances that public-sector unions take are intrinsically political. “Fundamental free speech rights are at stake,” he wrote. “Abood was poorly reasoned. It has led to practical problems and abuse. It is inconsistent with other First Amendment cases and has been undermined by more recent decisions.” These decisions, which chipped away at Abood without overturning it, were made by Alito and his colleagues on the previous Roberts-Antonin Scalia court. After Scalia died, in 2016, the court deadlocked on union-dues cases. But when Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a member of the conservative Federalist Society, to replace Scalia, it was pretty clear that the Abood judgment was living on borrowed time. On Wednesday, the five conservative Justices delivered the death blow in a 5–4 decision. Writing for the minority, Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that the majority was proceeding regardless of law and precedent. “Over four decades, this Court has cited Abood favorably many times, and has affirmed and applied its central distinction between the costs of collective bargaining (which the government can charge to all employees) and those of political activities (which it cannot),” Kagan noted. In a thunderous conclusion, she said, “There is no sugarcoating today’s opinion. The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this Nation’s law—and in its economic life—for over 40 years. As a result, it prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance. And it does so by weaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.” For years, conservatives complained about activist liberal judges making it up as they went along. Today, they are the activists. Under the guise of “originalism,” they are rewriting the nation’s laws to further the reactionary political agenda of the Republican Party and its biggest donors. The process is a gradual one, and in some cases the Robert-Gorsuch court has held back, or temporized. But in the final week of this term it has shown its true colors. Once Trump finds another Gorsuch to replace Kennedy, whose retirement is effective July 31st, there may be no stopping the rightward lurch.

What Did A.T. &amp; T. Pay Michael Cohen For?,9296,"Last November, Randall Stephenson, the C.E.O. of A.T. & T., walked onto a stage in the Time Warner Center for an interview as part of the Times’ annual DealBook conference. The executive’s goal seemed straightforward: to convince everyone in attendance that his company’s historic merger with Time Warner was on track to close as planned. “We’re at advanced stages of negotiations and discussions with the Department of Justice,” he said. The two companies had announced their eighty-five-billion-dollar merger thirteen months earlier, but the deal was still undergoing a drawn-out review by the Justice Department for potential violations of antitrust laws. Audience members knew that President Trump was highly critical of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, and hated the way that the network had portrayed him. News reports surfaced the previous day suggesting that Trump was trying to pressure the Justice Department into requiring the company to sell CNN for the merger to be approved. “There are so many rumors and suppositions going around,” Stephenson said with a smile, leaning back in a white armchair. “First and foremost, irrespective of what was reported yesterday, I have never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN. Period. And, likewise, I have never offered to sell CNN. And let me repeat what we said yesterday: there is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.” Stephenson said that part of the delay was the grindingly slow process of getting the Senate to confirm Trump’s new Justice Department antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim. It had been a complex process for the companies, too, Stephenson explained, as they learned the Justice Department’s priorities and concerns. “You spend a lot of time getting to know what the bid ask is in a transaction,” Stephenson said. On Tuesday night, the potential contours of that bid and ask came into clearer focus. Michael Avenatti, the attorney representing the adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who is suing President Trump, released a document accusing Trump’s lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen of using a secret bank account to accept and pay out money to and from various parties. Avenatti claimed that Cohen had created a limited-liability company based in Delaware, called Essential Consultants, in October, 2016, shortly before the Presidential election, as well as a related account at First Republic Bank. The payments to and by Cohen, who is under investigation by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, included the disbursement of a hundred-and-thirty-thousand-dollar payment to Daniels in return for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. Other allegations contained in Avenatti’s report—many of which have been confirmed by other media outlets—raise major questions. The account allegedly received five hundred thousand dollars in payments from an investment firm linked to the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, as well as payments from several large corporations that have business interests under consideration by the Trump Administration, including a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical firm Novartis, which sent four payments, totalling close to four hundred thousand dollars, according to Avenetti’s records. (Novartis said it had hoped that Cohen “could advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain US healthcare policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act,” and had paid him $1.2 million.) The most shocking payment might be the one that concerns A.T. & T.: Between October, 2017, and January, 2018, according to Avenatti’s findings, the company paid a total of two hundred thousand dollars to Cohen’s L.L.C. The company confirmed the payments almost immediately. “Essential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,” A.T. & T. said. “They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? The statement rules out two of the most obvious and legitimate (if distasteful) potential explanations for such a transfer of funds—legal advice and lobbying. But that simply raises further questions: Why were the payments made by A.T. & T.? Who in the company knew about them? Who authorized them? And what was the company promised or expecting (even without an explicit promise) in return? It is possible that there is a logical—and legal—explanation for the payment. On the surface, though, the sequence of events is deeply disturbing. One of America’s most venerable and well-known corporations transferred large sums of money to the President’s personal attorney through secret, unofficial channels, at the same time that it was seeking government approval of its gigantic merger transaction. The suggestion that A.T. & T. believed that Trump’s personal lawyer was an appropriate person to approach for paid expertise about the new Administration is suspect. As Stephenson bantered on the conference stage, he hid the fact that his company had already paid a hundred thousand dollars to Michael Cohen. A.T. & T. has a great deal of explaining to do. It is common for companies large and small to spend prodigiously on lobbying in Washington, particularly when they have major regulatory issues under review. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, A.T. & T. spent $16.78 million on such lobbying in 2017, and has spent more than four million dollars so far in 2018, with the money going to a long list of law firms and strategy shops. The best thing that one can say about such expenditures is that they are typically publicly disclosed. The company never disclosed the payment to Cohen. The irony behind all this is that, if A.T. & T. had been hoping to improve the odds of seeing its merger completed, the strategy seems to have failed. On November 20th, just days after Stephenson’s optimistic performance at the Time Warner Center, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the merger from closing, on the basis that it would grant the companies too much market power and would ultimately hurt consumers. Economists generally agree that there has been too much corporate consolidation in the American media market, which has led to huge increases in the prices consumers pay for cable TV and Internet access, among other things, even as lively new providers of television series, such as Netflix and Amazon, have flourished. Still, A.T. & T. and Time Warner are in different businesses; the former provides phone, cable, and Internet access, while the latter produces content, through CNN, HBO, and other channels. The government has rarely opposed consolidation of companies in different businesses in the past, but some experts have been critical of the A.T. & T.–Time Warner merger nonetheless, because of how powerful the major media conglomerates already are. The companies and the Justice Department just completed a six-week trial in federal court in Washington, during which thousands of pages of documents were filed and the companies presented duelling economic experts as witnesses. Judge Richard Leon indicated that he would announce his decision by June 12th. Even if the deal is ultimately permitted to go through, it will have come after the expenditure of enormous resources. Still, the companies may have learned an important lesson in the process, one that has been internalized by many other past clients and business partners of the President: when entering into a bargain with Trump, one can never be sure that he will follow through on his end of the deal. Toward the end of Stephenson’s conference appearance last November, the CNN reporter Brian Stelter, who was in the audience, asked, “You haven’t spoken about President Trump, and the theories from Democratic lawmakers and public-interest groups that his hatred of CNN could be affecting what the D.O.J. is doing. Do you have any reason to believe that there’s a Trump factor?” Stephenson paused for a moment before answering. “I have no reason to believe that,” he said, throwing his hands in the air. A few moments later, he said, “It is what it is. What I try to do at any moment is try to be very candid.” A previous version of this post misstated the year in which Essential Consultants was created.

Ophelia Dahl’s National Health Service,53322,"Audio: Listen to this story. To hear more feature stories, download the Audm app for your iPhone. In many ways, life in Great Missenden was idyllic, bucolic, sweet. The author Roald Dahl and the movie star Patricia Neal called their cottage there, in the rolling English countryside of Buckinghamshire, Gipsy House, because they’d parked a bright-blue caravan in the garden for their four children to play in, and because there was a freewheeling spirit to the place. A dozen people might show up for dinner on any given night; Neal would frequently be on her way to the United States to shoot a film; Dahl wrote his famous children’s books in a little hut—his “nest”—at the edge of the garden, surrounded by the roses and rhododendrons he liked to tend. “It was a very unmanufactured garden—very cobbled together, not unlike the house,” Ophelia Dahl, the second-youngest of the siblings, recalled recently. “I remember Dad in the garden all the time. In the summer, he’d be standing there in the evening with a whiskey-and-soda. I remember sipping it, and saying, ‘Oh, God, this is a horrible taste!’ He told me, ‘I don’t drink it for the taste. I drink it for the nice whizzly feeling it gives you.’ ” There was a small orchard on the property, and Dahl taught Ophelia to drive there when she was only eleven years old. Like Dahl’s child hero in “Danny, the Champion of the World”—who lived with his widowed father in a Gypsy caravan, and started driving when he was nine—Ophelia was a brave and competent child, who soon took to driving around the village. “I often chose my friends for their moms, these warm, interesting moms, and I would drive over to these people’s houses, and, even if my friend wasn’t there, I’d stop in for a cup of tea and a chat.” The next day, she’d drive to another house, making her rounds. There was the palpable world of country roads and cocktails in the garden, and the fantastic world of stories that sprang from her father’s “delicious imagination.” But there was also a silent world of grief, a world that could not be seen or spoken of. The first great sadness had come in 1960, when the family was visiting Manhattan and a taxicab hit the carriage in which Neal and Dahl’s four-month-old son, Theo, was being wheeled by his nanny along Madison Avenue. The carriage flew forty feet, and the baby’s skull shattered when he landed. He underwent multiple surgeries, and a tube was implanted to drain fluid from his brain into his heart, but it kept getting blocked. At the height of Theo’s suffering, his father contacted Stanley Wade, a toymaker he knew who specialized in crafting engines for model airplanes with tiny hydraulic pumps. Together with Kenneth Till, a pediatric neurosurgeon who cared for Theo, they created the Dahl-Wade-Till shunt, which was used on almost three thousand children around the world, and cost a third as much as its predecessor, because the inventors declined to profit from it. Theo required nine craniotomies, but he lived. Two years after Theo’s accident, when Dahl was in the midst of writing a story he later called “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” his seven-year-old daughter, Olivia, contracted measles. Within four days, she was dead. “There was just this sense that my father’s heart had been fully broken,” Ophelia, who was born a year and a half after Olivia’s death, said. Neal grieved openly and outwardly. Dahl, on the other hand, “went to bed for something like a month, and then got up, but he couldn’t talk about it. My mother said he just never talked about it again.” More misfortune followed. When Ophelia was nine months old, Neal suffered a burst cerebral aneurysm and fell into a coma. She came out of it, but it took months for her to learn how to walk and talk again. “I have very strong memories growing up, of knowing immediately—as soon as I became conscious—that she had been ill, that she wasn’t like other mothers,” Ophelia said. “She would trip and fall regularly. I was on high alert most of my childhood.” But, if her mother fell, Ophelia could help her up. The other, deeper sorrows persisted, and there was nothing she could do about them. “I feel, in some ways, I was born into the echo of something that had happened at another time,” Ophelia, who is fifty-three, and has icy pale skin and green eyes and her mother’s delicate features, said. “There were clearly ramifications, but I hadn’t been there.” There were relics around Gipsy House of the losses: a trunk in Dahl and Neal’s room that contained Olivia’s clothes and toys; a prototype of the Dahl-Wade-Till shunt in a frame, hanging on the wall. “Funny old thing—looked like the inside of a watch,” Ophelia recalled. “He never talked about it with us. But my father never talked about his accomplishments. He did none of that boring stuff that people who look back on an accomplished life do.” Recently, Ophelia Dahl was in Rwanda, speaking to a group of graduate students at the University of Global Health Equity, which was opened in 2015 by Partners in Health, an aid organization that Dahl co-founded when she was very young. “For the first time in a lecture like that, I included my father as an example of the suggestion that you can transcend your training. Don’t do this thing where you say, ‘Well, I don’t know that that can be done.’ You have to keep pushing. You don’t say, ‘I’m sorry, I’m not an inventor, I’m a writer.’ I think it’s connected to feeling entitled in the right way: ‘Fuck it. I’m not going to stand for that.’ You push. You push, push, push.” In the final version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” Willy Wonka exhorts Grandpa Joe, “You mustn’t despair! Nothing is impossible!” On the Partners in Health Web site, the organization’s stated purpose is to bring the benefits of modern medical science to some of the poorest people in the world. (The group operates in Haiti, Peru, Mexico, Siberia, the Navajo Nation, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Lesotho, and Liberia, in addition to Rwanda.) But Partners in Health also aspires to do something more amorphous, more imaginative, and more improbable: “to serve as an antidote to despair.” There are, as people often say in Sierra Leone, “many challenges” at the government clinic in Kangama, near the country’s eastern border. It is situated many hours’ drive from the nearest town, on a rocky and frequently flooded dirt road through the bush, and few patients can afford a car or a motorcycle or even the fuel to power one. It is also difficult to reach by phone: there are no landlines in the area, so in order to make or receive calls a member of the clinic’s staff has to walk a mile to “the point”—a spot where there is intermittent cell-phone service. “It is often very frustrating,” Fodei Daboh, a tall young man who is the community health program manager, explained to Ophelia Dahl on an afternoon in October when she visited. Calls always seem to drop just when a plan—to get an ambulance, say—is on the verge of completion. There are shortages of medication in the clinic dispensary, and basic supplies often run out. On that day, there was a large jug of water by the front door, next to two posters touting the benefits of handwashing. There was not, however, any soap. What the Kangama clinic has plenty of is bathrooms: nine of them, built with aid money donated during the Ebola crisis of 2014. “The intent was good, but the lack of coördination was horrifying,” Regan Marsh, a former medical director of Partners in Health Sierra Leone, who had joined Dahl for the visit, said. They had seen this kind of thing all over the world. Development organizations will donate something finite, even if it’s redundant, rather than something essential but ongoing; thus, a community might receive a bathroom, a handwashing sign, or a thousand packets of oral-rehydration salts, instead of salaries for trained nurses, or, say, electricity. “There are endless examples of bigger interventions—like a hospital—in the middle of nowhere, and it falls apart because it hasn’t been built within a community of trained people, or with the normal pipeline for overhead and upkeep,” Dahl said. If a hospital is erected, but there is no running water or sewage system—to say nothing of diagnostic equipment or personnel who can operate it—it is as useless as a bucket of water without soap. Consequently, Partners in Health often helps supply things that fall outside a medical-aid organization’s typical purview, such as bridges and satellite dishes and gasoline. “These things need to be done in order for people to have a reasonable chance of being healthy,” Dahl said, “and not being . . . dead.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media When P.I.H. became involved with the Kangama clinic, a year and a half ago, there was no power at the facility. One of the basic functions of this sort of clinic is to care for women as they give birth, but if a woman went into labor at night she would have to deliver by flashlight. During the rainy season, someone had to hold an umbrella over the proceedings, because the ceiling leaked. There is electricity now, and the ceiling has been patched, but there is still no doctor on staff. In fact, there are only about a hundred and fifty Sierra Leonean doctors in the entire country—which helps explain why it is the most dangerous place in the world to be pregnant. One out of every seventeen women in Sierra Leone will die during a pregnancy, a delivery, or its aftermath. In the United States, the rate is one in thirty-eight hundred; in Finland and Italy, it’s one in twenty thousand. P.I.H. first came to West Africa in 2014, at the invitation of the governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, during the height of the Ebola epidemic. Emergency intervention is distinctly not P.I.H.’s project; in contrast with organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières, which specialize in addressing intense crises, P.I.H. works to remake entire health-care systems, by collaborating with local governments. Its commitments are long-term and large in scale. (One board member told me, “M.S.F. is sex. P.I.H. is love.”) P.I.H. has been in Rwanda for twelve years, and in Haiti for more than thirty. In Sierra Leone, Dahl and her colleagues were convinced that many people were dying of Ebola for the same reason that they were dying in childbirth: the lack of a functional health-care system. “Ebola was the canary in the coal mine,” Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer of P.I.H., told me. “What you’ve got to look at are the dangerous conditions in the mine.” Sierra Leone is still reeling from a decade-long civil war, and evidence of it is everywhere: the charred skeletons of homes, schools, and hospitals throughout the countryside; the omnipresence of people whose limbs were systematically amputated by the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front; the lack of basic infrastructure. There are twenty public hospitals in Sierra Leone, and less than half have running water. One Sierra Leonean doctor, T. B. Kamara, co-authored a study in 2010 comparing surgical care in his country with what was available in the United States during the Civil War. It concluded that the nineteenth-century U.S. facilities had been “equivalent and in many ways superior.” Dahl told me, “Ebola was ‘acute on chronic.’ That’s what they call it when someone has smoker’s lung, and then suddenly something precipitous happens, like pneumonia. It happens with systems themselves.” Dahl, who was the executive director of P.I.H. during the Ebola crisis and is now the chair of the board, had secured financial commitments from the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and from the British Department for International Development. P.I.H. workers began by establishing emergency-treatment centers, and moved to shore up major public hospitals. Then they began training and paying community health workers, which is usually P.I.H.’s first priority when it goes into a country. Local people are employed to visit sick neighbors and administer medications, take note of symptoms, and accompany patients to seek treatment at a nearby clinic. Ninety-six per cent of P.I.H. employees are residents of the communities where they work. That afternoon in Kangama, Dahl made the rounds with Sahr Christian Allieu, a community health worker who visits seven patients three times a week. The first, a pregnant woman who had recently been given a diagnosis of H.I.V., lived in a small settlement in the bush, and on the way there they walked past children outside their homes, pounding grain in wooden mortars as tall as they were, and past women balancing stacks of cassava leaves on their heads. When they arrived, the patient was wearing a white tank top stretched taut over her big belly and a vibrant red cloth knotted just below it. “How de body?” Dahl asked, using the local greeting. The woman put her hand on her stomach and said that she was feeling healthy, but that, with a fifteen-year-old, a five-year-old, and aging parents, she had “a lot of people to take care of.” She invited Dahl into her house, a three-room structure of mud bricks under a corrugated-tin roof, where she lived with twelve family members. “Imagine how wet it is sleeping on the floor during the rainy season,” Dahl said, outside. “In Haiti, they have a saying about these sorts of houses: they fool the sun but not the rain.” A few minutes’ walk through the bush, the next patient, who also had H.I.V., was gaunt and exhausted, with sunken eyes. She worried about how she would survive, she said. Her husband had abandoned her and their three children—including a baby she was still breastfeeding—when he found out that she had the disease. They were staying with her brother and eleven other people in a small house with no electricity or running water. She had been taking antiretroviral medication that her community health worker brought her, and her appetite was returning, but that only meant she was hungry; her brother had had difficulty feeding his extended family even before he took her in. “I don’t know how to thank God enough for the medications,” she said. “I wouldn’t be alive without them. That gives me some hope.” But even as she said this she stared at the floor, looking despondent. Dahl, visibly shaken, talked to Allieu afterward about getting her some food assistance. The medicine would do no good if the woman starved to death. When Dahl was eighteen, she decided to volunteer in Haiti with a nonprofit that provided eye care to the poor. “My father told me, ‘Go do something worthwhile, and have an adventure—see a different part of the world.’ ” It was a good time to leave Great Missenden, as her parents were on the verge of a painful and public divorce. For a cosseted teen-ager, arriving in Port-au-Prince proved to be transformational. “It was a fundamental sort of messing about with your own internal system,” Dahl said. “Everything was different—that’s what garbage smells like, that’s what illness smells like, that’s what children begging look like.” Most people encounter poverty and then relegate the knowledge of others’ misery to the periphery of their mind. Dahl had a different experience. “To have seen this and to not do anything, I knew wasn’t an option. I would never sleep well again. The rest of my life I’d then be feeling like, ‘Look at the house we’re living in.’ ” But she had no idea what effective action might entail. “I went to these outreach clinics in Haiti, and I was writing home, like, ‘Dear Dad, today I saw . . .’ And you would see things! I didn’t lie; I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I scrubbed in on some surgery.’ The implication, though, was that I was doing important things—because you want to believe that.” In a town called Mirebalais, in Haiti’s Central Plateau, she met another volunteer, an American named Paul Farmer, who had recently graduated from Duke with a degree in medical anthropology. Their upbringings were starkly different: Farmer was raised, with five siblings, in a bus in a Florida campground. (They joked that Farmer had grown up looking for diners where kids eat free, while Dahl went to places where kids eat Brie.) But they had the same yearning to improve the lives of the poor. “I knew I wanted to be a doctor,” Farmer said. “And I convinced her that she should be a doctor, too—which is something I wouldn’t do as a more mature person, but I was a twenty-three-year-old idiot.” Dahl didn’t see it that way. “It’s weird to use the word ‘mentor,’ because he also became my boyfriend,” she said. “But he was really pretty visionary. Paul said, ‘I know how to get there.’ And I said, ‘Well, I’m coming with you, babe.’ ” Dahl returned to England to take her A-levels, and Farmer enrolled at Harvard Medical School, but they would reconvene in Haiti, where Farmer continued to volunteer: he often flew there on Thursday nights after he finished classes for the week, and then returned to Cambridge on Monday mornings. The people he worked with had been flooded out of their farmland when a hydroelectric dam was built—water refugees, they called themselves—and were living in a squatter settlement called Cange, where they covered their shacks with banana leaves because they could not afford tin. Most families were afflicted with some kind of illness, in addition to malnutrition. Farmer was outraged that health policymakers did not see these people as worthy of the same standard of treatment as the wealthy. The prevailing idea was that prevention is better than cure—that aid should be focussed on vaccination and education, and that poor people should make do with what they had. “Already the field was polluted by health economists,” Farmer said. “When you hear things like ‘cost effective’ or ‘appropriate technology,’ they don’t come from the patients. Nobody says, ‘Hey, I’d really like you to build a cost-effective health-care facility in my squatter settlement.’ ” It seemed to him that his patients were being penalized by the global-health intelligentsia for being impoverished because of circumstances beyond their control. Dahl studied science, thinking that she, too, would go to medical school, which delighted her father, who thought of himself as a “frustrated doctor.” She joined Farmer in Haiti during summer breaks, and they stayed with Fritz Lafontant, a radical priest who had built the first school in the area. Together, they took a census in Cange, to find out how people lived and what was killing them. “We’d go off every morning at eight and walk for four or five hours on these little paths,” Dahl said. “Usually, there’d be a kid, and they’d run off and find an adult in the field, and we would explain what we were doing. They would open their door and make sure you were in the shade and often offer you some corn or a coconut. No one had fewer than six kids. Everyone had a dirt floor.” Stupid deaths, as the residents of Cange called them, were the norm; children died from diarrheal diseases, because there was no clean drinking water. “We started taking a little felt-tip pen to write a number on the doors so we could start a medical record and come back,” Dahl said. With Lafontant, they began to build a health-care system from the ground up. “Years later,” Farmer recalled, “I was at Roald’s seventieth-birthday party, and he said to me, ‘You guys like working in Haiti because you like being big fish in a small pond.’ I took umbrage, but he was probably right. And there’s a good reason—you can make a big difference in a place where there isn’t much.” Dahl raised some money from her parents’ friends in London, and bought scales for weighing malnourished infants. Farmer began training locals to recognize the symptoms of TB, malaria, and typhoid. These recruits were the first of many community health workers Farmer and Dahl relied on in remote areas; the Haitians called them accompagnateurs. Farmer also taught them to administer medication, a fair amount of which he finagled from Harvard and smuggled over in his suitcase. Crucially, Lafontant worked with an American church group to hire engineers to pipe water from the dammed river into a communal spigot. Almost immediately, the incidence of typhoid decreased. It reminded Dahl of the famous story of John Snow, the doctor in nineteenth-century London who traced a cholera outbreak to a particular pump on Broad Street by conducting a door-to-door census. After Snow persuaded the city council to remove the pump’s handle, people stopped dying, thus dispelling the idea that they’d got sick because they were poor and wretched and breathing “bad air.” In Boston, Farmer had befriended a retired construction magnate and Second World War veteran named Tom White, and he brought him to Haiti to see how people were living. White began donating money for such necessities as concrete floors and tin roofs, and ended up financing the construction of a clinic. “I was twenty at that point—I didn’t even have an undergraduate degree,” Dahl said. “Paul was a medical student. But we all sort of rolled up our sleeves and did whatever there was to do. We were planting trees on the hillside to try and stop the erosion. We were writing to people, long letters asking for money; driving to Port-au-Prince to pick up tons of things, like cough medicine and bar soap.” When the clinic opened, with three examining rooms staffed by Farmer and several Haitian doctors, patients poured in from all over the country—travelling on foot for days to reach them, sometimes carrying sick loved ones on their backs, sleeping outside while they waited their turn for care. “That’s how few the options were,” Dahl said. “It was tiny, but we left all this rebar sticking out the top because we knew that we would need to build more. The rebar sticking out felt like a beautiful thing, because it said, ‘We know this isn’t enough, not nearly—but it’s what we can do right now.’ ” In Cange, Dahl realized that there were ways besides being a doctor to improve the health of the poor. This was reassuring, because she had found that she was interested in science only up to a point. “I loved thinking about life cycles, or mosquitoes and how they’re connected to these tropical diseases and how a parasite goes through the liver of a sheep before it’s recirculated,” she said. “I mean, that stuff—that’s literature. That’s the poetry of systems.” Literature, ultimately, is what Dahl decided to study, at Wellesley College. In Boston, she and Farmer got an apartment together. “We would talk and talk and talk about what it was we were doing,” Dahl said. They believed passionately that their aid work was about “redistributive justice,” as Farmer put it to Tracy Kidder, who wrote a biography of him. Many development professionals advocated a doctrine of self-reliance, typified by the slogan “African solutions to African problems”—which Dahl and Farmer felt ignored the West’s role in creating those problems. “In the affluent world, history gets erased,” he told me. “Erasing history is unfair to some people, and it’s fine for others. At med school, nobody even talked about these things.” He sighed. “I hope I wasn’t uppity and sanctimonious to my classmates, but I probably was.” At Harvard, Farmer met Jim Yong Kim, a young man from a family of South Korean immigrants, who, like him, was pursuing a Ph.D. in anthropology along with a medical degree. With Dahl they formed a trio. “We all read liberation theology together, and Ophelia was sort of a keeper of the faith,” Kim, who is now the president of the World Bank, recalled. They were particularly taken with the Peruvian philosopher and priest Gustavo Gutiérrez’s conception of a “preferential option for the poor.” Because God favors the poor and the powerless, Gutiérrez argued, Christianity should focus on the injustices visited upon the destitute. To Dahl, Farmer, and Kim, it seemed clear that this doctrine applied to health care, too. “The thing about looking for some grand theory, like Marxism or whatever ‘ism,’ is that a lot of those sort of peter out or are eventually discredited,” Farmer said. “It was hard for me to see how you could discredit an injunction to serve poor people preferentially. You don’t have to be an epidemiologist to realize that infectious diseases make their own preferential option for the poor—they afflict them more, and worse.” Dahl, Kim, and Farmer drew up a mission statement for what they called “the Project.” They would work toward providing health care that prioritized poor people’s needs, rather than the cheapest or the easiest intervention. “You don’t say, ‘When I’m in Boston, I have this one set of standards, and when I’m in Haiti or Rwanda I’m just going to lower the shit out of them,’ ” Dahl said. Tom White, who had by then decided to systematically divest himself of his wealth, donated a million dollars of seed money. “We were not going to be a regular self-congratulatory do-gooder organization,” Kim said. “We were going to grapple with deep questions of responsibility. Ophelia was the one who could explain to all the people coming around why our approach was different.” Dahl had a knack for disarming defensive people and for convincing donors that the world’s most fortunate people had a moral obligation to investigate—and compensate for—the suffering that underlies their comfort. “If we can’t connect our own good fortune with the misfortune of others, then we’ve missed the boat completely,” she often said. But, soon after the organization came into being, Dahl and Farmer’s romance fell apart. In 1989, she sent a letter explaining why she would not marry him. “You pointed out to me once, during an emotional argument, that the qualities I love in you—that drew me to you—also cause me to resent you,” she wrote. “Namely your unswerving commitment to the poor, your limitless schedule and your massive compassion for others.” Farmer didn’t speak to Dahl for nine months. Then they ran into each other at a restaurant in Cambridge. “I looked up and I saw him,” Dahl recalled, “and there was this recognition—just knowing that you’ve always known each other, and that we understood why we had to be apart, but hoped not to be apart again.” “I’m still working with all the people I met then who are alive—because they’re willing to be involved!” Farmer told me. “The qualities you most need to do this are solidarity and empathy. Those are rare. Ophelia was, and is, exquisitely sensitive to other people’s suffering—she gets physically anguished about it. And that’s a wonderful thing to have.” In 2013, Partners in Health opened a two-hundred-thousand-square-foot, three-hundred-bed teaching hospital in Haiti—the largest solar-powered hospital in the world. It is in Mirebalais, where Farmer and Dahl first met. The economist William Easterly divides development agencies into two philosophically distinct groups: planners and searchers. In his 2006 book “The White Man’s Burden: Why the West’s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good,” he writes that the planner “thinks of poverty as a technical engineering problem” that can be solved with enough money, intelligence, ingenuity, and data. Searchers, by contrast, “are just on the lookout for favorable opportunities to solve problems—any problem, no matter how big or small.” The searcher sees that Cange needs a water spigot, or that Kangama needs an ambulance, and starts working to help obtain it. She may hope that eventually the strategy—and the money—will emerge to provide the entire region or nation or continent with water and ambulances. But she doesn’t wait for it. Especially in the early years, Dahl said, “we adopted this stance that we’re not the experts—you tell us how we can accompany you.” But, as the clinic in Cange was overwhelmed by demand, it became clear that it was not enough to conduct a neighborhood census: they needed to partner with governments, so that the work they did could be coördinated and sustainable. “If you believe health care is a right, then you have to work with governments, because they are the only group that can confer rights,” Dahl said. “Ninety-nine per cent of people, the first thing they ask is, ‘What about corruption?’ It’s an easy nugget to grab on to. ‘There’s nothing to be done. Let’s sleep now, free from worry.’ ” Though P.I.H. won’t collaborate with a government that is dictatorial or hopelessly dysfunctional, it expects to have to work around patronage systems. “It’s not that we’re crazy bleeding hearts that just choose not to see any of this stuff,” Dahl continued. “It’s just that we don’t let it be a showstopper. Imagine if we shut things down whenever there was corruption in the United States: ‘Sorry, now you can’t have any health care.’ ” This reasoning reminded her of another common accusation: that white, Western people doing aid work in poor countries are practicing a kind of latter-day colonialism. “It’s often used as a not very eloquent excuse to do nothing,” she said. “It brings out the worst in one. You feel like saying, ‘So what are you doing?’ ” In 2014, a Sierra Leonean doctor name Bailor Barrie persuaded the country’s President to write a letter to P.I.H., asking the group to come to West Africa. Ebola was spreading rapidly, and Barrie knew firsthand how ill-equipped the health-care system was, even before the burgeoning crisis. In 2006, he’d started a clinic in Kono District, to serve the thousands of amputees in the region. Kono, the most diamond-rich area in Sierra Leone, was the base of the rebel army, and thus the region hardest hit by the war. “When I moved to Kono, we went to the government hospital and there was nothing—no beds, patients were lying on the floor, no doctors, only volunteer nurses,” Barrie, a round man of thirty-eight, told me. He started volunteering at the hospital, seeing patients every morning; he’d work the rest of the day at his clinic, Well Body, and sleep there at night. He had read about the success that Partners in Health had with community health workers achieving early diagnosis and treatment of H.I.V. in remote places, and so he obtained training materials from Joia Mukherjee. “I thought the P.I.H. model in Rwanda and Haiti was great, so we wanted to replicate it.” In 2013, he moved to Boston, on a Fulbright Fellowship, to pursue a master’s degree in global health at Harvard. “I went back to Sierra Leone to do my research,” Barrie said. “And then Ebola struck.” P.I.H. agreed to come to Sierra Leone partly because it was an opportunity to partner with a functional government on a dysfunctional health-care system, and partly because it had an invaluable accomplice in Bailor Barrie. Barrie had wanted to be a doctor since he was six years old, but there was no medical school in Sierra Leone then, and going abroad to get an education was out of the question: his father was a village tailor who earned less than a cent a day. In 1988, the country’s first medical school opened, in Freetown, and, when Barrie took the entrance exam, he got the highest marks in the country. He moved to Freetown, and, in 1996, he started school. But his plan was derailed by the war. When classes began, his mother had recently been captured by the rebels. “We thought she was dead—we had a ceremony and everything,” he said. The rebels forced her to work as a cook and a porter, but when she got an infection they left her behind to die. She was found during Barrie’s first year of medical school and reunited with her family, but the following year the rebels shot his father, who died soon after. The year after that, they staged a coup in Freetown, and Barrie soon fled to a refugee camp in Guinea, where he remained for eight months. When he heard that the medical school had reopened, he returned, but then had to flee again when the rebels invaded, in a strike they called Operation No Living Thing. It took eight years of stopping and starting before Barrie graduated. One humid morning in October, Barrie accompanied Dahl and Regan Marsh, the former medical director, on a visit to Well Body. A man named Mani Kanda opened the gate to greet them. His right arm had been amputated at the elbow, and hadn’t healed properly. Asked if he had pain in his arm, he said, “Yes—in my good arm, because it does all the work.” Since the Ebola treatment centers closed and P.I.H. has been focussed on the slower task of over-all system building, the organization has been partnering with Barrie at Well Body to create a model clinic for maternal health. Dozens of mothers with babies strapped to their backs waited to have the children weighed and checked. Dressed in the bright oranges, purples, and blues of traditional fabrics, the women were a blaze of color, except for a few wearing black Islamic robes. (The population of Sierra Leone is divided between Christians and Muslims, who are markedly unconcerned by their differences. They intermarry and attend one another’s religious services; Christian families send children to Islamic schools.) In an open-air pavilion, a group of about fifty pregnant women stood listening to a clinical assistant in green scrubs and Crocs. “If you are sick, don’t do country medicine, don’t take herbs,” she told them in Krio, the country’s most common language. “If you don’t feel well, come here, where we measure our medicine. Don’t go to the mommy who is your neighbor. If you come here, nothing bad will happen to you.” Many of the women had had negative experiences, Barrie explained. “There is a lack of trust. In the past, at the government hospital, the clinical staff was yelling at patients. They were always angry, because they never got paid.” The government of Sierra Leone, hoping to reduce the grim levels of maternal mortality, passed a law fining traditional birth attendants who were caught delivering babies in homes. But many women are reluctant to deliver at a clinic or a hospital. “When you go to the clinic for the first time and you don’t receive good care, you think, Next time, you know what? I’ll go to the traditional healer,” Barrie said. “If I pay the small money I have to get to the hospital and they don’t have the drugs and I’ve used my money to pay transport, next time I’ll go to the traditional birth attendant who delivered a lot of the babies in the village.” “And if there are no tools and no nurses at the hospital,” Dahl added, “the birth attendants may have as much experience as the staff.” Well Body employs traditional birth attendants from neighboring communities as support staff. “Women trust the T.B.A.s,” Barrie continued. “If they see them here, they feel they can tell them their problems.” In the maternity ward, two T.B.A.s in scrubs stood next to an effervescent young nurse from Freetown named N’damba Mansaray. Dahl asked the attendants what they’d learned to do differently from their training. One attendant explained that she used to take women who were having prolonged labor out into the bush, to give them privacy from the men in their family while they delivered, and that she had cut umbilical cords with razors that weren’t sterilized. Asked if there was anything they’d taught the staff at the clinic, the two women grew shy. “They help with the language barrier, and they know how to talk to the patients,” Mansaray said. “And I have learned Kono music from them, to sing for my patients when they are in pain!” She started singing, and the other women joined in. Together, they made a sound so enveloping that it was easy to imagine how it might comfort you and transport you during the most frightening moments of a birth. “It means, ‘With God, all things are possible,’ ” Mansaray said. Once women decide to seek treatment, two major obstacles contribute to maternal mortality. The first is the time it takes to reach a medical facility. Adjacent to the clinic, P.I.H. built an airy room with mosquito nets over the beds, where women in high-risk groups can stay as their due date approaches. On that day, a teen-age girl and a woman with a spinal abnormality that could make delivery dangerous sat chatting on the stoop, while a cook, an old man in a rain slicker, made groundnut stew over a charcoal fire for their lunch. The second obstacle is the delay while the staff of a facility makes a decision about treatment—usually whether to perform a Cesarean section—and implements it. “In the United States, decision to incision is about fifteen minutes,” Marsh said. “In Sierra Leone, it is not uncommon for a woman to arrive at ten at night and have to wait for a nurse until ten in the morning.” One of the first things that P.I.H. did at the hospital to which Well Body refers difficult cases—after fixing the electricity to keep the lights on overnight—was to set up a twenty-four-hour rotation for staff. In the clinic, Jonathan Lascher, the executive director of P.I.H. Sierra Leone, joined the group. A thirty-four-year-old Peace Corps veteran from upstate New York, he is a wiry, energetic man, who has gone prematurely “P.I.H. gray” in his hair and beard. “These things are solvable,” he said. “We don’t need Elon Musk to design some cool new innovation for us.” The leading cause of maternal death in Sierra Leone is hemorrhage, which in Western hospitals can be addressed by routine procedures. In America, depictions of the Ebola epidemic often featured startling images of bleeding victims. In fact, most patients did not display hemorrhagic symptoms. The majority of Sierra Leonean women who die in childbirth, however, simply bleed to death. As a young woman, Dahl imagined that she’d have four children. She ended up having one, at the age of forty-three. “Things don’t go absolutely as planned—and I am in a relationship with a woman, so there’s no accidental pregnancy,” Dahl told a interviewer for PBS several years ago. “Then you feel enormously lucky to be able to go to that kind of trouble to have a child.” Dahl’s partner of nineteen years, Lisa Frantzis, is a senior vice-president at Advanced Energy Economy, an organization that promotes policies to expand clean-power technologies. They live in a stately town house in Cambridge, and one warm afternoon this fall their ten-year-old son, Luke, was climbing a tree in the back yard while Dahl filled a bowl with organic raspberries in the kitchen. She was a little tired, because she’d been out late the previous evening, having dinner with two hedge-fund donors at a nearby restaurant, where she’d helped them select several good bottles of wine. “I’m a sybarite at heart,” she said, popping a berry in her mouth. She took the fruit onto the porch. “Ophelia, can we go to the hardware store later?” her son yelled from the tree. “I need to get a crank.” “You live with a crank,” she said. He went back to climbing. When Dahl was helping to found P.I.H., she sometimes explained its mission by saying that its members would treat patients like their own family—that each case deserved the dogged inventiveness a mother would marshal to save her child’s life. “Being visionary isn’t just something you’re born with,” Dahl told me. “We can all do it for our own children.” In the early nineties, P.I.H. began hearing about a vexing group of tuberculosis sufferers in Lima, Peru. At the time, the Peruvians were thought to have the best tuberculosis program in the world. “They were the darling of the global TB community,” Jim Kim told me. They had dramatically improved cure rates using a protocol called “directly observed therapy” to administer antibiotics. But the patients that P.I.H. was hearing about never got better, no matter how many times they were treated. Their illness was known as multidrug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB. P.I.H. wanted to start treating the disease, using “second-line” antibiotics, which were more expensive and difficult to procure. Peruvian authorities said that P.I.H. would be expelled from the country if it attempted to do so. Peru was adhering to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the arm of the United Nations that sets global policy, which had concluded that MDR-TB ought to be left to “run its course,” because it was too difficult to treat. “But ‘Let it burn itself out’ and ‘It’s not as virulent as regular TB’ are just dishonest arguments,” Farmer said. “Honest would be ‘These people are not as important as we are, so let them die.’ ” The daughter of an official at the Ministry of Health in Lima became sick, and the man asked if Farmer would treat her with second-line antibiotics. He agreed, and the child got well. “The only reason that we weren’t kicked out of the country is because that Ministry of Health official whispered to Paul, ‘Will you treat her?’ ” Dahl recalled. “He had helped to make that policy: ‘It wasn’t worth it to try and treat.’ But then your own child gets it? And then gets well?” Tom White, who died in 2011, was again willing to finance a P.I.H. experiment. He paid as much as thirty-five thousand dollars a patient for the drugs, which were administered to people in their homes by community health workers. Eighty-three per cent of the patients who took part in the experiment were cured. “So we won that argument,” Kim continued. “But then it was: Even if you can do it, the meds cost too much.” It occurred to Kim that nobody had bothered to check whether the drugs were off patent. They were. P.I.H. coördinated with several other organizations to get generic versions manufactured in China and India: suddenly, MDR-TB could be treated for ten per cent of the cost. While P.I.H. was working on tuberculosis in Lima, it was also securing a partnership with Harvard Medical School, where Kim and Farmer had become professors. “We were changing from a grassroots group,” Dahl said. “Our evidence had been anecdotal, but if you have academics who are part of the Harvard system woven into P.I.H., then you have the research to substantiate it and say ‘It’s possible to treat MDR-TB—therefore it must be done.’ ” Harvard and P.I.H. received a forty-four-million-dollar grant from the Gates Foundation to treat MDR-TB in Peru. “It was one of our first major inflection points as an organization,” Dahl said. In 2002, the World Health Organization amended its policy to acknowledge that MDR-TB should be treated. “I was actually sitting in the room at the W.H.O.,” Kim said. “I sent a note around to our colleagues that said, ‘Today the world changed.’ ” (Farmer sees it differently. “Jim is always thinking the world changes because a policy shifts, but I’m around these people who are saying, ‘My mother coughed up blood,’ ” he said. “There are a hundred thousand new cases a year just in China!”) Dahl took over as executive director of P.I.H. in 2001, working out of a room at Harvard Medical School with eight employees and an annual budget of twelve million dollars. As the group’s initiatives grew more ambitious, she had to decide whether to make use of public-sector funding. “It was a wrenching decision,” she recalled. For years, P.I.H. had argued that the United States had helped keep impoverished postcolonial nations from advancing, by making loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund contingent on such “structural adjustments” as diverting funds from public health and education to infrastructure. “To then turn around and take the money from the U.S. government felt tricky for us,” Dahl said. “But this is just as aids was ravaging Haiti. The physicians there said, ‘When you hear the knocking on your door of patients with this disease, which is all we hear, all day . . .’ I felt sort of ashamed. Like, oh, my God—what was I thinking?” P.I.H. accepted initial funding of $2.8 million from the Global Fund and $3.9 million from the President’s Emergency Plan for aids Relief (pepfar) under George W. Bush. “But we negotiated to get the money from the C.D.C., rather than through the State Department,” Dahl said, and laughed. Dahl and her co-workers came up with a broad interpretation of what it meant to treat aids. “We made a strategic decision—we’re going to use that money to revitalize the public sector, because that’s where people get care,” Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer, recalled. “We didn’t say, ‘To hell with the rules,’ ” Dahl was quick to interject. “You can go to jail if you spend government money improperly. But we knew if we were going to do this successfully we were going to have to expand the definition of what they meant.” Dahl was questioned at one point about using pepfar money to drill a well in Haiti. “We said, ‘How will they swallow their pills if they don’t have any clean water?’ ” The line item was approved. “Our Haitian colleagues had a term for what we were doing,” Dahl went on. “Chwal batay. It means Trojan horse.” Contained within their plan for treating H.I.V. was a plan to treat everything. “Over thirty years, we may have changed, or gone to new countries, decided that we were going to work with governments—but if you really adhere to our mission, it means that more and more things have to fit on our platform,” Dahl said. “This is why we’re involved in training, and starting universities, and capacity-building in all kinds of ways.” During the fifteen years that Dahl was executive director, P.I.H.’s revenue increased tenfold. “We have often had to fight this idea that P.I.H. is gold-plated,” she continued. “ ‘You’re the Cadillac,’ people would say. We’re really not. What we’re fighting for is spending something like a hundred dollars per person on health. In Boston, it’s probably ten thousand dollars!” In Dahl’s kitchen, with its gleaming granite countertops, was a wrought-iron sign that she had salvaged from Gipsy House—a relic of Great Missenden. “I know what it is to have a lovely life,” she said. “I know what it is to be able to take Luke to a really good hospital. But, more than that, I know what it is to luxuriate: to plant a tree and assume we’ll be able to see it every year. I don’t want to not be able to do that, but I don’t think it’s possible to do without knowing about all the inequity.” She shook her head. “The idea that we live in somehow different worlds calms us all: First World, Second World, Third World. It’s all one world.” Rising from the low skyline of Koidu, the capital of Kono District, is what appears to be a mountain with its top sheared off but is actually the pile of rubble that has accumulated around Sierra Leone’s largest diamond mine. The wealth that has been extracted from it fuelled the civil war, and also paid for the mercenary group Executive Outcomes to help reclaim the land from rebels; the mine now enriches an Israeli businessman named Beny Steinmetz, who was reported by Forbes in 2017 to have a net worth of $1.1 billion. Locals in Koidu have managed to find a way to make money from the mine, though: at all hours of the day, the tower of rubble is crawling with human beings who are mostly too poor to afford shoes, hauling rocks down in empty gas cans or one by one, then cracking them by hand to make gravel that they can sell for pennies. The rubble is its own economy, its own tiny, merciless system. One evening at dusk, Dahl walked around the mine, past families sorting the gravel they’d made into piles of different-sized stones. She was struck—again—by how it is always the poorest people, with the least access to care, who are the most exposed to injury and illness. “If we got in line together, there’s no question about who is always first in that line,” she said. She remembered the time she spent at a treatment center during the Ebola epidemic, and what it felt like to know that if she got infected she would be airlifted to one of the best hospitals in the world, while the Africans around her would likely die. William Easterly, the economist, pointed to a fundamental difficulty with P.I.H.’s approach. “If you’ve said, ‘There’s a right to health care,’ you haven’t said whose obligation it is to provide it,” he told me. “From an economist’s point of view, that’s kind of fatal. That is the major flaw of positive rights: Who is to blame if they’re not met?” A moral imperative is not the same as a financial solution. Regan Marsh, who spent four weeks wearing spacesuit-like protective gear to treat Ebola patients, said that, as P.I.H. was getting involved in Sierra Leone, Dahl handled government agencies with trepidation: “Ophelia was sitting with people saying, ‘O.K., we will do this, but we are not a disaster-relief program. We will come only if you say that you are going to stay.’ Everyone said, ‘Yes, yes, we will be your partner to put a health system in here.’ And then, as soon as Ebola appeared to be stabilized, the money evaporated.” Dahl told me that you could “hear the sucking sound” as aid was pulled out of West Africa in the wake of the disease. “But, without an effective health-care system, it’s a matter of time before it resurfaces.” It was crucial, Dahl said, that during crises people could count on organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières—“I mean, thank God for M.S.F.”—to set up self-contained triage units. But it was frustratingly difficult to persuade donors that long-term solutions are as necessary as emergency intervention. M.S.F. receives more than a billion dollars a year from donors, whereas P.I.H. takes in about seventy million. (Both organizations have four-star ratings, the highest, from Charity Navigator.) P.I.H. Sierra Leone started with an annual budget of seventeen million dollars, which has declined to five million, as donations have trailed off. “I wish we had more money,” Dahl said. “The idea that we’re constrained because we can’t find enough money, and not because we’ve failed to adapt. . . . But that’s what money forces you to do: make a series of terrible tradeoffs.” P.I.H. has had to pull out of one of the two hospitals it supported during Ebola. Koidu Government Hospital, where it has remained, is now the best in Sierra Leone. But, as Dahl put it, “the bar is so incredibly fucking low”—the hospital still doesn’t have an intensive-care unit. In Kangama, they’re seeing modest gains, which they’d like to extend to four other clinics in the district, but there are thirteen other districts where they can’t afford to start reifying systems. Like the first clinic in Cange, built with rebar sticking out, it is not nearly enough; it is what they can do right now. The next morning, at the Shine On Guesthouse, Dahl was still thinking over the problem, as she had breakfast with Regan Marsh and Jonathan Lascher. “That systems piece gets the hell in the way for people,” she said. “People go to sleep when we talk about systems. They switch off! ‘Oh, that’s too complicated.’ When it involves money and companies, it can always be done. Think about the airline industry—which really got going after the Second World War! Can you imagine how complicated it is to run a passenger air system across this world? None of this stuff, if it’s related to profits of companies, is too complicated.” I pointed out that the lack of a profit motive is precisely why many people doubt that social justice is even possible. Dahl looked crestfallen. She was silent for a moment and then said, “So that’s it?” “We are never going to convince everyone you should care,” Lascher said. “But this is why I think it’s important that we have people like Paul and Ophelia, who’ve been doing this for thirty-plus years, who have not shifted their belief that we should continue to push back against that narrative: ‘Appropriate technology.’ ‘African solutions for African problems.’ All of the things that have failed poor people over and over again. We have people who believe they can change the system by just doing it, by saying, ‘It doesn’t matter if you believe that a cholera vaccine is a waste of money. We’re going to do it because it’s the right thing to do.’ And then the World Health Organization—and everybody else—will change their minds.” Thirty years of experience has not made persevering any easier for Dahl. “This work feels more crushing and sadder to me than it’s ever felt—you see all the ways in which you’ve failed to do certain things, even though there’s incremental progress,” she said. “I am unfailingly optimistic, though. I think to not be optimistic is just about the most privileged thing you can be. If you can be pessimistic, you are basically deciding that there’s no hope for a whole group of people who can’t afford to think that way.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Is Health Care a Right?,41903,"Is health care a right? The United States remains the only developed country in the world unable to come to agreement on an answer. Earlier this year, I was visiting Athens, Ohio, the town in the Appalachian foothills where I grew up. The battle over whether to repeal, replace, or repair the Affordable Care Act raged then, as it continues to rage now. So I began asking people whether they thought that health care was a right. The responses were always interesting. A friend had put me in touch with a forty-seven-year-old woman I’ll call Maria Dutton. She lived with her husband, Joe, down a long gravel driveway that snaked into the woods off a rural road. “You may feel like you are in the movie ‘Deliverance,’ ” she said, but it wasn’t like that at all. They had a tidy, double-wide modular home with flowered wallpaper, family pictures on every surface, a vase of cut roses on a sideboard, and an absurdly friendly hound in the yard. Maria told me her story sitting at the kitchen table with Joe. She had joined the Army out of high school and married her recruiter—Joe is eleven years older—but after a year she had to take a medical discharge. She had developed severe fatigue, double vision, joint and neck pains, and muscle weakness. At first, doctors thought that she had multiple sclerosis. When that was ruled out, they were at a loss. After Joe left the military, he found steady, secure work as an electrical technician at an industrial plant nearby. Maria did secretarial and office-manager jobs and had a daughter. But her condition worsened, and soon she became too ill to work. “I didn’t even have enough energy to fry a pound of hamburger,” she said. “I’d have to fry half of it and then sit down, rest, and get up and fry the rest. I didn’t have enough energy to vacuum one room of the house.” Eventually, she was diagnosed with chronic-fatigue syndrome and depression. She became addicted to the opioids prescribed for her joint pains and was started on methadone. Her liver began to fail. In 2014, she was sent two hundred miles away to the Cleveland Clinic for a liver-transplant evaluation. There, after more than two decades of Maria’s deteriorating health, doctors figured out what the problem was: sarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition that produces hardened nodules in organs throughout the body. The doctors gave her immunosuppressive medication, and the nodules shrank away. Within a year, she had weaned herself off the methadone. “It was miraculous,” she said. In middle age, with her daughter grown up and in the Army Reserves herself, Maria got her life back and returned to school. All along, she’d had coverage through her husband’s work. “They have amazing insurance,” she said. “I think one year the insurance paid out two hundred thousand dollars. But we paid out, too.” This was an understatement. Between a six-thousand-dollar deductible and hefty co-pays and premiums, the Duttons’ annual costs reached fifteen thousand dollars. They were barely getting by. Then one day in 2001 Joe blacked out, for no apparent reason, at a Girl Scout meeting for their daughter and fell down two flights of stairs, resulting in a severe concussion. It put him out of work for six months. Given the health-care costs and his loss of income, the couple ran out of money. “We had to file for bankruptcy,” Joe said. He told me this reluctantly. It took them more than five years to dig out of the hole. He considered the bankruptcy “pretty shameful,” he said, and had told almost no one about it, not even his family. (This was why they didn’t want me to use their names.) He saw it as a personal failure—not the government’s. In fact, the whole idea that government would get involved in the financing of health care bothered him. One person’s right to health care becomes another person’s burden to pay for it, he said. Taking other people’s money had to be justified, and he didn’t see how it could be in cases like this. “Everybody has a right to access health care,” he allowed, “but they should be contributing to the cost.” He pointed out that anyone could walk into a hospital with an emergency condition, get treated, and be billed afterward. “Yes, they may have collectors coming after them,” he said. “But I believe everybody should contribute for the treatment they receive.” Like her husband, Maria leans conservative. In the 2016 election, Joe voted for Donald Trump. Maria voted for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. But on health care she was torn. Joe wanted Obamacare repealed. She didn’t. “I am becoming more liberal,” she said. “I believe that people should be judged by how they treat the least of our society.” At her sickest, she had been one of them. But she was reluctant to say that health care is a right. “There’s where the conservative side comes in and says, ‘You know what? I work really hard. I deserve a little more than the guy who sits around.’ ” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? A right makes no distinction between the deserving and the undeserving, and that felt perverse to Maria and Joe. They both told me about people they know who don’t work and yet get Medicaid coverage with no premiums, no deductibles, no co-pays, no costs at all—coverage that the Duttons couldn’t dream of. “I see people on the same road I live on who have never worked a lick in their life,” Joe said, his voice rising. “They’re living on disability incomes, and they’re healthier than I am.” Maria described a relative who got disability payments and a Medicaid card for a supposedly bad back, while taking off-the-books roofing jobs. “Frankly, it annoys the crap out of me—they’re nothing but grasshoppers in the system,” Joe said, recalling the fable about the thriftless grasshopper and the provident ant. The Duttons were doing all they could to earn a living and pay their taxes—taxes that helped provide free health care for people who did nothing to earn it. Meanwhile, they faced thousands of dollars in medical bills themselves. That seemed wrong. And in their view government involvement had only made matters worse. “My personal opinion is that anytime the government steps in and says, ‘You must do this,’ it’s overstepping its boundaries,” Joe said. “A father, mother, two kids working their asses off—they’re making minimum wage and are barely getting by—I have no problem helping them. If I have someone who’s spent his whole life a drunk and a wastrel, no, I have no desire to help. That’s just the basics.” Such feelings are widely shared. They’re what brought the country within a single vote of repealing major parts of President Obama’s expansion of health-care coverage. Some people see rights as protections provided by government. But others, like the Duttons, see rights as protections from government. Tim Williams, one of my closest childhood friends, disagreed with the Duttons. Tim is a quiet fifty-two-year-old with the physique of a bodybuilder—he once bench-pressed me when we were in high school—and tightly cropped gray hair that used to be flame red. He survived metastatic melanoma, in the nineties, and losing his job selling motorcycles, during the great recession. He went through a year of chemotherapy and, later, three years without a job. He can figure out how to fix and build almost anything, but, without a college degree, he had few employment options. Hundreds of job applications later, though, he was hired as an operator at our town’s water-treatment plant, where I visited him. The plant was built in the nineteen-fifties. We walked among giant pipes and valves and consoles that controlled the flow of water from local ground wells through a series of huge pools for filtration, softening, and chlorination, and out to the water towers on the tallest ridges surrounding the town. The low hum of the pump motors churned in the background. People don’t think about their water, Tim said, but we can’t live without it. It is not a luxury; it’s a necessity of human existence. An essential function of government, therefore, is to insure that people have clean water. And that’s the way he sees health care. Joe wanted government to step back; Tim wanted government to step up. The divide seemed unbridgeable. Yet the concerns that came with each viewpoint were understandable, and I wondered if there were places where those concerns might come together. Before I entered the field of public health, where it’s a given that health care is a right and not a privilege, I had grown up steeped in a set of core Midwestern beliefs: that you can’t get something for nothing, and that you should be reluctant to impose on others and, likewise, to be imposed upon. Here self-reliance is a totemic value. Athens, Ohio, is a place where people brew their own beer, shoot their own deer, fix their own cars (also grow their own weed, fight their own fights, get their own revenge). People here are survivors. Monna French was one. She was fifty-three years old and the librarian at Athens Middle School. She’d been through a lot in life. She had started a local taxi company with her first husband, but they couldn’t afford health insurance. When she gave birth to her daughter Maggie and then to her son, Mac, the couple had to pay cash, pray that there’d be no unaffordable complications, and try to leave the hospital the next morning to avoid extra charges. When Monna and her husband divorced, litigation over the business left her with no income or assets. “I had twenty-six dollars, two kids, and a cat,” she said. She held down five part-time jobs, working as a teaching assistant for three different schools during the day, bartending at night, and selling furniture at Odd Lots department store on weekends, while her parents helped with the kids. Finally, she got the librarian job. It was classified as clerical work and didn’t pay well. But it meant that her family had health insurance, and a roof over their heads. She also met Larry, an iron worker and Vietnam veteran, who became her second husband. He had two children, but he was older and they were grown. Together, Monna and Larry had a child of their own, named Macie. Then, thirteen years ago, Maggie, at age sixteen, was killed in a car accident. Seven years ago, Larry’s son, Eric, who had spina bifida and multiple medical needs, died suddenly in his sleep, at the age of forty. After twenty-two years as a librarian, Monna still makes only sixteen dollars and fifty cents an hour. Her take-home pay is less than a thousand dollars a month, after taxes and health-insurance contributions. Her annual deductible is three thousand dollars. Larry, now seventy-four, has retired, and his pension, military benefits, and Medicare helped keep them afloat. For all her struggles, though, Monna is the kind of person who is always ready to offer a helping hand. When I visited her, there were stacks of posters on her porch, printed for a fund-raiser she was organizing for her daughter’s high-school marching band. She raised money for her township’s volunteer fire brigade. She was the vice-president of her local union, one of the largest in the county, which represents school-bus drivers, clerical staff, custodians, and other non-certified workers. She’d been deeply involved in contract negotiations to try to hold on to their wages and health benefits in the face of cutbacks. “I don’t know anything about health care,” she protested when I asked her for her thoughts on the subject. In fact, she knew a lot. And, as she spoke, I thought I glimpsed a place where the health-care divide might just allow a bridge. Monna considered herself a conservative. The notion of health care as a right struck her as another way of undermining work and responsibility: “Would I love to have health insurance provided to me and be able to stay home?” Of course, she said. “But I guess I’m going to be honest and tell you that I’m old school, and I’m not really good at accepting anything I don’t work for.” She could quit her job and get Medicaid free, she pointed out, just as some of her neighbors had. “They have a card that comes in the mail, and they get everything they need!” she said. “Where does it end? I mean, how much responsibility do tax-paying people like me have? How much is too much?” She went on, “I understand that there’s going to be a percentage of the population that we are going to have to provide for.” When she was a young mother with two children and no home, she’d had to fall back on welfare and Medicaid for three months. Her stepson, Eric, had been on Medicaid and Social Security Disability Insurance before he died. Her eighty-three-year-old mother, who has dementia and requires twenty-four-hour care, was also on Medicaid. “If you’re disabled, if you’re mentally ill, fine, I get it,” Monna said. “But I know so many folks on Medicaid that just don’t work. They’re lazy.” Like the Duttons, she felt that those people didn’t deserve what they were getting. But then we talked about Medicare, which provided much of her husband’s health care and would one day provide hers. That was different, Monna told me. Liberals often say that conservative voters who oppose government-guaranteed health care and yet support Medicare are either hypocrites or dunces. But Monna, like almost everyone I spoke to, understood perfectly well what Medicare was and was glad to have it. I asked her what made it different. “We all pay in for that,” she pointed out, “and we all benefit.” That made all the difference in the world. From the moment we earn an income, we all contribute to Medicare, and, in return, when we reach sixty-five we can all count on it, regardless of our circumstances. There is genuine reciprocity. You don’t know whether you’ll need more health care than you pay for or less. Her husband thus far has needed much less than he’s paid for. Others need more. But we all get the same deal, and, she felt, that’s what makes it O.K. “I believe one hundred per cent that Medicare needs to exist the way it does,” she said. This was how almost everyone I spoke to saw it. To them, Medicare was less about a universal right than about a universal agreement on how much we give and how much we get. Understanding this seems key to breaking the current political impasse. The deal we each get on health care has a profound impact on our lives—on our savings, on our well-being, on our life expectancy. In the American health-care system, however, different people get astonishingly different deals. That disparity is having a corrosive effect on how we view our country, our government, and one another. The Oxford political philosopher Henry Shue observed that our typical way of looking at rights is incomplete. People are used to thinking of rights as moral trump cards, near-absolute requirements that all of us can demand. But, Shue argued, rights are as much about our duties as about our freedoms. Even the basic right to physical security—to be free of threats or harm—has no meaning without a vast system of police departments, courts, and prisons, a system that requires extracting large amounts of money and effort from others. Once costs and mechanisms of implementation enter the picture, things get complicated. Trade-offs now have to be considered. And saying that something is a basic right starts to seem the equivalent of saying only, “It is very, very important.” Shue held that what we really mean by “basic rights” are those which are necessary in order for us to enjoy any rights or privileges at all. In his analysis, basic rights include physical security, water, shelter, and health care. Meeting these basics is, he maintained, among government’s highest purposes and priorities. But how much aid and protection a society should provide, given the costs, is ultimately a complex choice for democracies. Debate often becomes focussed on the scale of the benefits conferred and the costs extracted. Yet the critical question may be how widely shared these benefits and costs are. Arnold Jonas is another childhood friend of mine. Blond, ruddy-faced, and sporting a paunch at fifty-two, he has rarely had a nine-to-five job and isn’t looking for one. The work he loves is in art and design—he once designed a project for the Smithsonian—but what usually pays the bills is physical labor or mechanical work. He lives from paycheck to paycheck. (“Retirement savings? Ha! You’re funny, Atul.”) Still, he has always known how to take care of himself. “I own my house,” he told me. “I have no debts.” This is a guy who’s so handy that the cars he drives are rehabbed wrecks rebuilt from spare parts—including the old Volvo that he drove to the strip-mall Mexican restaurant near my family’s house, where we were catching up. But when I asked him about health care he could only shake his head. “I just try not to think about it,” he said. He hadn’t seen a doctor in at least a decade. He got a health-care plan through an insurance-agent friend, but could only afford one with minimal benefits. He wasn’t sure whether he’d got an Obamacare subsidy. “I don’t read the fine print, because it’s going to be completely confusing anyway.” All he knew was that the plan cost him a hundred and ten dollars a month, and the high deductible (however many thousands of dollars it was, it was well beyond his savings account) made doctors’ visits almost out of the question. “I am lucky I can get my teeth looked at because I’m dating a dental hygienist. But”—here he showed me his white-toothed grin—“I can’t date a dental hygienist and a cardiologist.” Arnold, with his code of self-reliance, had eliminated nearly all sources of insecurity from his life. But here was one that was beyond his control. “The biggest worry I have would be some sort of health-care need,” he said. A serious medical issue would cost him his income. As an independent contractor, he isn’t eligible for unemployment benefits. And, having passed the age of fifty, he was just waiting for some health problem to happen. So did he feel that he had a right to health care? No. “I never thought about it as a matter of rights,” he said. “A lot of these things we think are rights, we actually end up paying for.” He thinks that the left typically plays down the reality of the costs, which drives him crazy. But the right typically plays down the reality of the needs, which drives him crazy, too. In his view, everyone has certain needs that neither self-reliance nor the free market can meet. He can fix his house, but he needs the help of others if it catches fire. He can keep his car running, but he needs the help of others to pave and maintain the roads. And, whatever he does to look after himself, he will eventually need the help of others for his medical care. “I think the goal should be security,” he said of health care. “Not just financial security but mental security—knowing that, no matter how bad things get, this shouldn’t be what you worry about. We don’t worry about the Fire Department, or the police. We don’t worry about the roads we travel on. And it’s not, like, ‘Here’s the traffic lane for the ones who did well and saved money, and you poor people, you have to drive over here.’ ” He went on, “Somebody I know said to me, ‘If we give everybody health care, it’ll be abused.’ I told her that’s a risk we take. The roads are abused. A lot of things are abused. It’s part of the deal.” He told me about a friend who’d undergone an emergency appendectomy. “She panicked when she woke up in the hospital realizing it would cost her a fortune,” he said. “Think about that. A lot of people will take a crappy job just to get the health benefits rather than start an entrepreneurial idea. If we’re talking about tax breaks for rich people to create jobs and entrepreneurialism, why not health care to allow regular people to do the same thing?” As he saw it, government existed to provide basic services like trash pickup, a sewer system, roadways, police and fire protection, schools, and health care. Do people have a right to trash pickup? It seemed odd to say so, and largely irrelevant. The key point was that these necessities can be provided only through collective effort and shared costs. When people get very different deals on these things, the pact breaks down. And that’s what has happened with American health care. The reason goes back to a seemingly innocuous decision made during the Second World War, when a huge part of the workforce was sent off to fight. To keep labor costs from skyrocketing, the Roosevelt Administration imposed a wage freeze. Employers and unions wanted some flexibility, in order to attract desired employees, so the Administration permitted increases in health-insurance benefits, and made them tax-exempt. It didn’t seem a big thing. But, ever since, we’ve been trying to figure out how to cover the vast portion of the country that doesn’t have employer-provided health insurance: low-wage workers, children, retirees, the unemployed, small-business owners, the self-employed, the disabled. We’ve had to stitch together different rules and systems for each of these categories, and the result is an unholy, expensive mess that leaves millions unprotected. No other country in the world has built its health-care system this way, and, in the era of the gig economy, it’s becoming only more problematic. Between 2005 and 2015, according to analysis by the economists Alan Krueger and Lawrence Katz, ninety-four per cent of net job growth has been in “alternative work arrangements”—freelancing, independent contracting, temping, and the like—which typically offer no health benefits. And we’ve all found ourselves battling over who deserves less and who deserves more. The Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild spent five years listening to Tea Party supporters in Louisiana, and in her masterly book “Strangers in Their Own Land” she identifies what she calls the deep story that they lived and felt. Visualize a long line of people snaking up a hill, she says. Just over the hill is the American Dream. You are somewhere in the middle of that line. But instead of moving forward you find that you are falling back. Ahead of you, people are cutting in line. You see immigrants and shirkers among them. It’s not hard to imagine how infuriating this could be to some, how it could fuel an America First ideal, aiming to give pride of place to “real” Americans and demoting those who would undermine that identity—foreigners, Muslims, Black Lives Matter supporters, feminists, “snowflakes.” Our political debates seem to focus on what the rules should be for our place in line. Should the most highly educated get to move up to the front? The most talented? Does seniority matter? What about people whose ancestors were cheated and mistreated? The mistake is accepting the line, and its dismal conception of life as a zero-sum proposition. It gives up on the more encompassing possibilities of shared belonging, mutual loyalty, and collective gains. America’s founders believed these possibilities to be fundamental. They held life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to be “unalienable rights” possessed equally by all members of their new nation. The terms of membership have had to be rewritten a few times since, sometimes in blood. But the aspiration has endured, even as what we need to fulfill it has changed. When the new country embarked on its experiment in democracy, health care was too primitive to matter to life or liberty. The average citizen was a hardscrabble rural farmer who lived just forty years. People mainly needed government to insure physical security and the rule of law. Knowledge and technology, however, expanded the prospects of life and liberty, and, accordingly, the requirements of government. During the next two centuries, we relied on government to establish a system of compulsory public education, infrastructure for everything from running water to the electric grid, and old-age pensions, along with tax systems to pay for it all. As in other countries, these programs were designed to be universal. For the most part, we didn’t divide families between those who qualified and those who didn’t, between participants and patrons. This inclusiveness is likely a major reason that these policies have garnered such enduring support. Health care has been the cavernous exception. Medical discoveries have enabled the average American to live eighty years or longer, and with a higher quality of life than ever before. Achieving this requires access not only to emergency care but also, crucially, to routine care and medicines, which is how we stave off and manage the series of chronic health issues that accumulate with long life. We get high blood pressure and hepatitis, diabetes and depression, cholesterol problems and colon cancer. Those who can’t afford the requisite care get sicker and die sooner. Yet, in a country where pretty much everyone has trash pickup and K-12 schooling for the kids, we’ve been reluctant to address our Second World War mistake and establish a basic system of health-care coverage that’s open to all. Some even argue that such a system is un-American, stepping beyond the powers the Founders envisioned for our government. In fact, in a largely forgotten episode in American history, Thomas Jefferson found himself confronting this very matter, shortly after his Inauguration as our third President, in 1801. Edward Jenner, in England, had recently developed a smallpox vaccine—a momentous medical breakthrough. Investigating the lore that milkmaids never got smallpox, he discovered that material from scabs produced by cowpox, a similar condition that afflicts cattle, induced a mild illness in people that left them immune to smallpox. Smallpox epidemics came with a mortality rate of thirty per cent or higher, and wiped out upward of five per cent of the population of cities like Boston and New York. Jefferson read Jenner’s report and arranged for the vaccination of two hundred relatives, neighbors, and slaves at Monticello. The President soon became vaccination’s preëminent American champion. But supplies were difficult to produce, and the market price was beyond the means of most families. Jefferson, along with his successor, James Madison, believed in a limited role for the federal government. They did not take expanding its power and its commitments lightly. By the time Jefferson finished his two terms as President, however, city and state governments had almost entirely failed to establish programs to provide vaccines for their citizens. Thousands of lives continued to be lost to smallpox outbreaks. Meanwhile, vaccination programs in England, France, and Denmark had dramatically curbed the disease and measurably raised the national life expectancy. So, at Jefferson’s prompting, and with Madison’s unhesitating support, Congress passed the Vaccine Act of 1813 with virtually no opposition. A National Vaccine Agent was appointed to maintain stocks of vaccine and supply it to any American who requested it. The government was soon providing free vaccine for tens of thousands of people each year. It was the country’s first health-care entitlement for the general population. And its passage wasn’t in the least controversial. Two centuries later, the Affordable Care Act was passed to serve a similar purpose: to provide all Americans with access to the life-preserving breakthroughs of our own generation. The law narrowed the yawning disparities in access to care, levied the taxes needed to pay for it, and measurably improved the health of tens of millions. But, to win passage, the A.C.A. postponed reckoning with our generations-old error of yoking health care to our jobs—an error that has made it disastrously difficult to discipline costs and insure quality, while severing care from our foundational agreement that, when it comes to the most basic needs and burdens of life and liberty, all lives have equal worth. The prospects and costs for health care in America still vary wildly, and incomprehensibly, according to your job, your state, your age, your income, your marital status, your gender, and your medical history, not to mention your ability to read fine print. Few want the system we have, but many fear losing what we’ve got. And we disagree profoundly about where we want to go. Do we want a single, nationwide payer of care (Medicare for all), each state to have its own payer of care (Medicaid for all), a nationwide marketplace where we all choose among a selection of health plans (Healthcare.gov for all), or personal accounts that we can use to pay directly for health care (Health Savings Accounts for all)? Any of these can work. Each has been made to work universally somewhere in the world. They all have their supporters and their opponents. We disagree about which benefits should be covered, how generous the financial protection should be, and how we should pay for it. We disagree, as well, about the trade-offs we will accept: for instance, between increasing simplicity and increasing choice; or between advancing innovation and reducing costs. What we agree on, broadly, is that the rules should apply to everyone. But we’ve yet to put this moral principle into practice. The challenge for any plan is to avoid the political perils of a big, overnight switch that could leave many people with higher costs and lower benefits. There are, however, many options for a gradual transition. Just this June, the Nevada legislature passed a bill that would have allowed residents to buy into the state’s Medicaid plan—if the governor hadn’t vetoed it. A similar bill to allow people to buy into Medicare was recently introduced in Congress. We need to push such options forward. Maintaining the link between health coverage and jobs is growing increasingly difficult, expensive, and self-defeating. But deciding to build on what’s currently working requires overcoming a well of mistrust about whether such investments will really serve a shared benefit. My friend Betsy Anderson, who taught eighth-grade English at Athens Middle School for fifteen years, told me something that made me see how deep that well is. When she first started out as a teacher, she said, her most satisfying experiences came from working with eager, talented kids who were hungry for her help in preparing them for a path to college and success. But she soon realized that her class, like America as a whole, would see fewer than half of its students earn a bachelor’s degree. Her job was therefore to try to help all of her students reach their potential—to contribute in their own way and to pursue happiness on their own terms. But, she said, by eighth grade profound divisions had already been cemented. The honors kids—the Hillary Clintons and Mitt Romneys of the school—sat at the top of the meritocratic heap, getting attention and encouragement. The kids with the greatest needs had special-education support. But, across America, the large mass of kids in the middle—the ones without money, book smarts, or athletic prowess—were outsiders in their own schools. Few others cared about what they felt or believed or experienced. They were the unspecial and unpromising, looked down upon by and almost completely separated from the college-bound crowd. Life was already understood to be a game of winners and losers; they were the designated losers, and they resented it. The most consistent message these students had received was that their lives were of less value than others’. Is it so surprising that some of them find satisfaction in a politics that says, essentially, Screw ’em all? Imet with Mark, a friend of Arnold’s, at the Union Street Diner, uptown near the campus of Ohio University, which makes Athens its home. The diner was a low-key place that stayed open twenty-four hours, with Formica tables and plastic cups, and a late-night clientele that was a mixture of townies and drunken students. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings. Mark ordered something healthier. (He asked me not to use his last name.) The son of a state highway patrolman, he had graduated from Athens High School five years ahead of me. Afterward, he worked as a cable installer, and got married at twenty-three. His wife worked at the Super Duper grocery store. Their pay was meagre and they were at the mercy of their bosses. So, the next year, they decided to buy a convenience store on the edge of town. Mark’s father-in-law was a builder, and he helped them secure a bank loan. They manned the register day and night, and figured out how to make a decent living. It was never a lot of money, but over time they built up the business, opening gas pumps, and hiring college students to work the counter part time. They were able to make a life of it. They adopted a child, a boy who was now a twenty-five-year-old graduate of the local university. Mark turned fifty-seven and remained a lifelong conservative. In general, he didn’t trust politicians. But he felt that Democrats in particular didn’t seem to recognize when they were pushing taxes and regulations too far. Health-care reform was a prime example. “It’s just the whole time they were coming up with this idea from copying some European model,” he said. “And I’m going, ‘Oh shit. This is not going to end up good for Mark.’ ” (Yes, he sometimes talks about himself in the third person.) For his health coverage, Mark trusted his insurance agent, whom he’d known for decades, more than he trusted the government. He’d always chosen the minimum necessary, a bare-bones, high-deductible plan. He and his wife weren’t able to conceive, so they didn’t have to buy maternity or contraceptive coverage. With Obamacare, though, he felt forced to pay extra to help others get benefits that he’d never had or needed. “I thought, Well, here we go, I guess I’m now kicking in for Bill Gates’s daughter’s pregnancy, too.” He wanted to keep government small and taxes low. He was opposed to Obamacare. Then, one morning a year ago, Mark’s back started to hurt. “It was a workday. I grabbed a Tylenol and I go, ‘No, this isn’t going to work, the pain’s too weird.’ ” It got worse, and when the pain began to affect his breathing he asked his wife to drive him to the emergency room. “They put me in a bed, and eight minutes later I’m out,” he recalled. “I’m dying.” Someone started chest compressions. A defibrillator was wheeled in, and his heart was given a series of shocks. When he woke up, he learned that he’d suffered cardiac arrest. “They said, ‘Well, you’re going to Riverside’ ”—a larger hospital, in Columbus, eighty miles away. “And I went back out again.” He’d had a second cardiac arrest, but doctors were able to shock him back to life once more. An electrocardiogram showed that he’d had a massive heart attack. If he was going to survive, he needed to get to Columbus immediately for emergency cardiac catheterization. The hospital got him a life-flight helicopter, but high winds made it unsafe to fly. So they took him by ground as fast as an ambulance could go. On the procedure table, a cardiologist found a blockage in the left main artery to his heart—a “widow-maker,” doctors call it—and stented it open. “The medicine is just crazy good,” Mark said. “By twelve-thirty, I was fixed.” After that, he needed five days in the hospital and several weeks at home to recover. Although he had to take a pile of drugs to reduce the chance of a recurrence, he got his strength back. He was able to resume work, hang out with his buddies, live his life. It was only after this experience that Mark realized what the A.C.A. had given him. Like twenty-seven per cent of adults under sixty-five, he now had a preëxisting condition that would have made him uninsurable on the individual market before health-care reform went into effect. But the A.C.A. requires insurers to accept everyone, regardless of health history, and to charge the healthy and the less healthy the same community rate. “This would have been a bad story for Mark,” he said. “Because the same time you’re being life-flighted is the same time you lose value to an employer. Your income is done.” He no longer opposed the requirement that people get insurance coverage. Fire insurance wouldn’t work if people paid for it only when their house was on fire, and health insurance wouldn’t work if people bought it only when they needed it. He was no longer interested in repealing protections for people like him. In this, he was like a lot of others. In 2013, before the implementation of the A.C.A., Americans were asked whether it was the government’s responsibility to make sure that everyone had health-care coverage, and fifty-six per cent said no. Four years after implementation, sixty per cent say yes. “But that doesn’t mean I have to sign on for full-blown socialism—cradle-to-grave everything,” Mark said. “It’s a balance.” Our willingness to trust in efforts like health reform can be built on experience, as happened with Mark, though we must recognize how tenuous that trust remains. Two sets of values are in tension. We want to reward work, ingenuity, self-reliance. And we want to protect the weak and the vulnerable—not least because, over time, we all become the weak and vulnerable, unable to get by without the help of others. Finding the balance is not a matter of achieving policy perfection; whatever program we devise, some people will put in more and some will take out more. Progress ultimately depends on whether we can build and sustain the belief that collective action genuinely results in collective benefit. No policy will be possible otherwise. Eight years after the passage of the Vaccine Act of 1813, a terrible mistake occurred. The Agent accidentally sent to North Carolina samples containing smallpox, instead of cowpox, causing an outbreak around the town of Tarboro that, in the next few months, claimed ten lives. The outrage over the “Tarboro Tragedy” spurred Congress to repeal the program, rather than to repair it, despite its considerable success. As a consequence, the United States probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives to a disease that several European programs had made vanishingly rare. It was eighty years before Congress again acted to insure safe, effective supplies of smallpox vaccine. When I told this story to people in Athens, everyone took the repeal to be a clear mistake. But some could understand how such things happen. One conservative thought that the people in North Carolina might wonder whether the reports of lives saved by the vaccine were fake news. They saw the lives lost from the supposed accident. They knew the victims’ names. As for the lives supposedly saved because of outbreaks that didn’t occur—if you don’t trust the government’s vaccines, you don’t necessarily trust the government’s statistics, either. These days, trust in our major professions—in politicians, journalists, business leaders—is at a low ebb. Members of the medical profession are an exception; they still command relatively high levels of trust. It does not seem a coincidence that medical centers are commonly the most culturally, politically, economically, and racially diverse institutions you will find in a community. These are places devoted to making sure that all lives have equal worth. But they also pride themselves on having some of the hardest-working, best-trained, and most innovative people in society. This isn’t to say that doctors, nurses, and others in health care fully live up to the values they profess. We can be condescending and heedless of the costs we impose on patients’ lives and bank accounts. We still often fail in our commitment to treating equally everyone who comes through our doors. But we’re embarrassed by this. We are expected to do better every day. The repeal of the Vaccine Act of 1813 represented a basic failure of government to deliver on its duty to protect the life and liberty of all. But the fact that public vaccination programs eventually became ubiquitous (even if it took generations) might tell us something about the ultimate direction of our history—the direction in which we are still slowly, fitfully creeping. On Mark’s last day in the hospital, the whole team came in to see him. He thanked them. “But I didn’t thank them for taking care of me,” he said. “I thanked them for when I was smoking, drinking, and eating chicken wings. They were all here working and studying, and I appreciated it.” “That’s what you thanked them for?” “Yeah,” he said. “Because if Mark wasn’t going to stop this, they were going to have to keep working hard. Something had to happen because Mark was clogging up.” And those people did keep working hard. They were there getting ready for Mark, regardless of who he would turn out to be—rich or poor, spendthrift or provident, wise or foolish. “I said, I am glad they do this every day, but I’m hoping to do it only once.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"A Roe v. Wade Anniversary, After a Year of Donald Trump",7961,"Donald Trump has broken many promises since becoming President, but one that he has faithfully upheld is the vow he made to Christian conservatives to “protect the unborn,” from nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, last January, to making it easier for states to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, an action that was announced by the Department of Health and Human Services on Friday. That same day, Trump became the first sitting President to deliver a live video address, from the Rose Garden, to the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion demonstration held around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. (Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressed the March for Life via prerecorded and live phone calls, respectively.) The future of that decision, which affirmed a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion and was handed down forty-five years ago today, has seldom seemed more in doubt. “We are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society,” Trump told the March for Life. His message was well received by Jeanne Mancini, the group’s president, who told Politico that the President has been a “great” ally. “It’s been a delight,” she said, “seeing how faithful he’s been.” Trump’s first year in office has been less of a delight for people like Chrisse France, the executive director of Preterm, an abortion clinic in Cleveland. After Trump’s election, protesters outside the clinic chanted, “We won! We won!” In the past year, a vandal has thrown bricks through the clinic’s windows and incidents of harassment of patients and staff members have sharply increased. One patient was followed home by a protester in a car. France attributed the air of heightened menace to the Administration’s attacks on reproductive rights. “Extremists are emboldened,” she said. This marks a shift. Since the nineteen-nineties, violence and harassment targeting abortion clinics have tended to peak under administrations that were sympathetic to abortion rights, when some radical right-to-life activists gravitated to more militant methods. The worst of the violence came during the two terms of President Bill Clinton, when seven abortion providers and clinic workers were murdered. When Republicans have held power, the threats have tended to taper off. But this pattern has not held under Trump. Though no deaths have occurred at clinics in the past year, Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation, a network of clinics and abortion providers, told me that her organization has reported to the Justice Department a rise in the number of threats during 2017, compared with the previous year. Protesters are not the only ones who have been emboldened. According to the Guttmacher Institute, nineteen states adopted sixty-three new abortion restrictions last year, the most since 2013. As Margaret Talbot wrote in The New Yorker last year, many of these laws, such as those that call for mandatory counselling sessions, in which patients are told about the mental-health consequences of having an abortion, have been framed as efforts to protect women from harm. There is no evidence, however, that women who have abortions suffer disproportionately from long-term mental-health problems, though evidence does suggest that being denied abortion care can have other adverse consequences. According to a paper published last week in The American Journal of Public Health, which compares a group of women who terminated their pregnancies with a group that was denied care for unwanted pregnancies, the consequences for those turned away included “a significant increase in household poverty; a reduction in full-time employment; an increase in public assistance that persists until women are timed out of these programs; an increased likelihood that women don’t have enough money to pay for food, housing and transportation.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump was criticized, including by many right-to-life advocates, for telling Chris Matthews of MSNBC that women who have abortions should be punished. The comment raised the spectre of a post-Roe America in which women could be sent to jail for seeking to terminate a pregnancy. But millions of women already face punishing emotional and material hardship in trying to terminate pregnancies under existing law. According to the Guttmacher Institute, fifty-eight per cent of American women of reproductive age currently live in states that are either “hostile or extremely hostile” to abortion rights, meaning that they are forced to navigate a tangle of onerous restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods and ultrasound requirements. Navigating these restrictions is especially challenging for women living below the poverty line, who make up fifty per cent of abortion patients today. Many of these women live in states where getting to a clinic requires a full day of travel, Carole Joffe, a sociologist of reproductive health at the University of California at San Francisco, says, a burden often compounded by a twenty-four-hour waiting period. (In Utah, the waiting period is seventy-two hours.) “Suppose you’re a single mother, working as a waitress,” Joffe told me. “That’s two days of lost wages, two days of child care, two days of finding a place to stay,” plus the cost of the procedure itself, if Medicaid will not pay for an abortion, which is the case in thirty-five states and the District of Columbia. As the throngs of demonstrators who took to the streets over the weekend in the second annual Women’s March attest, the Trump Administration’s effort to roll back reproductive rights has generated outrage. In several cities, marchers turned out in red cloaks and white bonnets, symbolically identifying with the women forced to bear children in Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.” (Though “The Handmaid’s Tale” is a work of dystopian fiction, in recent months the Trump Administration has tried to insist that undocumented minors held in federal custody who sought abortions should bring their pregnancies to term, even in a case of rape, on the grounds that the procedure was not in her “best interest.”) For some women, the Trump Administration’s assault on reproductive rights is especially galling because it is the product of a cynical alliance between the religious right and a twice-divorced President who has boasted of sexually assaulting women and who once described himself as “very pro-choice.” Unlike Vice-President Mike Pence, Trump does not draw on long-held tenets of faith in promoting anti-choice policies; he is rewarding the evangelical voters who helped get him to the White House. None of this stopped the President from saluting the Women’s March in a tweet that hailed his Administration’s accomplishments this weekend. The message from the marchers was less conciliatory. “Grab ’Em by the Midterms!” one sign proclaimed, underscoring the conviction that, when it comes to women’s rights, Trump’s “accomplishments” are seen by many as a calamitous threat.

Before having her tonsils removed, Jahi McMath, a thirteen-year-old African-American girl from Oakland, California, asked her doctor, Frederick Rosen, about his credentials. “How many times have you done this surgery?” Hundreds of times, Rosen said. “Did you get enough sleep last night?” He’d slept fine, he responded. Jahi’s mother, Nailah Winkfield, encouraged Jahi to keep asking questions. “It’s your body,” she said. “Feel free to ask that man whatever you want.” Jahi had begged not to get the surgery, but her mother promised that it would give her a better life. Jahi had sleep apnea, which left her increasingly fatigued and unable to focus at school. She snored so loudly that she was too embarrassed to go to slumber parties. Nailah had brought up four children on her own, and Jahi, her second, was her most cautious. When she saw news on television about wars in other countries, she would quietly ask, “Is it going to come here?” Her classmates made fun of her for being “chunky,” and she absorbed the insults without protest. A few times, Nailah went to the school and asked the teachers to control the other students. The operation, at Oakland’s Children’s Hospital, took four hours. When Jahi awoke, at around 7 p.m. on December 9, 2013, the nurses gave her a grape Popsicle to soothe her throat. About an hour later, Jahi began spitting up blood. The nurses told her not to worry and gave her a plastic basin to catch it in. A nurse wrote in her medical records that she encouraged Jahi to “relax and not cough if possible.” By nine that night, the bandages packing Jahi’s nose had become bloody, too. Nailah’s husband, Marvin, a truck driver, repeatedly demanded that a doctor help them. A nurse told him that only one family member was allowed in the room at a time. He agreed to leave. Nailah, who worked in contractor sales at Home Depot, said, “No one was listening to us, and I can’t prove it, but I really feel in my heart: if Jahi was a little white girl, I feel we would have gotten a little more help and attention.” Crying, she called her mother, Sandra Chatman, who had been a nurse for thirty years and who worked in a surgery clinic at Kaiser Permanente, in Oakland. Sandra, who is warm and calm and often wears a flower tucked into her hair, arrived at the hospital at ten o’clock. When she saw that Jahi had already filled a two-hundred-millilitre basin with blood, she told a nurse, “I don’t find this to be normal. Do you find this to be normal?” A nurse wrote in her notes that the physicians on duty were “notified several times over course of shift” that Jahi was bleeding. Another nurse wrote that the doctors were “aware of this post op bleeding” but said “there would be no immediate intervention from ENT or Surgery.” Rosen had left the hospital for the day. In his medical records, he had written that Jahi’s right carotid artery appeared abnormally close to the pharynx, a congenital condition that can potentially raise the risk of hemorrhaging. But the nurses responsible for her recovery seemed unaware of the condition and didn’t mention it in their notes. (Rosen’s attorney said that Rosen could not speak about Jahi; the hospital couldn’t comment, either, because of medical-privacy laws, but a lawyer said that the hospital is satisfied that Jahi’s nursing care was appropriate.) There were twenty-three beds in the intensive-care unit, spread over three rooms. A doctor was standing on the other side of Jahi’s room, and Sandra asked him, “Why aren’t you guys seeing about my granddaughter?” The doctor instructed the nurse on duty not to change Jahi’s hospital gown, so that he could assess how much blood she was losing, and to spray Afrin in her nose. Sandra, who teaches a workshop at Kaiser Permanente on the “four-habits model,” a method for improving empathy with patients, told me she was surprised that the doctor never introduced himself. “He was all frowned up with his arms crossed,” she said. “It was like he thought we were dirt.” At twelve-thirty in the morning, Sandra saw on Jahi’s monitor that her oxygen-saturation levels had fallen to seventy-nine per cent. She yelled to the medical staff, and several nurses and doctors ran toward Jahi and began working to intubate her. Sandra said that she heard one doctor say, “Oh, shit, her heart stopped.” It took two and a half hours to restore Jahi’s heartbeat and to stabilize her breathing. Sandra said that when she saw Rosen early the next morning he looked as if he’d been crying. Two days later, Jahi was declared brain-dead. With the help of a ventilator, she was breathing, but her pupils did not react to light, she did not have a gag reflex, and her eyes remained still when ice water was dripped in each ear. She was briefly disconnected from the ventilator, as a test, but her lungs filled with carbon dioxide. On an EEG test, no brain-wave activity could be seen. Like all states, California follows a version of the 1981 Uniform Determination of Death Act, which says that someone who has sustained the “irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead.” California law requires that hospitals permit “a reasonably brief period of accommodation” before disconnecting a ventilator—long enough to allow family to gather, but not so long that hospitals neglect the “needs of other patients and prospective patients in urgent need of care.” At a meeting with Rosen and other medical staff, the family asked for an apology. According to a social worker’s record of the meeting, Rosen “expressed sympathy.” The family wasn’t satisfied. “Step outside your job,” Marvin told him. “This was totally wrong!” Sandra said that Jahi had not “got the treatment she deserved.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Over the next few days, a social worker repeatedly urged Jahi’s family to make a plan for taking her off the ventilator. She also recommended that they consider donating her organs. “We were, like, ‘Nah,’ ” Marvin said. “ ‘First, tell us what happened to her.’ ” The family asked for Jahi’s medical records, but they weren’t allowed to see them while she was still in the hospital. Nailah didn’t understand how Jahi could be dead when her skin was still warm and soft and she occasionally moved her arms, ankles, and hips. The doctors said that the movement was only a spinal reflex, described in the medical literature as “a Lazarus sign.” An African-American critical-care doctor named Sharon Williams asked the hospital’s administration to give the family a little more time to grieve, expressing concern that taking Jahi off the ventilator right away “was not in the best interest of the family.” But, after a week, when their position still hadn’t changed, Williams asked to have a conversation with Sandra, “woman to woman.” Sandra said Williams told her that, if she waited too long to take Jahi off the ventilator, she wouldn’t look good for the funeral, adding, “You know how we are.” (Williams disagrees with Sandra’s description of the conversation.) “Who’s ‘we’?” Sandra remembers thinking. “We African-Americans? I felt so belittled. Yes, a lot of black children die in Oakland and people do have funerals for their children—but that don’t mean all of us are like that. Do you think we’re supposed to be used to our children dying, that this is just what black people normally go through?” She said, “At that point, I just lost all my trust.” Nailah’s younger brother, Omari Sealey, began sleeping in a chair next to Jahi’s hospital bed, to make sure no one could “kill her off.” He said, “I just felt her life wasn’t worth that much in their eyes. It was like they were trying to shoo us away.” A former baseball star at San Diego State University, he had a large following on social media, and on Instagram and Facebook he announced that the hospital was rushing them to unplug Jahi’s ventilator. “They are trying to feed us legal bull shit,” he wrote. “It’s not over until God say so.” In the comments section, one friend wrote, “This is universal chain of disrespect!!!! fck this healthcare system!!!” Another wrote, “They either wana see us dead or in jail they don’t wana see us alive.” A week after the surgery, Sealey called a personal-injury lawyer, Christopher Dolan, and told him, “They’re going to kill my niece.” Dolan agreed to take on the case pro bono, though he had no experience with legal issues involving the end of life. A self-described “cafeteria Catholic,” he acted on a vague feeling that a child with a beating heart was not entirely dead. He wrote a cease-and-desist order: if doctors unplugged Jahi’s ventilator, he said, they would violate her and her family’s civil rights. Sealey taped the note to Jahi’s bed and oxygen monitor. In a petition to the Alameda County Superior Court, Dolan requested that a physician unaffiliated with the hospital examine Jahi. He wrote that the hospital had a conflict of interest, because if its doctors were found guilty of malpractice they could “drastically reduce their liability by terminating Jahi’s life.” In cases of wrongful death, California places a cap of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on damages for pain and suffering. But there is no limit on the amount that can be recovered when a patient is still alive. In a separate motion, Dolan argued that the hospital was infringing on Nailah’s right to express her religion. He said that, as a Christian, she believed that her daughter’s soul inhabited her body as long as her heart beat. On December 19th, ten days after the surgery, David Durand, the hospital’s senior vice-president and chief medical officer, held a meeting with the family. They asked Durand to allow Jahi to remain on the ventilator until Christmas, suggesting that the swelling in her brain might subside. Durand said no. They also asked that she be given a feeding tube. Durand dismissed this request, too. The idea that the procedure would help her recover was an “absurd notion,” he later wrote, and would only add to the “illusion that she is not dead.” When they persisted, Durand asked, “What is it that you don’t understand?” According to Jahi’s mother, stepfather, grandmother, brother, and Dolan, who took notes, Durand pounded his fist on the table, saying, “She’s dead, dead, dead.” (Durand denies pounding his fist or repeating the word.) Three days before Christmas, a group of church leaders in Oakland gathered in front of the hospital and asked the district attorney to investigate what had happened to Jahi. “Is not Jahi worthy of the highest amount of medical treatment?” Brian K. Woodson, Sr., the pastor of Bay Area Christian Connection, said at a press conference. The next day, Evelio Grillo, a judge for the Alameda County Superior Court, appointed an independent expert, Paul Fisher, the chief of child neurology at Stanford University’s children’s hospital, to examine Jahi. During the hearing, two hundred people marched in front of the hospital, holding signs that said, “Justice for Jahi!” and “Doctors Can Be Wrong!” About a quarter of the protesters were Nailah’s friends and neighbors. She lived a short walk from her mother, who lived a few blocks from her own mother, who had moved to East Oakland from Opelousas, Louisiana, during the height of the civil-rights movement. Fisher repeated the standard brain-death exam and confirmed the hospital’s conclusion. He also performed a radionuclide cerebral-blood-flow study. “You see a complete white void, a whiteout in the part of the head where the brain is,” he told Judge Grillo the next day. “Normally it would be dark black.” Grillo ruled that the hospital could unplug Jahi’s ventilator in six days. The family set up a GoFundMe page to pay for Jahi to be airlifted to another hospital (“We acknowledge that the odds are stacked against us,” Nailah wrote), and strangers who learned about the case in the media contributed more than fifty thousand dollars. The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network—an organization founded by the parents and siblings of Terri Schiavo, who was in a persistent vegetative state for fifteen years and became a cause célèbre for the right-to-life movement—offered to use its contacts to find a facility. Nailah had never had an opinion on the right to life. On abortion, she was pro-choice. But, she said, “I just wanted to get her out of there.” Sandra said she sometimes wonders, “If the hospital had been more compassionate, would we have fought so much?” Nailah asked Children’s Hospital to perform a tracheotomy, a surgery that enables ventilator air to be pumped directly into the windpipe—a safer way for Jahi to breathe when transported to a new hospital. The hospital’s medical-ethics committee unanimously concluded that the intervention was inappropriate. “No conceivable goal of medicine—preserving life, curing disease, restoring function, alleviating suffering—can be achieved by continuing to ventilate and artificially support a deceased patient,” they wrote. They said that the doctors and nurses caring for Jahi were experiencing “tremendous moral distress,” and that accommodating the family’s requests would raise “significant concerns of justice and fairness.” Just before the court’s protective order was set to expire, Judge Grillo extended it by eight days. Not long afterward, Dolan and the lawyers for the hospital reached an agreement: the hospital would release Jahi to the Alameda County coroner, who would declare her dead. Then the family would become “wholly and exclusively responsible” for her. On January 3, 2014, the coroner issued Jahi’s death certificate. For cause of death, he wrote, “Pending investigation.” Two days later, two nurses from an air-evacuation service slipped into Jahi’s hospital room. A doctor from Children’s Hospital detached her from the ventilator, and the two nurses connected her to a portable one and put her on a gurney. They took her to an unmarked ambulance at the hospital’s back entrance. The San Francisco 49ers were playing the Green Bay Packers that day, and Dolan hoped the game would distract a crowd of journalists who had gathered in front. Dolan didn’t tell anyone where Jahi was going—not even her family—because he was afraid that the hospital would find out and somehow thwart the plan. Nailah was the only family member permitted on the plane, which was paid for with money received from GoFundMe. Nailah was terrified of the noise her daughter’s portable respirator was making, which seemed as loud as the jet’s engine. It wasn’t until they landed that she learned they were in New Jersey, one of only two states—New York is the other—where families can reject the concept of brain death if it violates their religious beliefs. The laws in both states were written to accommodate Orthodox Jews, some of whom believe, citing the Talmud, that the presence of breath signifies life. Jahi was admitted to St. Peter’s University Hospital, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which is run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen. Nailah said, “I had no plan, no place to live, no nothing.” She had packed one suitcase. “When it comes to my kid, I’m an animal,” she told me. “It wasn’t until later on that I was, like, What did I do?” Children’s Hospital hired Sam Singer, an expert in crisis communications and reputation management, to deal with the media that were covering the case. “The general perception inside the hospital was that they were under siege,” Singer told me. “They were not used to engaging in a gutter fight.” Two days after Jahi’s departure, Singer (whom the San Francisco Chronicle calls the city’s “top gun for hire”) told a local paper, “I’ve never seen such reckless disregard for the truth.” At a press conference in front of the hospital, he said that Dolan had “created a hoax. A very sad hoax. That Jahi McMath is in some way alive. She’s not. She’s deceased by every law in the state of California. And by every spiritual belief system imaginable.” Bioethicists also disparaged the family’s decision. In an op-ed in Newsday, Arthur Caplan, the founding director of N.Y.U.’s Division of Medical Ethics and perhaps the best-known bioethicist in the country, wrote, “Keeping her on a ventilator amounts to desecration of a body.” He told CNN, “There isn’t any likelihood that she’s gonna survive very long.” In an interview with USA Today, he said, “You can’t really feed a corpse” and “She is going to start to decompose.” Laurence McCullough, a professor of medical ethics at Cornell, criticized any hospital that would admit Jahi. “What could they be thinking?” he said to USA Today. “There is a word for this: crazy.” Robert Truog, the director of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, said that he was troubled by the tone of the media coverage. “I think that the bioethics community felt this need to support the traditional understanding of brain death, to the point that they were really treating the family with disdain, and I felt terrible about that,” he told me. Truog thought that the social context of the family’s decision had been ignored. African-Americans are twice as likely as whites to ask that their lives be prolonged as much as possible, even in cases of irreversible coma—a preference that likely stems from fears of neglect. A large body of research has shown that black patients are less likely to get appropriate medications and surgeries than white ones are, regardless of their insurance or education level, and more likely to receive undesirable medical interventions, like amputations. Truog said, “When a doctor is saying your loved one is dead, and your loved one doesn’t look dead, I understand that it might feel that, once again, you are not getting the right care because of the color of your skin.” Until the nineteen-sixties, cardio-respiratory failure was the only way to die. The notion that death could be diagnosed in the brain didn’t emerge until after the advent of the modern ventilator, allowing what was known at the time as “oxygen treatment”: as long as blood carrying oxygen reached the heart, it could continue to beat. In 1967, Henry Beecher, a renowned bioethicist at Harvard Medical School, wrote to a colleague, “It would be most desirable for a group at Harvard University to come to some subtle conclusion as to a new definition of death.” Permanently comatose patients, maintained by mechanical ventilators, were “increasing in numbers over the land and there are a number of problems which should be faced up to.” Beecher created a committee comprising men who already knew one another: ten doctors, one lawyer, one historian, and one theologian. In less than six months, they completed a report, which they published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The only citation in the article was from a speech by the Pope. They proposed that the irreversible destruction of the brain should be defined as death, giving two reasons: to relieve the burden on families and hospitals, which were providing futile care to patients who would never recover, and to address the fact that “obsolete criteria for the definition of death can lead to controversy in obtaining organs for transplantation,” a field that had developed rapidly; in the previous five years, doctors had performed the world’s first transplant of a pancreas, a liver, a lung, and a heart. In an earlier draft, the second reason was stated more directly: “There is great need for the tissues and organs of the hopelessly comatose in order to restore to health those who are still salvageable.” (The sentence was revised after Harvard’s medical dean wrote that “the connotation of this statement is unfortunate.”) In the next twelve years, twenty-seven states rewrote their definitions of death to conform to the Harvard committee’s conclusions. Thousands of lives were prolonged or saved every year because patients declared brain-dead—a form of death eventually adopted by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and most of Europe—were now eligible to donate their organs. The philosopher Peter Singer described it as “a concept so desirable in its consequences that it is unthinkable to give up, and so shaky on its foundations that it can scarcely be supported.” The new death was “an ethical choice masquerading as a medical fact,” he wrote. Legal ambiguities remained—people considered alive in one region of the country could be declared dead in another—and, in 1981, the President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems proposed a uniform definition and theory of death. Its report, which was endorsed by the American Medical Association, stated that death is the moment when the body stops operating as an “integrated whole.” Even if life continues in individual organs and cells, the person is no longer alive, because the functioning organs are merely a collection of artificially maintained subsystems that will inevitably disintegrate. “The heart usually stops beating within two to ten days,” the report said. The commission’s staff philosopher, Daniel Wikler, a professor at Harvard and the first staff ethicist for the World Health Organization, told me that he didn’t think the commission’s theory of death was supported by the scientific facts it cited. “I thought it was demonstrably untrue, but so what?” he said. “I didn’t see a downside at the time.” Wikler told the commission that it would be more logical to say that death occurred when the cerebrum—the center for consciousness, thoughts, and feelings, the properties essential to having a personal identity—was destroyed. His formulation would have rendered a much broader population of patients, including those who could breathe on their own, dead. Despite Wikler’s reservations, he drafted the third chapter of the report, “Understanding the ‘Meaning’ of Death.” “I was put in a tight spot, and I fudged,” he told me. “I knew that there was an air of bad faith about it. I made it seem like there are a lot of profound unknowns and went in the direction of fuzziness, so that no one could say, ‘Hey, your philosopher says this is nonsense.’ That’s what I thought, but you’d never know from what I wrote.” When Jahi arrived in New Jersey, she hadn’t been fed for more than three weeks, and her organs were failing. The chief of pediatric critical care at St. Peter’s wrote in her records that there was “no hope of brain recovery.” Nailah said, “I didn’t have a clue. I had really thought that I would get her a feeding tube and a tracheotomy, and she would just get up, and we would be good.” In the hospital cafeteria, she saw other families whispering about her. A surgeon at St. Peter’s gave Jahi a tracheal tube and a feeding tube, which provided nutrition and vitamins. Nailah, who spent all her waking hours in the hospital, became friendly with some of the nurses, who told her that the surgeon who performed the tracheotomy had been ostracized by his colleagues. “They were, like, ‘You operated on that dead girl?’ ” she said. (The hospital did not return calls to speak about the case; in Jahi’s records, a physician wrote that the St. Peter’s administration had agreed to treat her “without medical personnel’s acceptance.”) Nailah and Marvin slept at a house that the hospital owned, until, after three months, they were told they needed to move on, to make room for other families. They took a cab to a Motel 6. For the next three months, they stayed at whatever motel had the best weekly rate. Nailah’s youngest child, Jordyn, moved in with her aunt, and her son, Jose, moved in with his father, in Oakland. (Nailah’s oldest child was an adult, living on her own.) The human-resources department at Home Depot kept calling Nailah to ask when she’d return. “I don’t know,” she told them. They finally stopped calling. Nailah, who owned her house in Oakland, told me, “I felt like I was exiled out of my state.” By March, Jahi’s condition had begun to stabilize. Her skin became more elastic, her limbs and face became less swollen, and her blood pressure steadied. In their progress notes, her doctors simply wrote, “Status quo.” No rehabilitation facilities would accept her as a patient, so she remained in the hospital’s intensive-care unit, her treatment covered by Medicaid. Nailah said that the cost of care was roughly a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a week. According to New Jersey’s 1991 statute on death, insurance providers can’t deny coverage because of “personal religious beliefs regarding the application of neurological criteria for declaring death.” Alan Weisbard, the executive director of the bioethics commission that drafted the law, told me, “I thought our position should be one of humility, rather than certainty.” Weisbard had previously served as the assistant legal director for the President’s Commission on death and, like Wikler, he felt uneasy about the result. He said, “I think that the people who have done the deep and conceptual thinking about brain death are people with high I.Q.s, who tremendously value their cognitive abilities—people who believe that the ability to think, to plan, and to act in the world are what make for meaningful lives. But there is a different tradition that looks much more to the body.” The notion of brain death has been rejected by some Native Americans, Muslims, and evangelical Protestants, in addition to Orthodox Jews. The concept is also treated with skepticism in Japan, owing in part to distrust of medical authority. Japan’s first heart transplant, in 1968, became a national scandal—it was unclear that the donor was beyond recovery, or that the recipient (who died shortly after the transplant) needed a new heart—and, afterward, the country never adopted a comprehensive law equating brain death with the death of a human being. Weisbard, a religious Jew, said that he didn’t think “minority communities should be forced into a definition of death that violates their belief structures and practices and their primary senses.” Nailah kept thinking about a conversation that she’d had with her children a year before. She’d been teasing them, saying, “I’m going to run your business for the rest of your lives.” When her son bragged that he’d outlive her, she joked, “Well, I’m going to get put on a ventilator.” Jahi had never heard the word and asked what it meant. “It’s a machine that keeps you alive,” Nailah explained. She told me, “I’ll never forget: the rest of the kids laughed, and Jahi said, ‘Well, if something ever happens to me, make sure you keep me on one of those.’ ” At St. Peter’s Hospital, a music therapist visited the intensive-care unit every few days. She stood next to Jahi’s bed and played lullabies and soothing melodies on a harp. Nailah observed that Jahi’s heart rate, which tended to be high, would lower when the harpist played. She wondered if her daughter found the songs calming. Nailah said, “I knew that Jahi was in there.” She began requesting that she move different parts of her body. In one test, which Nailah recorded on her cell phone, she stands at the side of Jahi’s hospital bed without touching it. Jahi’s eyes are closed, and the upper half of her bed is raised at a forty-five-degree angle. Her hands are placed on rolled cloths, to keep them from contracting into fists. “Move your hand,” Nailah says. Two seconds later, Jahi cocks her right wrist. “Very good!” Nailah says. “Can you move your hand again? Move your hand so we can see it. Move it hard.” Nine seconds later, Jahi flexes her forearm, turns her wrist, drops the cloth, and lifts her fingers. Her face is expressionless and still. In another video, Nailah says, “Kick your foot.” Jahi’s purple blanket has been folded back, revealing her bare feet and ankles. After fifteen seconds, she wiggles her toes. “Try your hardest,” Nailah says. “I see you moved your toes, but you have to kick your foot.” Twenty-two seconds later, Jahi flicks her right foot upward. “Oh, I’m so proud of you,” Nailah says, leaning over the bed and kissing her cheek. Seven months after moving to New Jersey, Jahi began menstruating. Sandra was visiting, and she asked the doctor on call to give Jahi a heating pad and Motrin—all the women in her family had severe cramps—and to note in Jahi’s medical records that she had got her period for the first time. The doctor told Sandra and Nailah that he couldn’t say for sure what was causing the blood flow. Nailah told him, “Blood is coming out of a teen-age girl’s vagina, and nowhere else, for five days—what do you think it is? Is there another diagnosis?” Sandra said that they both became so agitated that the doctor finally told them, “Why don’t you two girls go for a walk in the park outside.” In late August, 2014, Jahi was released from St. Peter’s. Her discharge diagnosis was brain death. She moved into a two-bedroom apartment that Nailah and Marvin had rented in a colorless condominium complex near New Brunswick. They slept on an air mattress on the floor, and Jordyn, who had just moved to New Jersey, to begin first grade, slept on the couch. Jahi had the brightest room, with a large window overlooking the parking lot. Nurses, paid for by Medicaid, provided twenty-four-hour care, in eight-hour shifts. Every four hours, Nailah helped them turn her daughter’s body. One of Jahi’s most loyal nurses taped a note to the wall of her bedroom: “During your shift, interact with her,” she had written. “She does hear you! Speak clearly, softly, slowly.” She added, “No one knows if she understands, but just your comforting voice or touch should help.” Not long after the family moved in, two detectives and a patrol officer showed up at the apartment. The Franklin Township Police Detective Bureau had received an anonymous tip that there was a dead body in the house. Nailah led the detectives into Jahi’s room and showed them her ventilator. The cops concluded that there was no criminal activity and left, but the nurse on duty was rattled, and she quit. Nailah had for months been flooded by e-mails and Facebook messages accusing her of child abuse or of exploiting her daughter for money. Strangers started a petition on Change.org to “stop NJ from paying for corpse care out of taxpayers money”; the petition said that Nailah had bought a Michael Kors purse and expensive wine, an accusation based on pictures on Instagram. Nailah’s lawyer, Dolan, told me, “They think she’s just some black lady sucking down social resources.” Nailah read the Bible more than she ever had, and she tried to entertain the idea that God had chosen her to suffer this way because she was resilient enough to endure it. On her Facebook page, she described herself as “just a strong black woman who is not in the mood for anyone’s bullshit!” But she couldn’t accept the idea that divine logic was at work. “I really don’t feel like this was God’s plan for my kid’s life,” she said. A month after Jahi’s discharge, the International Brain Research Foundation, a neuroscience think tank that supports novel research, helped pay for Jahi to have MRI scans at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Calixto Machado, the president of the Cuban Society of Clinical Neurophysiology, flew to New Jersey to analyze the scans. Machado has published more than two hundred papers on disorders of consciousness and runs a symposium every four years that attracts the world’s leading scholars of brain death. He said, “Everybody was talking about Jahi—Jahi this, Jahi that—but nobody knew the neurological picture.” The fact that Jahi had begun menstruating—a process mediated by the hypothalamus, near the front of the brain—suggested to him that not all neurological functions had ceased. Dolan sat beside Machado in the hospital as he looked at two computer screens showing images of Jahi’s head and the top of her spine. In the rare cases in which brain-dead patients are sustained by a ventilator, neurologists have reported a phenomenon called “respirator brain”: the brain liquefies. Machado said that if Jahi’s original diagnosis was correct, and she’d had no cerebral blood flow for nine months, he expected that she’d have little tissue structure in her cranial cavity, just fluid and disorganized membranes. On the scans, Machado observed that Jahi’s brain stem was nearly destroyed. The nerve fibres that connect the brain’s right and left hemispheres were barely recognizable. But large areas of her cerebrum, which mediates consciousness, language, and voluntary movements, were structurally intact. Dolan shouted, “She’s got a brain!” Machado also performed a test that measures the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, a relationship that regulates states of arousal and rest. He used three experimental conditions, one of which he called “Mother talks to the patient.” Nailah stood next to her daughter without touching her. “Hey, Jahi, I’m here,” she told her. “I love you. Everyone is so proud of you.” Machado noted that Jahi’s heart rate changed in response to her mother’s voice. “This cannot be found in a brain-dead patient,” he wrote. Three days after the scans, Dolan submitted a report by Machado to the Alameda County Coroner’s Bureau and asked it to rescind Jahi’s death certificate, so that Nailah could return to California and have Jahi treated there. The coroner and the county’s public-health department rejected the request. “Any opportunity to overturn the Court’s holding that Jahi McMath is brain dead has long expired,” their lawyers wrote. D.Alan Shewmon, who had just retired as the chief of the neurology department at Olive View-U.C.L.A. Medical Center, read Machado’s report and wondered if Jahi had a condition, first proposed by the Brazilian neurologist C. G. Coimbra, called ischemic penumbra. Coimbra hypothesized that this brain state could lead to a misdiagnosis of brain death in patients whose cerebral blood flow was diminished enough that it couldn’t be detected by the standard tests. If blood was still flowing to parts of the brain, however slowly, then, in theory, some degree of recovery could be possible. Shewmon has given a diagnosis of brain death to roughly two hundred people. He is measured, formal, and precise. When I asked him what he thought of the media coverage stating that Jahi would die imminently, he paused and said, “I sit back and let it play out.” He laughed, harder than I would have expected, and said nothing more. Two months after Machado’s tests, Shewmon flew to New Jersey and visited Jahi at her apartment. He pulled a desk chair next to her bed and, with a notepad in his hand, watched her for six hours. Jahi did not respond to his instructions to move her limbs, a fact that Shewmon did not find particularly revealing. He had analyzed the videos that Nailah had recorded, and they suggested to him that Jahi was in a minimally conscious state, a condition in which patients are partly or intermittently aware of themselves and their environment. He wrote that her condition “creates a particular challenge to either disprove or verify, because the likelihood of Jahi being in a ‘responsive’ state during a random examination is small.” After Shewmon left, Nailah took more videos. She followed Shewmon’s instructions not to touch her daughter during the filming and to begin the video outside Jahi’s room. Shewmon eventually analyzed forty-nine videos containing a hundred and ninety-three commands and six hundred and sixty-eight movements. He wrote that the movements occur “sooner after command than would be expected on the basis of random occurrence,” and that “there is a very strong correspondence between the body part requested and the next body part that moves. This cannot be reasonably explained by chance.” He noted that the movements “bear no resemblance to any kind of reflex,” and that, in one video, Jahi seemed to display a complex level of linguistic comprehension. “Which finger is the eff-you finger?” Nailah asked her. “When you get mad at somebody, which finger you supposed to move?” Two seconds later, Jahi flexed her left middle finger. Then she bent her pinkie. “Not that one,” Nailah said. Four seconds later, Jahi moved her middle finger again. James Bernat, a neurologist at Dartmouth who helped develop the theory of brain death that formed the basis of the 1981 President’s Commission report, told me that Shewmon showed him some of the videos. “My thoughts about this are not fully formed,” he said, adding, “I’m always skeptical of videotapes, because of the videos of Terri Schiavo.” Her family had released video clips that they presented as proof of consciousness, but the videos had been edited, giving the impression that she was tracking people with her eyes, even though she was blind.* Bernat said, “I have a huge amount of respect for Alan, and if he says something, I am going to pay attention to it.” He called Shewmon “the most intellectually honest person I have ever met.” When Shewmon was a college sophomore, at Harvard, he listened to Chopin’s Trois Nouvelles Études No. 2, in his dorm room, and the music lifted him into such a state of ecstasy that he had an epiphany: he no longer thought it possible that all conscious experience, particularly one’s perception of beauty, could be a “mere electrophysiological epiphenomenon,” he said. The music seemed to transcend “the spatial limitations of matter.” An atheist, he converted to Catholicism and studied Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy. He went to medical school, in 1971, and then specialized in neurology, because he wanted to understand the relationship between the mind and the brain. For the next fifteen years, he believed in and defended the notion of brain death, but in the early nineties he began to feel increasingly troubled by the concept. When he engaged in what he called “Socratic conversations” with colleagues, he saw that few doctors could confidently articulate why the destruction of one organ was synonymous with death. Usually, they’d end up saying that these patients were still living biological organisms but had lost the capacities that made them human. He thought the formulation seemed too similar to the idea of “mental death,” which the Nazis embraced after the publication, in 1920, of a widely read medical and legal text called “Permission to Destroy Life Unworthy of Living.” In 1992, Shewmon was asked to consult on the case of a fourteen-year-old boy who, after falling off the hood of a moving car, had been declared brain-dead. The boy’s family was religious and insisted that he remain on a ventilator. His physicians, certain that his heart would soon fail, acceded to his parents’ request. He survived for sixty-three days and began puberty. “This case flew in the face of everything I had been taught regarding the universality and imminence of somatic demise in brain death,” Shewmon later wrote. “It forced me to rethink the whole thing.” Shewmon began researching similar cases, and found a hundred and seventy-five people, many of whom were children or teen-agers, who lived for months or years after they were legally dead. The longest survivor was a boy who had been declared dead after contracting meningitis, when he was four. His heart beat for twenty more years, during which time he grew proportionally and recovered from minor wounds and infections, even though he had no identifiable brain structure and the outside of his brain had calcified. In 1997, in a paper called “Recovery from ‘Brain Death’: A Neurologist’s Apologia,” Shewmon disavowed his earlier views. He acknowledged that “dissenters from the ‘brain death’ concept are typically dismissed condescendingly as simpletons, religious zealots or pro-life fanatics,” and announced that he was joining their ranks. Shewmon’s research on what he calls “chronic survival” after brain death helped prompt a new President’s council on bioethics, in 2008, to revisit the definition of death. The council’s report referred to Shewmon’s research thirty-eight times. Although it ultimately reaffirmed the validity of brain death, it abandoned the biological and philosophical justification presented by the 1981 President’s Commission—that a functioning brain was necessary for the body to operate as an “integrated whole.” Instead, the report said that the destruction of the brain was equivalent to death because it meant that a human being was no longer able to “engage in commerce with the surrounding world,” which is “what an organism ‘does’ and what distinguishes every organism from nonliving things.” In a personal note appended to the end of the report, the chairman of the council, Edmund Pellegrino, expressed regret regarding the lack of empirical precision. He wrote that attempts to articulate the boundaries of death “end in some form of circular reasoning—defining death in terms of life and life in terms of death without a true ‘definition’ of one or the other.” In 2015, after Nailah filed her taxes, her accountant called to tell her that her submission had been rejected by the I.R.S. One of the “dependents” she’d listed was deceased. “I was, like, Oh, God, now I have to tell this guy what is going on—that she’s alive on a state level and dead on the federal level,” she said. She decided not to fight the I.R.S.; she was sure that she’d lose. “It’s not even about money,” she told me. “It’s the principle: I really have a human being that I get up and see about every day.” Nailah sold her house in Oakland to pay her rent in New Jersey. She almost never left the apartment. Consumed by guilt for having urged Jahi to have her tonsils removed, she was given a diagnosis of depression. “I used to watch the antidepressant commercials, where people would stare out the window and say they couldn’t go outside, and I’d think, That is ridiculous,” she told me. “Who can’t go outside? Who can’t get off the bed? Where I’m from, you have survival skills—you learn to adapt. If you’re poor, if anything goes wrong, you can still make it. But this is one situation that I cannot adapt to.” In the spring of 2015, Nailah filed a malpractice lawsuit against Oakland Children’s Hospital, seeking damages for Jahi’s pain, suffering, and medical expenses. The hospital argued that deceased bodies do not have legal standing to sue. “Plaintiffs are preserving Jahi’s body from its natural post-mortem course,” the hospital’s lawyers wrote. “It would be against public policy to hold health professionals liable for the costs of the futile medical interventions performed on a dead person.” Dolan submitted video recordings of Jahi and declarations from Machado, three New Jersey doctors who had examined her, and Shewmon, who concluded that Jahi had fulfilled the requirements of brain death at the time of her diagnosis but no longer did. He wrote, “With the passage of time, her brain has recovered the ability to generate electrical activity, in parallel with its recovery of ability to respond to commands.” He described her as “an extremely disabled but very much alive teenage girl.” The hospital hired its own medical experts. Thomas Nakagawa, who wrote the 2011 guidelines for pediatric brain death, said that the only accepted criteria for brain death were those stipulated by the guidelines. MRI scans, the heart-rate analysis, the videos of movement, and the evidence of menstruation were not relevant to the criteria. Sanford Schneider, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine, referred to Jahi as a “corpse,” and told the court that she “cannot respond to verbal commands, because she has no cerebral mechanism to hear sound,” a conclusion based on a test that measured Jahi’s brain-wave activity in response to different noises. Schneider wrote, “There is absolutely no medical possibility that J McMath has recovered, or will someday recover, from death.” Last summer, a judge on the Alameda County Superior Court rejected the hospital’s argument that the brain-death exam from 2013 “must be accorded finality for any and all other purposes.” He ruled that “a triable issue of fact exists as to whether Jahi currently satisfies the statutory definition of ‘dead.’ ” In a trial expected to last a month, a jury will decide if Jahi is alive. Jahi’s case has sparked what Thaddeus Pope, a bioethicist at Mitchell Hamline University School of Law, calls the “Jahi McMath shadow effect”: a rise in the number of families, many of them ethnic or racial minorities, going to court to prevent hospitals from unplugging their loved ones from ventilators. In Toronto, the family of Taquisha McKitty, a young black mother declared dead after a drug overdose, argued that she couldn’t have died, because she still had a menstrual cycle. At a court hearing this fall, her doctor said that he was aware of vaginal bleeding but “nobody knows if that was menstrual.” A similar debate unfolded in 2015, when an Ethiopian college student, Aden Hailu, was declared brain-dead at a hospital in Nevada after exploratory surgery for stomach pain. A district court rejected her father’s request to keep her on a ventilator, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision, ruling that expert testimony was needed to determine whether the standard brain-death tests “adequately measure all functions of the entire brain.” (The hearing never happened, because Hailu’s heart stopped beating.) Pope told me that “every extra hour of nursing time that goes into one of these dead patients is an hour of nursing time that didn’t go to somebody else.” He also worries that these disputes, which often get media attention, will cause fewer people to register as organ donors, a practice whose social acceptability depends on the idea that patients are dead before their vital organs are removed. When I expressed anxiety that my article could perpetuate the problem, he remarked that it could “do a small amount of harm.” Then he reconsidered and said, “The cat’s already out of the bag.” Nailah’s lawyer, Dolan, a registered organ donor, told me that he struggles with the practical consequences of advocating for Jahi. “There’s a part of me that’s, like, Shit, we may screw up organ donation,” he said. When families in similar situations call him, he tells Nailah’s story to warn against following her path. “This is like Job,” he said. Truog, the director of the Center of Bioethics at Harvard, said that once, when he gave an academic talk on brain death, he described it as a catastrophic brain injury, rather than death. A transplant physician stood up and told him, “You should be ashamed of yourself. What you are doing is immoral: to put doubts in the minds of people about a practice that is saving countless lives.” Truog told me, “I’ve thought long and hard about that. In order to support public trust in the scientific enterprise, I guess I feel that the medical profession is always going to be better off, in the long run, if we speak honestly and truthfully about what we know.” He continued, “I don’t think there’s anything morally wrong with the fact that we take organs from these people, even though there is no scientific reason for believing them to be dead. I believe it is a morally virtuous thing to do and we ought to facilitate it. We are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.” Although Jahi has come to represent a different way of defining life, her family is not sure that they would keep her on a ventilator if she still fulfilled the expectations for brain death. Sandra said that, before Jahi was given the MRI scans at Rutgers, she told herself, “If her brain is jelly, we are going to have to accept that. I don’t think people should live on that way. If they’re gone, they’re gone.” Jahi’s family believes that she is capable of a fuller range of thought than she is able to express, an idea that Shewmon has also considered. “Given the evidence of intermittent responsiveness,” he wrote in a declaration to the court, “we should be all the more willing to remain agnostic regarding her inner state of mind during periods of unresponsivity, rather than automatically equate it with unconsciousness.” Recent advances in neuroimaging have led some clinicians to consider the possibility that a significant portion of patients thought to be in a vegetative state—those who demonstrate no overt awareness of their environment and do not make purposeful movements—have been misdiagnosed; they may be periodically conscious and capable of some degree of communication. Nailah said that nearly every day she asks Jahi, “Are you O.K. with what I’m doing? Do you want to live? Are you suffering?” She said, “I know that things change—people change. If Jahi has given up and doesn’t want to be here anymore, I’m just going to go with what she wants.” She said that Jahi answers her questions by either squeezing her hand or pressing her own index finger toward her thumb, a signal for “yes” that Nailah taught her. “When I see that,” she said, “I think, Who am I to not want to live? Because many days I do want to die. But then I see her every day, trying her best.” Last December, I visited Nailah at her apartment, and she said that she had begun to feel more hopeful. She felt more confident that the courts would allow her to bring Jahi home to Oakland, although the trial has not yet been scheduled. Recently, she had asked Jahi how long she thought it would take. Six months? she asked. A year? A year and a half? Jahi squeezed her hand after the third question. Nailah took it as her answer. “I am planning this big-ass welcome-home party in my head,” Nailah told me. “I know my city really, really loves us.” “Hi, girl, are you sleeping or awake?” Nailah said to Jahi as we walked into her room. Jahi wore pink pajamas, and her face was clear and smooth but bloated, a side effect of a steroid she takes to raise her blood pressure. Her eyes were closed. “Are you sleeping? I want to know,” Nailah said. She picked up Jahi’s hand and held it with both of her palms. Jahi’s other hand was draped over the belly of a baby doll. Her hair was in thin braids that Nailah worried were getting thinner. Stacey, a nurse who had been caring for Jahi for the past year, stood by her feet. Stacey had spent the morning reading her a Sherlock Holmes story. Nailah spoke about how much she had come to appreciate her own mother, who called Jahi three times a day, singing to her, reading prayers, relaying family gossip, and updating her on the Golden State Warriors. Stacey interrupted: “She’s moving her hand on the baby.” Jahi’s index and middle finger had shifted about half an inch, moving from the doll’s belly to its chest. “Good job,” Stacey said. “Good job, Jahi!” “Can you move your pointer finger on the baby?” Nailah asked. Jahi’s fingernails, which Nailah had painted pink, remained still. “That’s your baby,” Nailah said, referring to the doll. “That’s my grandbaby,” she said, laughing. Jahi’s thumb trembled. “Not your thumb, but your pointer finger,” Nailah said. “I know you can do it.” After a few seconds, Jahi’s middle finger flickered. She raised it slightly and then dropped it. “There you go,” Nailah said. “Thank you.” Daniel Wikler, the Harvard philosopher, told me that he guessed Jahi’s family might be suffering from “folie à famille,” a rare condition in which a delusion is shared by all members of a family. It struck me as a coherent response to the death of a child: who wouldn’t find comfort in the fantasy that the child’s will had been preserved? It seemed so intuitive that I worried I could also be investing undue meaning in gestures nearly too subtle to discern. Given the weight of the evidence, though, it seemed unlikely. Jahi’s doctors and nurses were all converts, too. On Nailah’s cell-phone recordings, which document the past four years of her daughter’s life, several different nurses can be heard congratulating Jahi for gathering the strength and commitment to move a foot or a finger. Jahi’s little sister, Jordyn, was similarly devoted. A wiry girl wearing faded skinny jeans and Day-Glo high-top sneakers, she walked into her sister’s room as soon as the school bus dropped her off. In Oakland, she and Jahi had shared a bedroom, and now she liked to lie in bed with her sister; sometimes she’d put lip gloss on her or rub lotion on her legs. Jordyn was unruly in school, and Sandra worried that her misbehavior was an expression of alienation at home. Once, when Jordyn seemed jealous of all the love directed toward her sister, Nailah said, “Do you think your sister would do this for you?” Jordyn said yes. “Well, that’s why we’re doing everything for her,” Nailah told her. Jordyn has learned that if she wants to have a conversation in her sister’s room she needs to stand on the same side of the bed as her mother. “Jahi doesn’t like when two people talk over her,” Nailah said. “Her heart rate shoots up.” It makes Jahi nervous and upset, Nailah said, to be treated as if she didn’t exist. “She listens to everybody’s conversations—she has no choice,” she said. “I bet she has some secrets she can tell us.” She smoothed back Jahi’s hair. “You know how sometimes, when you’re just sitting still, thinking, you can take yourself somewhere else? I always say, ‘Jahi, one day, I want to know everything you know and everywhere that you’ve been.’ ” ♦ *Bobby Schindler, Terri Schiavo’s brother, contends that, although an autopsy confirmed that she was blind at the time of her death, it is unclear if she was blind when the video was recorded. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jahi’s mother has a do-not-resuscitate order for her. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Republican Tax Scam Isn’t Quite a Done Deal,8533,"With Senate Republicans still celebrating their success in voting through a highly controversial tax bill, their colleagues in the House of Representatives have already begun the process of reconciling it with the bill they passed last month. On Monday, House Republicans voted to send the two bills to a joint House-Senate conference committee that will be tasked with drafting final legislation. The Republicans also named their five appointees to the committee: Representative Kevin Brady, of Texas, the head of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, will lead the process. Both the House and the Senate will have to vote again on the final bill, but Republican leaders are expressing confidence that they’ll be able to get legislation to the President by Christmas. “This is the moment and the opportunity that we—and so many Americans—have worked for and waited for,” Brady said in a statement. “Now is the time to seize it. And working together—working truly together—I’m confident we will.” Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader, said, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” “We can work and have this done this year.” This confidence may be justified. Republicans have spent all year trying to get a major piece of legislation passed; falling short on their tax plan, with an election year looming, would be an unmitigated disaster for the Party. Reaching an agreement on the final bill, however, is far from a mere technicality. While the House and Senate bills are broadly similar, they differ in a number of significant details. And, in tax policy, the devil is almost always in the details. For example, the bill passed in the House would abolish the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes, which are designed to insure that households and firms pay at least a certain amount of tax no matter how many deductions they have and how clever their accountants are. For revenue reasons, the Senate, in its version of the bill, decided to modify the A.M.T. rather than abolish it. Yet McCarthy, in his CNBC interview, insisted that the corporate A.M.T. has to be eliminated. House Republicans also vehemently oppose keeping the personal A.M.T., and here they are likely to have an ally in the White House. In 2005, the most recent year for which we have seen Donald Trump’s tax returns, being forced to pay the A.M.T. raised his tax burden considerably. Then there is the estate tax. Under the House bill, this tax—which hits on a few thousands bequests each year—would eventually be eliminated. In the Senate version, the threshold for being subjected to the tax would be doubled to eleven million dollars, but the tax would remain on the books. Other politically sensitive differences between the two bills include how they treat sick people and university students. Under the House bill, households that run up big medical bills would no longer be able to deduct the cost from their taxes, and graduate-school-tuition waivers would be treated as taxable income. The Senate bill doesn’t include either of these provisions, which the tax writers in the House included to raise revenue. Even if the Republican conferees can reach an agreement on these provisions, there are two explosive non-tax issues that need to be resolved: the fate of the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, and the legal protections afforded to people who were brought to this country as undocumented immigrants when they were children—the “Dreamers.” Senate Republican leaders, in their drive to get to fifty-one votes, made pledges regarding these issues to two key senators: Susan Collins, of Maine, who helped defeat the G.O.P. effort to repeal Obamacare; and Jeff Flake, of Arizona, who is a fierce critic of President Trump. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Abolition of the individual mandate, which would devastate the Obamacare insurance exchanges, was part of the Senate bill but not the House one. Over the weekend, Collins said that in return for her vote for the Senate bill, Party leaders agreed to pass a separate piece of legislation—put forward by the Republican senator Lamar Alexander and the Democratic senator Patty Murray—designed to prop up the exchanges. “I got a commitment that we’re going to pass two bills, including the Alexander-Murray bill, and one that I’ve authored that will help offset the individual-mandate repeal by lowering premiums,” Collins said, on “Meet the Press.” “I also got an ironclad commitment that we’re not going to see cuts in the Medicaid/Medicare program as a result of this bill.” Flake, in announcing his support for the Senate tax bill, said that the Republican leadership had promised to work with him on the immigration issue, which arose from the Trump Administration’s determination to phase out the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (daca) program. (Under daca, “Dreamers” are entitled to remain in the United States and work legally.) Flake said that he had secured a commitment in favor of a “a growth-oriented legislative solution to enact fair and permanent protections for daca recipients.” At this stage, it is by no means clear that the G.O.P. leaders will be able to deliver on the pledges they made to Collins and Flake, which are already coming under fire from some ultra-conservatives in the House. “I think this is exactly what the American people are sick of: learning about trading votes to modify the healthcare system and one fifth of the economy in exchange for a tax vote,” Dave Brat, a hard-line member of the House Freedom Caucus, told the Daily Beast, on Monday. Representative Mark Walker, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said, “I find it problematic to be promising something that the House has shunned from very early on.” To be sure, these are just two voices, and most Republicans are desperate to get a tax bill passed. But getting the members of the Freedom Caucus and the likes of Collins and Flake to agree on anything won’t be easy, and, for procedural reasons, the members of the conference committee won’t have much freedom to maneuver. In order for the final legislation to pass the Senate with fifty-one votes rather than sixty, it will have to remain compliant with the Byrd Rule, which, among other things, means that the conferees can’t include any new provisions that would raise the budget deficit after 2027. If the committee decides to tilt the final legislation in the direction of one group of voters, or a particular interest group, for example, it will have to make up the lost revenue by hitting another group. All of this should give some hope to Democratic activists and other angry citizens who staged protests across the country over the weekend. These protests will continue. Today alone, the group NotOnePenny.org, which opposes any tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals, is holding events in more than a dozen towns and cities. Protesters are also targeting individual Republican senators and congressmen. On Monday, several people staged a sit-in at Collins’s office in Bangor, Maine. Opponents of the Republican tax proposal are hoping that, as it gets more scrutiny, it will become even more unpopular. On Monday, they got some more ammunition. The independent Tax Policy Center released a study of the bill that passed the Senate, and it showed that in 2018 about half of the tax cuts would go to the richest ten per cent of households. By 2027, the study said, the outcome would be even more slanted, with more than sixty per cent of the cuts going to the richest one per cent. Chances are that, by January 1st, this regressive and unnecessary sop to the Republican donor class will be the law of the land. Right now, though, it’s not quite a done deal.

The Senate’s Disastrous Health-Care Bill,7736,"How much of a surprise was the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the Senate’s super-secret health-care bill, which Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader, finally revealed last Thursday? There had been intimations, from President Trump, among others, that it would fix some of the destructiveness of the House bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would cause twenty-three million Americans to lose their insurance coverage. But it turns out that the Senate bill is just as miserable. The new C.B.O. estimate isn’t expected until next week, but there are indications that it won’t be good: the cuts to Medicaid, for example, may be even more severe than those in the House bill, which the C.B.O. calculated would amount to more than eight hundred billion dollars over the next ten years. The Senate bill jettisons standards for care so thoroughly that, under its terms, it isn’t clear what it would even mean to be covered. Before Obamacare, when people who had insurance developed a serious health condition, they often discovered that it wasn’t covered by their policy, or that there were so many co-payments, deductibles, mysterious charges, and caps—including lifetime caps—that their coverage amounted to little more than a discount coupon on something that remained unaffordable. People found themselves without coverage for hospitalization, prescription drugs, and pediatric and chronic-disease care. A key contribution of the Affordable Care Act was to define each of those services, and some others, as “essential health benefits”—services that a plan had to cover in order to call itself a plan. The House and the Senate bills both allow the states to waive the essential-benefit requirements. House Republicans justified this provision by expressing outrage at the inclusion of prenatal care in the benefits: Why, they asked, should men, who can’t get pregnant, have to pay for that? Such attempts to frame access to coverage as someone else’s problem are muddled as a matter of both practice and principle. In America, the category of the vulnerable is a broad one. Medicaid, for example, covers seventy-four million low-income Americans—a fifth of the population. There is no simple picture of this group; according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, thirty-four million are children, eleven million are disabled, and seven million are elderly, a large number of whom live in nursing facilities. Many of those people led middle-class or even affluent lives, until their savings were consumed by the cost of residential care, which, in large part, is not covered by Medicare; nearly two-thirds of nursing-home patients are, at some point, on Medicaid. One of Obamacare’s innovations was to expand Medicaid eligibility to include people slightly above the poverty level. The federal government now pays the states a percentage of what it costs them to care for eligible residents: if a state spends more, it gets more, within certain parameters. Both Republican plans would radically restructure the program, giving states limited sums. The states would then have to use their own money to make up for the shortfall—or they could choose to spend even less. This change would place particularly devastating financial pressures on the elderly, at a time when the population is aging. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Both plans would also strand many people afflicted by the opioid epidemic, a crisis that Trump and other Republicans have promised to address. In a letter to Senate leaders, protesting the Senate plan, major insurers noted that Medicaid pays for forty-one per cent of opioid-addiction treatment in the five states most affected. Meanwhile, many middle-class families rely on the A.C.A.’s essential health benefits, which include substance-abuse treatment, to deal with dependency issues. Now they will be more at risk of the financial collapse that addiction can bring, or perhaps have to watch loved ones drift away or die. The Republican plans will be catastrophic for Americans in all states—including the tens of millions who live in states represented by Republicans. McConnell, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and others have brushed off concerns from constituents who say that Obamacare has saved their lives by claiming that the program has already “collapsed.” This is not true; the exchanges are under pressure, largely because of the uncertainties that the Republicans have introduced, but the percentage of Americans who are uninsured has fallen from sixteen per cent to nine per cent. The rate of personal bankruptcy, often attributable to medical costs, has also fallen. Both Republican plans claim to protect people who have preëxisting conditions, another of the major advances of Obamacare. In the case of the House bill, that claim is plainly false: it does call for insurance companies to offer such plans, but it also allows them to make those plans prohibitively expensive, via state waivers. The Senate bill, in turn, professes to include price protection, but it presents insurers with other loopholes. And there are hints that even those protections might be traded away if McConnell needs to placate senators on the right in order to get the bill passed by next week, which is his goal. (The plan is to force it through with a simple majority, by the process known as reconciliation.) There are fifty-two Republicans in the Senate, so McConnell can afford to lose the support of only two. Within hours of the plan’s release, however, four senators—Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Ron Johnson—said that it was not conservative enough. This faction may take some comfort from the nearly one trillion dollars in tax cuts that come with the bill, most of them benefitting wealthier Americans. On Friday, Dean Heller, of Nevada, a state that Hillary Clinton won last year, signalled that he, too, would not support the bill as it stands, and other moderates may also defect. McConnell hasn’t even pretended to include the Democrats in the process, and much of the criticism of the Senate bill, like much of the criticism of the Trump Presidency, has centered on the idea that norms are being violated, and standards abandoned. But, though the plans are morally shocking, politically they are not. After all, nineteen Republican state legislatures or governors refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion. And even some of the senators who complained most loudly about the process, John McCain among them, are expected to vote for the bill. That pattern, of expressed dismay followed by opportunistic accession, was on display in the Party’s surrender to Trump during the Presidential campaign. But the gutting of health care isn’t something that congressional Republicans can pin on Trump.

A Bipartisan Way to Improve Medical Care,6466,"William Stanley Jevons, the nineteenth-century English economist, once wrote to a friend that he’d had no special ambition as a young man. He just did what he had to do. After his father went bankrupt in the iron business, in 1848, Jevons reluctantly left London for Sydney, to take a job analyzing the quality of the coinage at the Australian Mint. Somehow, this combination of work, family history, and deep boredom led Jevons to spend his days developing a theory about value, helping to start what is known as the marginal revolution. Before Jevons, economists thought that prices should be based on the cost of making goods. Jevons showed that prices should reflect the degree to which a consumer values a product. The marginal revolution taught a seeming paradox: if industrialists lowered their prices, they could make more money; more people would buy their goods, enabling economies of scale. It was a change in pricing strategy, almost as much as one in technology, that led to mass production and the modern world. There is one sector of the U.S. economy, however, that is stuck in the pre-Jevons conception of value: health care. The health-care crisis in the United States is in many ways a pricing crisis. Nearly all medical care is paid on a fee-for-service basis, which means that medical providers make more money if they perform more procedures. This is perverse. We don’t want an excess of health-care services, especially unnecessary ones; we want health. But hardly anybody gets paid when we are healthy. A superior payment model has existed in various corners of the country for a long time. Mark Twain, in recalling his youth in Missouri, described a Dr. Meredith, who “saved my life several times” and charged the families in town twenty-five dollars a year, whether they were sick or well. This is what is now called capitation, an ungainly name for a system in which a medical provider is paid a fixed amount per patient—these days, it is typically upward of ten thousand dollars a year—whether that person needs expensive surgery or just a checkup. This encourages maintaining health. Geisinger Health System, which is based in Danville, Pennsylvania, has used a capitation model for more than a century. Geisinger has long known that many of its diabetic patients live in areas with an abundance of fast-food places but no supermarkets. Last year, it began providing free, healthy groceries to those patients through a hospital pharmacy. “The results are so spectacular,” David Feinberg, the C.E.O. of Geisinger, told me. The average weight and blood pressure among diabetics fell, and fewer required dialysis or eye surgery, a costly side effect of unchecked diabetes. The cost for the food was two thousand dollars a year per patient. The savings from doing fewer procedures will come to more than twenty-four thousand dollars a year per patient. Similar experiments elsewhere in the country show better outcomes at a lower cost for joint replacement, post-surgical care, and over-all population health. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures So why isn’t capitation everywhere? One reason is history. The 1973 Health Maintenance Organization Act took a then obscure model of capitation and mandated it for all large companies that offered health insurance. The law was poorly written, and led to a proliferation of H.M.O.s that failed to cut costs and deprived people of care, putting many off the idea of capitation. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, experimented more gingerly with new payment systems. It left fee-for-service largely in place but created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, to explore alternative payment systems. The center’s experiments have shown that, in order to assure adequate care, providers must be rewarded based on objective indicators of health—to prevent doctors from profiting by withholding care—and that patient groups must be large enough and diverse enough that treating sick people does not jeopardize the financial health of providers. Capitation, at its best, both improves health care and cuts costs. David Feinberg estimates that replacing fee-for-service with per-patient payment would cut the nation’s health-care costs in half; others believe that the savings would be closer to ten per cent, which, for an industry that makes up nearly a fifth of the economy, would still mean an enormous savings. Capitation even has bipartisan support. Paul Ryan has called for alternatives to fee-for-service, as have both conservative and liberal think tanks. The left and right continue to argue about who should pay, the government or the private sector, but it is still remarkable that they find anything to agree on. It’s strange, then, that in the rush to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act the pricing of health-care services has scarcely been mentioned. The health-care bill recently passed by the House of Representatives would transfer money to the rich (in the form of a tax cut) and slash Medicaid, which would lead to an existential crisis for many health-care providers, leaving them in no shape to overturn the way they charge for their services. If Republicans in Congress read their Jevons, they might appreciate that a properly designed payment system could, with time and good faith, lower costs and government spending while improving the health of Americans. Jevons seemed to anticipate this moment. He wrote that politicians are often asked to lower taxes to “leave the money to fructify in the hands of the people.” But, he reasoned, a short-term postponement of tax cuts could favor a long-term improvement of fiscal health. “Could a minister be found strong and bold enough” to make such common-sense economic policy, he wrote, “he would have an almost unprecedented claim to gratitude and fame.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Politics of Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” Bill,9028,"In her new book, “What Happened,” Hillary Clinton writes that Senator Bernie Sanders “isn’t a Democrat.” Technically, she’s right. Sanders’s own Web site describes him as “the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history.” But as Clinton sets out on her promotional tour, it is Sanders, the losing candidate in last year’s hotly contested Democratic primary, who is helping to set the Party’s policy agenda. “This is where the country has got to go,” Sanders told the Washington Post’s David Weigel on Tuesday, a day before he unveiled a single-payer health-care-reform bill in the Senate. “Right now, if we want to move away from a dysfunctional, wasteful, bureaucratic system into a rational health-care system that guarantees coverage to everyone in a cost-effective way, the only way to do it is Medicare for All.” The slogan “Medicare for all” is another term for a single-payer health-care system, in which the federal government insures everybody and finances the scheme from tax revenues. Under Sanders’s proposal, which broadly mimics a proposal he put forward during his Presidential campaign, every American under the age of eighteen would receive a “universal Medicare card” as soon as the bill was signed into law. For everybody else, there would be a four-year transition period. Almost all forms of medical coverage, from preventative care to major surgery, would eventually be covered, and there would be no payments. “When you have co-payments—when you say that health care is not a right for everybody, whether you’re poor or whether you’re a billionaire—the evidence suggests that it becomes a disincentive for people to get the health care they need,” Sanders told Weigel. With Republicans in control of Congress, there is obviously no immediate chance of Sanders’s bill becoming law. But, in the days leading up to its unveiling, the trickle of senators who had agreed to co-sponsor the measure turned into a torrent. In the end, there were sixteen co-sponsors. They included Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin; Cory Booker, of New Jersey; Al Franken, of Minnesota; Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York; Kamala Harris, of California; Jeff Merkley, of Oregon; Brian Schatz, of Hawaii; and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts. One thing all these politicians have in common is that they have been mentioned, with varying degrees of plausibility, as possible Presidential candidates in 2020. (So has Sanders himself.) Since Donald Trump has been in the Oval Office for less than eight months, it might seem crazy to be thinking about the next election. But that is the reality of Presidential politics these days: a semi-permanent campaign. And, as a number of progressive groups have already expressed support for the Sanders bill, anyone looking for their support in 2020 would be taking a risk by not falling in line. A poll taken during the summer by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated that sixty-four per cent of self-identified Democrats now support a single-payer system. A more recent survey from Gallup produced similar results. These are the voters who will decide who wins the Democratic primaries. For the more centrist could-be candidates, such as Booker and Harris, supporting the “Medicare for all” bill is a good way of signalling that they understand the Party’s center of gravity has moved to the left. “This is something that’s got to happen,” Booker said to NJTV, in explaining his decision to support the Sanders bill. “Obamacare was a first step in advancing this country, but I won’t rest until every American has a basic security that comes with having access to affordable health care.” And it isn’t only Democrats who respond positively to the notion of a national health-care plan. The Kaiser survey from this summer showed that fifty-three per cent of all respondents say they favor a single-payer health-care system. In recent years, the biggest gains have come among self-identified independents, fifty-five per cent of whom now express support. Only among self-identified Republicans is the Sanders approach unpopular. Even in this group, though, a substantial minority (twenty-eight per cent) said that they would support a single-payer system. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media One reading of these figures is that most Americans have had their fill of the private health-care system, and, when they are presented with an alternative that offers them the prospect of no longer having to deal with insurance companies, they like the sound of it. “I think the American people are sick and tired of filling out forms,” Sanders told Weigel. “Your income went up—you can’t get this. Your income went down—you can’t get that. You’ve got to argue with insurance companies about what you thought you were getting.” Shifting from the current system to a single-payer system would, however, be a huge transformation, and, when pollsters point out to survey participants some of the things such a change would entail, support for the Sanders approach tends to drop quite sharply. For example, after the Kaiser researchers told people who initially said they favored a “Medicare for all” system that it would involve many Americans paying higher taxes, almost four in ten respondents changed their minds. The number opposing the proposal went from forty-three per cent to sixty per cent. Eying numbers like these, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the two Democratic leaders in Congress, have reacted cautiously to Sanders’s proposal. Eager to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in next year’s midterm elections, they know Republicans are keen to label the Democrats as the Party that wants to raise taxes and impose a government takeover of health care. Schumer and Pelosi are also keen to keep the focus on saving the Affordable Care Act, which the White House seems intent on undermining. When Schumer was asked about the Sanders bill on Tuesday, he was noncommittal. “Democrats believe that health care is a right for all, and there are many different bills out there,” he said. “There are many good ones.” Pelosi also declined to endorse the Sanders bill, saying it should be put on the table with the other Democratic proposals. “Right now, I’m protecting the Affordable Care Act,” she said. “None of these other things . . . can really prevail unless we have the Affordable Care Act protected.” Sanders, at this stage, doesn’t seem keen to engage in the details about how to pay for his plan. His draft legislation doesn’t address the issue, and he told Weigel that there would be a separate bill to deal with it. “Rather than give a detailed proposal about how we’re going to raise three trillion dollars a year, we’d rather give the American people options,” he said. Last month, Sanders told National Public Radio that the real goal of his bill was to start a national conversation. That is all very well. For decades, many have regarded the idea of establishing a national health-care system with truly universal access—something almost all other advanced countries already have—as too radical to get any traction. Sanders deserves a lot of credit for bringing it into the mainstream. But, since his new bill is lacking key details, it should be regarded as the legislative expression of a shared aspiration rather than as a blueprint for action, or as a death knell for the Affordable Care Act. Many of the bill’s co-sponsors seem content to see it in this light. “I always have believed that our goal must be universal health care coverage for everyone, and my support for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation being introduced this week is a statement of that belief,” Baldwin wrote, in an an op-ed for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. She also described the Sanders proposal as “one of many paths we can take to expand coverage and lower health care costs.” On his Facebook page, Franken struck a similar note. “This bill is aspirational, and I’m hopeful that it can serve as a starting point for where we need to go as a country,” he wrote. “In the short term, however, I strongly believe we must pursue bipartisan policies that improve our current health care system for all Americans—and that’s exactly what we’re doing right now in the Senate Health Committee, on which both Senator Sanders and I sit.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Danger of President Pence,82225,"On September 14th, the right-wing pundit Ann Coulter, who last year published a book titled “In Trump We Trust,” expressed what a growing number of Americans, including conservatives, have been feeling since the 2016 election. The previous day, President Trump had dined with Democratic leaders at the White House, and had impetuously agreed to a major policy reversal, granting provisional residency to undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. Coulter tweeted, “At this point, who doesn’t want Trump impeached?” She soon added, “If we’re not getting a wall, I’d prefer President Pence.” Trump’s swerve did the unthinkable—uniting Coulter and liberal commentators. After Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Gail Collins, the Times columnist, praised Vice-President Mike Pence as someone who at least “seems less likely to get the planet blown up.” This summer, an opinion column by Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post, appeared under the headline “ ‘president pence’ is sounding better and better.” Pence, who has dutifully stood by the President, mustering a devotional gaze rarely seen since the days of Nancy Reagan, serves as a daily reminder that the Constitution offers an alternative to Trump. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. The more Trump is mired in scandal, the more likely Pence’s elevation to the Oval Office becomes, unless he ends up legally entangled as well. Pence’s odds of becoming President are long but not prohibitive. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. After Lyndon Johnson decided to join the ticket with John F. Kennedy, he calculated his odds of ascension to be approximately one in four, and is said to have told Clare Boothe Luce, “I’m a gambling man, darling, and this is the only chance I’ve got.” If the job is a gamble for Pence, he himself is something of a gamble for the country. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. And, with all the infighting in the new Administration, few have focussed on Pence’s power within the White House. Newt Gingrich told me recently that the three people with the most policy influence in the Administration are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and Pence. Gingrich went on, “Others have some influence, such as Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. He’s in the national-security briefings.” Moreover, and crucially, Pence is the only official in the White House who can’t be fired. Pence, who declined requests for an interview, is also one of the few with whom Trump hasn’t overtly feuded. “The President considers him one of his best decisions,” Tony Fabrizio, a pollster for Trump, told me. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. “You end up with an odd pair of throwbacks from fifties casting,” the former White House strategist Stephen Bannon joked, comparing them to Dean Martin, the bad boy of the Rat Pack, and “the dad on ‘Leave It to Beaver.’ ” Trump and Pence are misaligned politically, too. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counsellor, who became a pollster for Pence in 2009, describes him as “a full-spectrum conservative” on social, moral, economic, and defense issues. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. According to Bannon, Pence is “the outreach guy, the connective tissue” between the Trump Administration and the most conservative wing of the Republican establishment. “Trump’s got the populist nationalists,” Bannon said. “But Pence is the base. Without Pence, you don’t win.” Pence has taken care to appear extraordinarily loyal to Trump, so much so that Joel K. Goldstein, a historian and an expert on Vice-Presidents who teaches law at St. Louis University, refers to him as the “Sycophant-in-Chief.” But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. He also has a close relationship with the conservative billionaire donors who have captured the Republican Party’s agenda in recent years. During the 2016 campaign, Trump characterized the Republican Party’s big spenders as “highly sophisticated killers” whose donations allowed them to control politicians. When he declared his candidacy, he claimed that, because of his real-estate fortune, he did not need support from “rich donors,” and he denounced super pacs, their depositories of unlimited campaign contributions, as “corrupt.” Pence’s political career, though, has been sponsored at almost every turn by the donors whom Trump has assailed. Pence is the inside man of the conservative money machine. On Election Night, the dissonance between Trump’s populist supporters and Pence’s billionaire sponsors was quietly evident. When Trump gave his acceptance speech, in the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan, he vowed to serve “the forgotten men and women of our country,” and promised to “rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, and hospitals.” Upstairs, in a room reserved for Party élites, several of the richest and most conservative donors, all of whom support drastic reductions in government spending, were celebrating. Doug Deason, a Texas businessman and a political donor, recalled to me, “It was amazing. In the V.I.P. reception area, there was an even more V.I.P. room, and I counted at least eight or nine billionaires.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Deason’s father, Darwin, founded a data-processing company, Affiliated Computer Services, and in 2010 he sold it to Xerox for $6.4 billion. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. “Mike and I are pretty good friends,” Deason said, adding, “He’s really the contact to the big donors.” Since the election, Deason has attended two dinners for wealthy backers at the Vice-Presidential residence. Among the billionaires who gathered in the room at the Hilton, Deason recalled, were the financier Wilbur Ross, whom Trump later appointed his Secretary of Commerce; the corporate investor Carl Icahn, who became a top adviser to Trump but resigned eight months later, when allegations of financial impropriety were published by The New Yorker; Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil-and-gas company that has made billions of dollars through fracking; and David Koch, the richest resident of New York City. Koch’s presence was especially unexpected. He and his brother Charles are libertarians who object to most government spending, including investments in infrastructure. They co-own virtually all of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the United States, and have long tapped their combined fortune—currently ninety billion dollars—to finance candidates, think tanks, pressure groups, and political operatives who support an anti-tax and anti-regulatory agenda, which dovetails with their financial interests. During the campaign, Trump said that Republican rivals who attended secretive donor summits sponsored by the Kochs were “puppets.” The Kochs, along with several hundred allied donors, had amassed nearly nine hundred million dollars to spend on the Presidential election, but declined to support Trump’s candidacy. At one point, Charles Koch described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as one between “cancer or heart attack.” Marc Short, the head of legislative affairs in the Trump White House, credits Pence for the Kochs’ rapprochement with Trump. “The Kochs were very excited about the Vice-Presidential pick,” Short told me. “There are areas where they differ from the Administration, but now there are many areas they’re partnering with us on.” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, who has accused the Kochs of buying undue influence, particularly on environmental policy—Koch Industries has a long history of pollution—is less enthusiastic about their alliance with Pence. “If Pence were to become President for any reason, the government would be run by the Koch brothers—period. He’s been their tool for years,” he said. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency. He told me, “I’m concerned he’d be a President that the Kochs would own.” This summer, I visited Pence’s home town of Columbus, Indiana. Harry McCawley, a retired editor at the Republic, the local newspaper, told me, “Mike Pence wanted to be President practically since he popped out of the womb.” Pence exudes a low-key humility, but, McCawley told me, “he’s very ambitious, even calculating, about the steps he’ll take toward that goal.” McCawley, who died, of cancer, in September, knew the Pence family well, in part because the Vice-President’s mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch, wrote a chatty column for the newspaper for several years (“memories blossom with arrival of spring”). Eighty-four and energetic, Fritsch met me for coffee this summer, along with her eldest son, Gregory, who is in the antiques business in the Columbus area. Like the Vice-President, they are good-looking, with chiselled features, and have an unpretentious, amiable manner. They ribbed each other as they reminisced about the years when the Pences’ six children lived with their parents in a series of modest houses. There was so little to do in the way of entertainment, Gregory Pence recalled, that “we sometimes got in the car with our parents on Friday nights and followed after the fire truck.” All the boys had nicknames. “My name was General Harassment,” Gregory said. “Michael’s was Bubbles, because he was chubby and funny.” “Michael’s hilarious,” his mother agreed. “I attribute it to the Irish. We’re faith-filled, and have a good sense of humor.” The family identifies as Catholic, and Mike was an altar boy. “Religion is the most important thing in our lives,” she said. “But we don’t take it seriously. I don’t proselytize.” Pence’s maternal grandfather was from Ireland, but his paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence, Sr., came from a German family. Brief mentions of Edward in the press have described him as having worked in the Chicago stockyards, leaving the impression that he was poor. But Gregory told me that Edward was well off, with a seat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. “Grandfather Pence was a very hard man,” Gregory said. Edward refused to provide financial support when Gregory and Mike’s father, Edward, Jr., went to college; an aunt loaned him the tuition, but he had to leave law school when he ran out of money. “Grampa Pence was a gambler!” Fritsch chimed in. “He played cards and went to Las Vegas.” Fritsch went to secretarial school. With a laugh, she recalled that she met her first husband “in a club—in other words, a tavern.” A Korean War veteran, Edward Pence, Jr., was in uniform that night. (He had won a Bronze Star, which the Vice-President keeps in his office.) In 1959, after leaving law school, he moved with Fritsch from Chicago to Columbus, where he sold fuel to gas stations, farms, and convenience stores. Shortly after their arrival, Michael Pence, the couple’s third child, was born. Fritsch said of life in Indiana, “I hated it. I always looked forward to going back to Chicago.” But the family stayed, gradually moving into the upper middle class—Edward became part owner of an oil distributorship—and switching from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Fritsch had worshipped the Kennedys, but, she said, “I guess I became a Republican because my husband was one. I was a Stepford wife.” “She was like the Scarecrow in ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ ” Gregory said at one point. “You see what I have to put up with?” she shot back. Growing more serious, she explained that, until she went back to school, at sixty-five, to get a college degree in psychology, she “didn’t have much self-esteem.” “That’s when she got her brain,” Gregory said. Edward, Jr., like his father, was a tough disciplinarian. Gregory recalled, “If you lied to him, you’d be taken upstairs, have a conversation, and then he’d whack you with a belt.” He expected his children to stand up whenever an adult entered the room. “He’d grab you if you didn’t,” Gregory said. At dinner, the kids were forbidden to speak. While Gregory was in college, he was sleeping late on a visit home when his father pulled the covers off him and told him to get up for church. “I said he couldn’t tell me what to do anymore, because he was only paying half my college tuition,” Gregory said. His father stopped paying his tuition altogether. “He was black and white,” Gregory said. “You were never confused where you stood. My brother’s a lot like him.” Columbus, which has a population of forty-five thousand, was dominated by a major engine manufacturer, Cummins, and escaped the economic woes that afflicted many other parts of the region. But McCawley, the newspaper editor, told me that, while Pence was growing up, Columbus, “like many Indiana communities, still had vestiges of the Ku Klux Klan.” The group had ruled the state’s government in the twenties, and then gone underground. In Columbus, landlords refused to rent or sell homes to African-Americans until Cummins’s owners demanded that they do so. Gregory Pence insisted that the town “was not racist,” but contended that there had been anti-Catholic prejudice. Protestant kids had thrown stones at him, he recalled. “We were discriminated against,” Pence’s mother added. The Pence children attended St. Columba Catholic School through eighth grade. Mike discovered a talent for public speaking that made him a favorite with the nuns. In fifth grade, he won a local oratory contest, defeating kids several years older. “When it came his turn, his voice just boomed out over the audience,” his mother told the newspaper. “He just blew everybody away.” In high school, Pence won third place in a national contest. When his mother recalled Mike as “a good student,” Gregory said, “Not a fabulous one. I don’t think he stood out. He was class president, but that wasn’t cool.” Nonetheless, by senior year, Mike was talking to classmates about becoming President of the United States. Mike Pence attended Hanover College, a liberal-arts school in southeast Indiana. On a visit home, he told his father that he was thinking of either joining the priesthood or attending law school. His father suggested he start with law; he could always join the priesthood later. Shortly thereafter, to his family’s surprise, Pence became an evangelical Christian. His mother said that “college gave him a different viewpoint.” The story Pence tells is that he was in a fraternity, and when he admired another member’s gold cross he was told, “You have to wear it in your heart before you wear it around your neck.” Soon afterward, Pence has said, he attended a Christian music festival in Kentucky and “gave my life to Jesus.” His conversion was part of a larger movement. In 1979, during Pence’s junior year in college, Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, to mobilize Christian voters as a political force. Pence voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980, but he soon joined the march of many Christians toward the Republican Party. The Moral Majority’s co-founder, Paul Weyrich, a Midwestern Catholic, established numerous institutions of the conservative movement, including the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of far-right congressional members, which Pence eventually led. Weyrich condemned homosexuality, feminism, abortion, and government-imposed racial integration, and he partnered with some controversial figures, including Laszlo Pasztor, a former member of a pro-Nazi party in Hungary. When Weyrich died, in 2008, Pence praised him as a “friend and mentor” and a “founding father of the modern conservative movement,” from whom he had “benefitted immeasurably.” While in law school, at Indiana University, Pence met and married Karen Batten, a schoolteacher whom he had noticed playing guitar in a church service. A friend at the time, Dan LeClerc, told me, “He was head over heels.” Pence took her ice-skating; she made him taco salad for dinner. Soon, anticipating a proposal, she began carrying in her purse a gold cross with the inscription “Yes.” Eight months after they began dating, he asked her to marry him, having buried a ring box in a loaf of bread that he’d brought on a walk, ostensibly to feed ducks. They shellacked the loaf. Pence’s friends have called Karen his “prayer warrior.” The couple became almost inseparable. One Christmas, she gave him an antique red phone, connected to a “hotline” whose number only she knew. As the Washington Post reported, he kept it on his office desk long after the advent of cell phones. At home, they worked out on twin treadmills. And, as Rolling Stone reported in January, he referred to her in front of guests as “Mother.” Pence’s office has disputed the account, but a former Indiana Democratic Party official told me, “I’ve heard him call her Mother myself.” Pence also began observing what’s known as the Billy Graham rule, meaning that he never dined alone with another woman, or attended an event in mixed company where alcohol was served unless his wife was present. Critics have argued that this approach reduces women to sexual temptresses and precludes men from working with women on an equal basis. A Trump campaign official said that he found the Pences’ dynamic “a little creepy.” But Kellyanne Conway defended him vigorously, telling me, “I’ve been a female top adviser of his for years, and never felt excluded or dismissed.” She went on, “Most wives would appreciate a loyal husband who puts them first. People are trying to bloody and muddy him, but talk about narrow-minded—to judge his marriage!” In 1987, a year after Pence graduated from law school, LeClerc, his old friend, was asked by a mutual acquaintance, “Guess who’s running for Congress?” He drew a blank. Pence’s decision, at the age of twenty-nine, to challenge a popular incumbent Democratic congressman surprised many people, including his father, Edward, who thought that it was silly, given that Mike was a young newlywed with no steady job. But after Mike entered the race Edward became his biggest booster, helping him raise money and put up lawn signs. Then, just a few weeks before the Republican primary, Edward, who was fifty-eight, had a heart attack and died. Mike won the primary, but the Democratic incumbent, Phil Sharp, was reëlected. In 1990, Pence tried and failed again to unseat Sharp, waging a campaign that is remembered as especially nasty. One ad featured an actor dressed in Middle Eastern garb and sunglasses, who accused Sharp, falsely, of being a tool of Arab oil interests. But Pence’s campaign foundered after the press revealed that he had used donations toward personal expenses, such as his mortgage and groceries. It wasn’t technically illegal, but it violated the trust of his supporters and sullied his pious image. “Mike burned a lot of bridges,” Gregory recalled. “He upset a lot of his backers. It was partly because of immaturity, but he really was kind of full of shit.” The following year, Mike Pence wrote an essay, carried by local newspapers, titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” in which he said, “A campaign ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate.” He admitted to reporters that he had violated this standard, and said that he had no “interest in running for elected office in the foreseeable future,” but added that if he ever did he would not wage a negative campaign. “I think he realized he’d besmirched himself,” Sharp told me. “He comes across as Midwestern nice, but it was mean and shallow.” Sharp, who after two more terms joined the faculty at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and is now semi-retired, remains unimpressed by Pence. “This is not a person, in my limited exposure, about whom I’d ever say, ‘Wow, he should be President!’ ” Pence took a job at a law firm in Indianapolis, where he handled mainly small-claims and family cases, and started each day by praying with colleagues. An Indiana attorney recalled, “He was a big, jocular, friendly guy who would put his arm around you at the local pub. He probably weighed a hundred pounds more than today.” There was a clear hierarchy in the Indianapolis legal world, and Pence was far from its top rungs, relying on referrals for work. “There were dozens of guys like that,” the lawyer said. “But the great American story is that a guy like Mike Pence is now Vice-President.” Gregory said of his brother, “Law wasn’t really his thing,” adding, “He’s completely unmotivated by money. I don’t think he would think for one second about it, if it weren’t for Karen.” “Service is his motivation,” Pence’s mother said. “And, of course, popularity,” his brother added. “He had ambitions.” Pence was thrown a lifeline in 1991, when he was offered a job as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a tiny new think tank that promoted free-market policies. Pence joked that some people called the foundation “an old-folks home for unsuccessful candidates,” but it gave him a steady paycheck and valuable exposure to the burgeoning universe of business-funded conservative nonprofit groups. The foundation was part of the State Policy Network, a national web of organizations that had been launched at Ronald Reagan’s suggestion. It was designed to replicate at a more local level the Heritage Foundation’s successful promotion of conservative policies. One of the State Policy Network’s founders, Thomas Roe, a construction magnate with strong anti-union views, was said to have told a Heritage board member, “You capture the Soviet Union—I’m going to capture the states.” In a 2008 speech, Pence described himself as “part of what we called the seed corn Heritage Foundation was spreading around the country in the state think-tank movement.” It isn’t fully clear whose money was behind the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, because think tanks, as nonprofits, don’t have to disclose their donors. But the early funders of the Heritage Foundation included some Fortune 500 companies, in fields such as oil, chemicals, and tobacco, that opposed health, safety, and environmental regulations. Cecil Bohanon, one of two adjunct scholars at Pence’s think tank, had a history of financial ties to tobacco-company front groups, and in 2000 Pence echoed industry talking points in an essay that argued, “Smoking doesn’t kill. In fact, two out of every three smokers doesn’t die from a smoking-related illness.” A greater “scourge” than cigarettes, he argued, was “big government disguised as do-gooder, healthcare rhetoric.” Bohanon, who still writes for the think tank’s publication, also has ties to the Kochs. Last year, John Hardin, the head of university relations for the Charles Koch Foundation, told an Indiana newspaper that the Kochs had been funding Bohanon’s work as a professor of free-market economics at Ball State University “for years.” Even as Pence argued for less government interference in business, he pushed for policies that intruded on people’s private lives. In the early nineties, he joined the board of the Indiana Family Institute, a far-right group that supported the criminalization of abortion and campaigned against equal rights for homosexuals. And, while Pence ran the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, it published an essay arguing that unmarried women should be denied access to birth control. “What these people are really after is contraceptives,” Vi Simpson, the former Democratic minority leader of the Indiana State Senate, told me. In 2012, after serving twenty-eight years in the legislature, she ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with the gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg, who lost the election to Pence. Simpson believes that Pence wants to reverse women’s economic and political advances. “He’s on a mission,” she said. Pence’s true gift was not as a thinker but as a talker. In 1992, he became a host on conservative talk radio, which had been booming since the F.C.C., in 1987, repealed the Fairness Doctrine and stopped requiring broadcasters to provide all sides of controversial issues. At a time when bombastic, angry voices proliferated, Pence was different. Like Reagan, who had become his political hero, he could present even extreme positions in genial, nonthreatening terms. “I’m a conservative, but I’m not mad about it,” he liked to say. He welcomed guests of all political stripes, and called himself “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” “His radio career gave him great statewide name recognition,” Jeff Smulyan, the C.E.O. of Emmis Communications, on whose radio stations Pence’s program aired, said. “He’s likable, and a great self-promoter.” Smulyan, a Democrat, added, “I’m not sure how he’d fare in a detailed policy debate, but Mike knows what Mike believes.” In 1994, Pence was on eighteen Emmis stations, five days a week. By then, he’d lost weight and had three children; he’d also amassed a Rolodex full of conservative connections and established a national network of wealthy funders. In 2000, when a Republican congressman in northern Indiana vacated his seat, Pence ran as the Party favorite, on a platform that included a promise to oppose “any effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws.” He won, by a twelve-point margin. Once Pence got to Washington, Conway said, his background “in the think-tank-slash-media axis really equipped him to defend and explain an argument in a full-throated way.” Pence was in demand on the conservative speaking circuit, and frequently appeared on Sunday talk shows. “He was invited to Heritage, gun owners’ groups, property-rights groups, pro-life groups, and pro-Israel groups,” Conway recalled. “People started to see an authentic, affable conservative who was not in a bad mood about it.” Michael Leppert, a Democratic lobbyist in Indiana, saw Pence differently. “His politics were always way outside the mainstream,” Leppert said. “He just does it with a smile on his face instead of a snarl.” Pence served twelve years in Congress, but never authored a single successful bill. His sights, according to Leppert, were always “on the national ticket.” He gained attention by challenging his own party’s leaders, both in Congress and in the George W. Bush Administration, from the right. He broke with the vast majority of his Republican peers by opposing Bush’s expansion of Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs, along with the No Child Left Behind initiative and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the government’s emergency bailout of banks. Conway calls him “a rebel with a cause.” In 2004, the House’s most conservative members elected him to head their caucus, the Republican Study Committee. Pence joked that the group was so alien to the Party’s mainstream that running it was like leading a “Star Trek” convention. “He was as far right as you could go without falling off the earth,” Mike Lofgren, a former Republican congressional staff member, who has become a Trump critic, told me. “But he never really put a foot wrong politically. Beneath the Bible-thumping earnestness was a calculating and ambitious pol.” In 2006, Pence boldly challenged the House Minority Leader at the time, John Boehner, a more centrist Republican from Ohio, for his post. Pence got wiped out, but in 2008 Boehner—perhaps trying to contain Pence’s ambition—asked him to serve as the Republican Conference chair, the Party’s third-highest-ranking post in the House. The chair presides over weekly meetings in which Republican House members discuss policy and legislative goals. Pence used the platform to set the Party’s message on a rightward course, raise money, and raise his profile. After Barack Obama was elected President, Pence became an early voice of the Tea Party movement, which opposed taxes and government spending with an angry edge. Pence’s tone grew more militant, too. In 2011, he made the evening news by threatening to shut down the federal government unless it defunded Planned Parenthood. Some Hoosiers were unnerved to see footage of Pence standing amid rowdy protesters at a Tea Party rally and yelling, “Shut it down!” His radicalism, however, only boosted his national profile. Pence became best known for fiercely opposing abortion. He backed “personhood” legislation that would ban it under all circumstances, including rape and incest, unless a woman’s life was at stake. He sponsored an unsuccessful amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have made it legal for government-funded hospitals to turn away a dying woman who needed an abortion. (Later, as governor of Indiana, he signed a bill barring women from aborting a physically abnormal fetus; the bill also required fetal burial or cremation, including after a miscarriage. A federal judge recently found the law unconstitutional.) Pence’s close relationship with dozens of conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ top political organization, was crucial to his rise. A key link to these groups was provided by Marc Short, the current White House official, who in 2008 became Pence’s chief of staff at the Republican Conference. Short had grown up in moneyed conservative circles in Virginia, where his father had helped finance the growth of the Republican Party, and he had run a group for conservative students, Young America’s Foundation, and spent several years as a Republican Senate aide before joining Pence’s staff. His wife, as it happened, worked for the Charles Koch Foundation, and he admired the brothers’ anti-government ideology. A former White House colleague described Short to me as “a pod person” who “really delivered Pence to the Kochs.” In June, 2009, Short brokered Pence’s first invitation to address a Koch “seminar,” as the brothers call their secretive semi-annual fund-raising sessions for top conservative donors. The theme of the gathering, in Aspen, Colorado, was “Understanding and Addressing Threats to American Free Enterprise and Prosperity.” Pence’s speech was a hit. Short told me, “I’ve never seen someone who can take a complex subject and distill it in a heartbeat like he can.” He’d also never seen “anyone who is as dedicated a public servant, and lives their faith as Mike does.” Short, who is a devout Christian, said, “People often profess faith that’s not lived out, but with him it’s lived out each and every day. It guides him. It’s his core.” The Kochs, who are not religious, may have been focussed more on pocketbook issues than on Pence’s faith. According to Scott Peterson, the executive director of the Checks & Balances Project, a watchdog group that monitors attempts to influence environmental policy, Pence was invited to the Koch seminar only after he did the brothers a major political favor. By the spring of 2009, Koch Industries, like other fossil-fuel companies, felt threatened by growing support in Congress for curbing carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. Americans for Prosperity devised a “No Climate Tax” pledge for candidates to sign, promising not to spend any government funds on limiting carbon pollution. At first, the campaign languished, attracting only fourteen signatures. The House, meanwhile, was moving toward passage of a “cap and trade” bill, which would charge companies for carbon pollution. If the bill were enacted, the costs could be catastrophic to Koch Industries, which releases some twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year, and owns millions of acres of untapped oil reserves in Canada, plus coal-fired power plants and oil refineries. Pence, who had called global warming “a myth” created by environmentalists in their “latest Chicken Little attempt to raise taxes,” took up the Kochs’ cause. He not only signed their pledge but urged others to do so as well. He gave speeches denouncing the cap-and-trade bill—which passed the House but got held up in the Senate—as a “declaration of war on the Midwest.” His language echoed that of the Koch groups. Americans for Prosperity called the bill “the largest excise tax in history,” and Pence called it “the largest tax increase in American history.” (Neither statement was true.) He used a map created by the Heritage Foundation, which the Kochs supported, to make his case, and he urged House Republicans to hold “energy summits” opposing the legislation in their districts, sending them home over the summer recess with kits to bolster their presentations. According to the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, after Pence began promoting the Kochs’ pledge the number of signatories in the House soared, reaching a hundred and fifty-six. James Valvo, the policy director for Americans for Prosperity, who spearheaded the pledge, told the Reporting Workshop that support from Pence and other Republicans helped “a scrappy outlier” become “the established position.” The cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate. Short said that he “didn’t recall the Kochs ever asking for help on the issue,” adding, “The Republican Conference believed it was a winning issue because of the impact that the bill would have had on jobs.” In any event, the pledge marked a pivotal turn in the climate-change debate, cementing Republican opposition to addressing the environmental crisis. Peterson said that the Checks & Balances Project hadn’t detected “much money going from the Kochs to Pence before he promoted the ‘No Climate Tax’ pledge.” Afterward, “he was the Kochs’ guy, and they’ve been showering him with money ever since.” Peterson went on, “He could see a pathway to the Presidency with them behind him.” Indeed, by 2011 Pence had reportedly become Charles Koch’s favorite potential candidate for President in 2012. Andrew Downs, a political scientist who directs the nonpartisan Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics, in Fort Wayne, said, “People thought Pence was gearing up for a Presidential run.” Downs pointed out that when Pence was in Congress “he probably had a shot at becoming Speaker of the House.” Downs continued, “Instead, he spoke at a lot of engagements with a national focus, and visited places like Iowa and New Hampshire. Running for President isn’t an idea that just occurred to Mike Pence when he joined the ticket in 2016. It goes back a long way.” But the House of Representatives is a tough platform from which to get elected President. And so, in 2012, after mulling over his national prospects, Pence ran instead for governor of Indiana. “The conventional wisdom is that he ran for governor so he could check that box, get some executive experience, and then run for President,” Downs said. Pence won the governor’s race, but with only forty-nine per cent of the vote. “He was scary to the center,” Bill Oesterle, a co-founder of Angie’s List, an Indiana company that collates user reviews of local contractors, said. Oesterle, a Republican, contributed a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to Pence’s campaign. David Koch contributed two hundred thousand dollars. Pence’s commitment to the Kochs was now ironclad. Short, his former chief of staff, had become a top operative for the Kochs, earning upward of a million dollars a year as president of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the brothers’ Virginia-based membership group for big conservative donors. It served as a dark-money bank, enabling donors to stay anonymous while distributing funds to favored campaigns and political organizations. (During the past decade, the group has pooled an estimated billion and a half dollars in contributions.) The Kochs’ national political network, which had offices in nearly every state, became the most powerful and best-financed private political machine in the country. At least four other former Pence staffers followed Short’s lead and joined the Koch network, including Emily Seidel, who joined Freedom Partners, and Matt Lloyd, who became a Koch Industries spokesman. In 2014, a Republican strategist told Politico that “the whole Koch operation” had become “the shadow headquarters of Pence for President.” Pence’s tenure as governor nearly destroyed his political career. He had promised Oesterle and other members of the state’s Republican business establishment that he would continue in the path of his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, a well-liked fiscal conservative who had called for a “truce” on divisive social issues. “Pence was very accommodating,” Oesterle said. But after he was elected he began taking controversial far-right stands that, critics believed, were geared more toward building his national profile than toward serving Indiana voters. At first, Pence highlighted fiscal conservatism. In 2013, he proposed cutting the state income tax. An internal report by Americans for Prosperity described the proposal as an example of the Kochs’ “model states” program “in action.” Indiana Republicans, who had majorities in both legislative chambers, initially balked at the tax cut, deeming it irresponsible. But Americans for Prosperity acted as a force multiplier for Pence, much as it is now promising to do for Trump’s proposed federal tax cuts. The group mounted an expensive campaign that included fifty rallies, two six-figure television-ad blitzes, and phone-bank calls and door-to-door advocacy in fifty-three of Indiana’s ninety-two counties. Eventually, the legislature went along with what Pence often describes as “the largest income-tax cut in the state’s history,” even though Indiana already had one of the lowest income taxes in the country, and had cut it only once before. Trump has recently described Pence’s record as a template for the White House’s tax plan, saying, “Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes.” But, in the view of Andrew Downs, the Indiana political scientist, “the tax cuts were fairly meaningless.” Residents earning fifty thousand dollars a year received a tax cut of about $3.50 per month. Pence claimed that the cut stimulated the economy, but John Zody, the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, told me, “Our per-capita income is thirty-eighth in the nation, and not climbing.” The state recently had to increase its gas tax by ten cents per gallon, to repair its crumbling infrastructure. In a few surprising instances, Pence veered from conservative orthodoxy. In 2014, he broke with many other Republican governors and agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana. He declared that his proposal was “the kind of health-care reform that puts working Hoosiers in the driver’s seat.” He was no fan of Obamacare: when it passed, he likened the blow to 9/11. Nevertheless, Pence negotiated with the Obama Administration and established waivers that made the expansion acceptable to him. Among other things, all Indiana residents were required to demonstrate “personal responsibility” by paying something toward the cost of their medical services. Critics argued that such measures were needlessly punitive toward poor residents. Americans for Prosperity, which objects to any form of government health care, gently reproached Pence for “meeting Washington’s demands.” But the Medicaid-expansion plan was, and remains, popular in the state. After this apostasy, Pence tilted back toward the right. At the last minute, he killed an application for an eighty-million-dollar federal grant to start a statewide preschool program. Education officials in Pence’s own administration favored the grant, but conservative opponents of secular public education had complained. When reporters asked Pence about his decision, he said only that the federal government had attached “too many strings.” But, as Matthew Tully, a columnist at the Indianapolis Star, wrote, “he could not name one.” Eventually, after widespread criticism, Pence reapplied for the grant. Tully concluded that Pence had a “fatal flaw”—he was “too political and ideological” to be a good governor. “His focus was on the next step up, not the job at hand,” Tully wrote. Political handicappers noticed that Pence was spending a lot of time taking trips to states with important Presidential primaries and mingling with big out-of-state donors. In the summer of 2014, Pence spoke at an Americans for Prosperity summit in Dallas. At the event, he stood by Short’s side and declared himself “grateful to have enjoyed” David Koch’s support. That fall, Pence reached out to Nick Ayers, a young, sharp-elbowed political consultant, to see if he would help him in a 2016 Presidential run. Nothing came of it, but Pence clearly had White House ambitions. In the spring of 2015, Pence signed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he presented as innocuous. “He said it protected religious freedom, and who’s against that?” Oesterle recalled. But then a photograph of the closed signing session surfaced. It showed Pence surrounded by monks and nuns, along with three of the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state. The image went viral. Indiana residents began examining the law more closely, and discovered that it essentially legalized discrimination against homosexuals by businesses in the state. “The No. 1 challenge we face in Indiana is the ability to attract and retain talented people,” Oesterle said. “If the state is seen as bigoted to certain members of the community, it makes the job monumentally harder.” The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Oesterle said, “was not an issue of Pence’s creation”—it had “gurgled out” of the far-right fringe of the Indiana legislature. But, he added, “there was a lack of leadership.” In his view, Pence should have prevented it and other extreme bills from moving forward. “You can see it happening in Washington now,” Oesterle said. “He’s not that effective a leader, or administrator. Extremists grabbed the initiative.” The outcry over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enormous. Gay-rights groups condemned the bill and urged boycotts of the state. Pete Buttigieg, the young gay mayor of South Bend, who is a rising figure in the Democratic Party, told me that he tried to talk to Pence about the legislation, which he felt would cause major economic damage to Indiana. “But he got this look in his eye,” Buttigieg recalled. “He just inhabits a different reality. It’s very difficult for him to lay aside the social agenda. He’s a zealot.” In an effort to quell criticism, Pence consented, against the advice of his staff, to be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday-morning show on ABC. Stephanopoulos asked him five times if it was now legal in Indiana for businesses to discriminate against homosexuals, and each time Pence was evasive. Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. “What killed him was his unwillingness to take a clear position,” Oesterle said. “You saw the conflict between his ideology and his ambition. If he’d just said, ‘Look, I think people should have the right to fire gay people,’ he would have been labelled a rigid ideologue, but he wouldn’t have been mocked.” Smulyan, the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. The hashtag #BoycottIndiana appeared on Twitter’s list of trending topics, and remained there for days. Alarmed business executives from many of the state’s most prominent companies, including Cummins, Eli Lilly, Salesforce, and Anthem, joined civic leaders in expressing disapproval. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. A headline in the Star, published the Tuesday after the Stephanopoulos interview, demanded, “fix this now.” Within days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. But he clearly had not anticipated the outrage he’d triggered, and then he had tried to save his career at the expense of his professed principles. Steve Deace, an influential conservative radio host, told me that Pence’s reversal was “almost the worst conservative betrayal I’ve witnessed in my career.” He added, “He had no chance at national office after that, other than getting on the Trump ticket.” Similarly, Michael Maurer, the owner of the Indianapolis Business Journal, who is a Republican but not a hard-line social conservative, said, “It just exploded in his face. His polls were terrible. I bet he’d never get elected again in Indiana. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. We’re still reeling!” Pence loyalists rushed in to help. Matt Lloyd, Pence’s former congressional staffer, left his communications job with Koch Industries to work with him in Indiana. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. But Pence’s mistake could not be airbrushed away. Lawn signs saying “Fire Pence!” began appearing across the state. “His tenure in Indiana was characterized by a lot of missteps,” Buttigieg said. “He was always decent to me, but over all there was a sense that every few months something got bungled. He’s definitely not the mastermind behind the curtain that some people suspect.” In 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. In a place like Scott County, Clere said, “typically you’d have no cases, or maybe one a year.” Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. (Pence’s campaign against Planned Parenthood had contributed to the closure of five clinics in the region; none had performed abortions, but all had offered H.I.V. testing.) That same year, the state health commissioner called Indiana’s H.I.V. outbreak a public-health emergency. Clere came of age during the aids crisis, and had read Randy Shilts’s best-selling account, “And the Band Played On.” He tried to get the legislature to study the possibility of legalizing a syringe exchange, which he felt “was a matter of life and death,” and could “save lives quickly and inexpensively.” But conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. “With Pence, you need to look at the framework, which is abstinence,” Clere said. “It’s the same as with giving teen-agers condoms. Conservatives think it promotes the behavior, even though it’s a scientifically proven harm-reduction strategy.” In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. Clere told me that he spent “every last dime of my political capital” to get the bill through. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. “I commend Representative Clere for the efforts to help the state deal with this,” Kevin Burke, the health officer in neighboring Clark County, told me. “But he paid a price for it.” Clere remains bitter about Pence. “It was all part of his pattern of political expediency,” he said. “He was stridently against it until it became politically expedient to support it.” Clere, a Christian who opposes abortion, told me that he now finds Pence’s piety hypocritical. “He says he’s ‘pro-life,’ ” Clere said. “But people were dying.” When Clere was asked whom he would rather have as President—Trump or Pence—he replied, “I’d take Trump every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.” Pence likes to say of himself, “I am a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.” But Clere is not alone in questioning Pence’s political purity. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. In the hope of reversing Pence’s ban, Joseph Tobin, the bishop of Indianapolis, requested a meeting. Tobin, who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Tobin is revered in the Catholic community of Indiana in which Pence grew up. “I really think he thought it over,” Tobin said. “There was some anguish.” But in the end Pence told him, “I need to protect the people of the state.” “I respect that,” Tobin replied. “But this isn’t a threat.” Pence didn’t change his mind. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. Eventually, federal courts struck down Pence’s executive order as discriminatory. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. After a pause, he quietly said, “No.” Pence has also been criticized for his treatment of Keith Cooper, a former resident of Elkhart, Indiana, who spent nine years in prison for an armed robbery that he didn’t commit. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. “He didn’t do a thing to help me,” Cooper told me. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. It was the first time in Indiana that a pardon was granted on the basis of innocence, rather than clemency. “It was all about Pence’s political career,” Cooper said. “As a Christian, he’s a hypocrite. He wouldn’t see me or speak with me. God doesn’t turn his back on the truth, but Pence just walked away from the truth. I couldn’t move forward in life. I was stuck in a dead-end job.” Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. “I forgive them,” he said. “They stood up for me.” He went on, “I forgive the prosecutor. He wrote a letter. And the parole board? They saw that justice happened. But I don’t forgive Mike Pence, and never will. He talks all this God stuff, but he’s biased. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. He didn’t want to be the first white man in Indiana to pardon an innocent black man.” A spokesman for Pence, who declined to be quoted, said Pence believed that Cooper needed to go back to court and face a retrial, instead of seeking a pardon. Pence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. In the spring of 2016, polls showed the two in a dead heat. The national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. Frustrated, Short quit his job at Freedom Partners and signed on to Marco Rubio’s campaign. The Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. The brain trust behind Trump’s Indiana campaign included people whose public images were very different from Pence’s. Among them were Roderick Ratcliff, the C.E.O. of Centaur Gaming, the state’s largest gaming-and-racetrack business, and Steve Hilbert, a flamboyant entrepreneur who had been a business partner of Trump’s. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. He is currently married to his sixth wife, and has denied reports that they met when she popped out of a cake, topless, at his stepson’s bachelor party. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. In 2013, when Hilbert needed cash, Trump bought Hilbert’s Caribbean estate, and Hilbert and Melania Trump made a deal to sell skin-care products. Despite Pence’s straitlaced reputation, he had closer ties with these figures than most people knew. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. The state’s gaming companies, including Centaur, routed donations to “soft money” groups like the Republican Governors Association, which then transferred the money to Pence and other candidates. Pence, meanwhile, used executive orders to quietly grant several of the gambling industry’s wishes, such as allowing riverboat casinos to expand onshore. In 2016, the largest donor to Pence’s gubernatorial campaign was the Republican Governors Association, and some of its major donors were casino companies. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. Nearly all this cash, and much more, was divided between just two gubernatorial races that year, one of which was Indiana’s. That spring, David Koch also invited Pence to be a featured guest at a fund-raiser at his Palm Beach mansion, attended by about seventy of the Republican Party’s biggest donors. Trump handily won the Indiana primary. Pence, who had tepidly endorsed Ted Cruz, switched to Trump. Pence’s history with Trump, however, was strained. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Trump brought up some gossip—the wife of Mitch Daniels, the outgoing governor of Indiana, had reportedly left him for another man, then reunited with her husband. According to the Times, Trump announced that he’d never take back a wife who had been unfaithful. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Trump gave Pence a small contribution, but the coarse New York billionaire and the prim Indiana evangelical appeared to be on different wavelengths. Nevertheless, in 2016, political insiders in Indiana began hearing that Pence would welcome a spot on the Trump ticket. “There was no doubt he’d say yes,” Tony Samuel, the vice-chair of the Trump campaign in the state, who was a lobbyist for Centaur and other companies, told me. Paul Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign chairman at that point, arranged for Trump to meet Pence, and urged Trump to pick him. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Kellyanne Conway, who had done polling work for the Kochs, pushed for Pence, too, as did Stephen Bannon, although private e-mails recently obtained by BuzzFeed indicate that he considered the choice a Faustian bargain—“an unfortunate necessity.” Still, Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. In 2004, the oil firm that Pence’s father had partly owned had filed for bankruptcy. Mike Pence’s shares of the company’s stock, which he had valued at up to a quarter of a million dollars, became worthless. In 2016, according to a campaign-finance disclosure form, Pence had one bank account, which held less than fifteen thousand dollars. But in July Pence found a way to please Trump when he played golf with him at Trump’s club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Recognizing that Trump was susceptible to flattery, he told the media that Trump “beat me like a drum.” Yet, in a phone conversation that I had with Trump during this period, he told me that he was torn about the choice. He noted repeatedly that Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, had been “loyal” to him. When I asked Trump if he shared Pence’s deeply conservative social views, he became uncharacteristically silent. Trump came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. Afterward, the Trump campaign informed him that the choice was down to him or Pence, so he needed to “get ready.” The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. A tire on Trump’s plane developed a flat, so he and his son Eric, who had accompanied him, decided to stay the night. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. (Samuel, who was at the restaurant, told me that Trump tipped the chef a couple hundred dollars.) At dawn on July 13th, Ivanka and Don, Jr., flew to Indianapolis to join their father for breakfast with the Pences at the governor’s mansion. The Times soon reported that Trump had asked Pence if he would accept the job, and that Pence had responded, “In a heartbeat.” But the next night, according to someone familiar with the details, Trump called Christie and said, “I’ve got a question for you. Are you ready?” “Ready for what?” Christie responded. “Ready to do this with me,” Trump said. “Are you offering?” Christie said. “I’m asking you—but you’ve got to make sure you’re ready,” Trump said. “I’m as tough as they come,” Christie said. “O.K.,” Trump said. “I’m making the decision tomorrow. Stay by your phone.” But Christie was left hanging for the next three days. He suspected that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had intervened and turned Trump against him, because years earlier, as a U.S. Attorney, he had prosecuted Kushner’s father for tax fraud and other crimes. Conway told me that this theory was wrong, but acknowledged, “It truly was a tie—almost a jump ball.” Hoping to break the tie, Christie’s detractors made the case that he was politically toxic because of the Bridgegate scandal, in which officials had caused traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in an act of reprisal against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey. Trump began leaning toward Pence. “I wouldn’t say Trump was pushed into it,” a top Trump campaign aide told me. “He was led into it. Pence was made the most palatable choice by those around him.” Before Pence’s trip to Bedminster, he had asked his brother Gregory to meet him at a Burger King. “He said, ‘Donald Trump wants to talk to me,’ ” Gregory recalled. They both knew what it was about. “I told him, ‘You have to go, you have no choice,’ ” Gregory said. As he saw it, his brother also had no choice about saying yes, if picked: “When your party’s nominee asks you to be the running mate, you have to do it.” But it was a gamble. As Gregory put it to me, “If he lost, he had no money, and he had three kids in college. He took out student loans for the kids. He’s got a retirement account, but I was afraid he’d run out of money in just a couple of weeks. He’d have to get a job. He was rolling the dice.” Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. “The one thing you could count on with Pence was interpersonal decency, which made it strange that he joined the Trump ticket, the most indecent ticket any party’s ever put together,” Pete Buttigieg said. “But, really, he had nowhere else to go. His chances of getting reëlected were fifty-fifty at best.” By July 14th, Trump’s aides had leaked that he was about to pick Pence, who had flown to New York for the announcement. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. The next morning, Trump called Christie and said, “They’re telling me I have to pick him. It’s central casting. He looks like a Vice-President.” A few hours later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate. Several days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. “Isn’t he just perfect?” Trump asked Gingrich. “Straight from central casting.” The awkwardness between Pence and Trump didn’t entirely dissipate. When the “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced, revealing Trump’s boast about grabbing women “by the pussy,” Karen Pence was horrified. According to a former campaign aide, Pence refused to take Trump’s calls and sent him a letter saying that he and Karen, as Christians, were deeply offended by his actions and needed to make an “assessment” about whether to remain with the campaign. They urged Trump to pray. When Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had “huge problems” with his behavior. But in public Pence was forgiving, saying, “I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.” (A Pence spokesman has denied that there was any friction over the incident.) Pence exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. “He did an amazing job,” Bannon said. “Lots of conservative groups had questions about Trump. He answered those questions.” The Kochs were delighted that one of their favorite politicians had joined the ticket, although, because of Trump’s stance against wealthy donors, Pence and the Kochs agreed to cancel a speech that he had been scheduled to give at their donor summit that August. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. Some billionaires in the Kochs’ donor network—such as the hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, who has also financed Bannon’s ventures—began backing Trump. The Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. Trump had promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, but he had no experience governing, and few political contacts. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. Christie’s team had been quietly gathering résumés and making plans for months, but Pence’s team threw out the research, dumping thirty binders of material into the trash. “Donald Trump ran against the establishment, but there was a vacuum,” a member of the earlier transition team said. “Movement conservatives jumped in. There was strong think-tank participation from Heritage and others who saw the opportunity.” Trump began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt, in turn, placed Patrick Traylor, a lawyer for Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies, in charge of the E.P.A.’s enforcement of key anti-pollution laws. As the Times has reported, a document called “A Roadmap to Repeal,” written by Koch operatives, has guided the E.P.A.’s reversal of Obama Administration clean-air and climate regulations. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. Betsy DeVos, a billionaire heiress, who had been a major member of the Kochs’ donor network and a supporter of Pence, was named Secretary of Education. The new director of the C.I.A. was Mike Pompeo, the congressman who represented Charles Koch’s district, in Wichita, Kansas; before Pompeo ran for office, the Kochs had invested in his aerospace business. Pompeo, the former transition-team member said, “wasn’t even on Trump’s radar, but he was brought in to meet him and got appointed, like, the next day.” A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. The pattern continued among lower-level political appointees, including in Pence’s office, which was stocked with Koch alumni. Pence reportedly consulted with Charles Koch before hiring his speechwriter, Stephen Ford, who previously worked at Freedom Partners. Senator Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, believes that the Kochs “will stick one hundred of their own people into the government—and Trump will never notice.” As a result, he said, “the signs of a rapprochement are everywhere.” Whitehouse continued, “One by one, all the things that Trump campaigned on that annoyed the Koch brothers are being thrown overboard. And one by one the Koch brothers’ priorities are moving up the list.” Trump’s populist, nationalist agenda has largely been replaced by the agenda of the corporate right. Trump has made little effort at infrastructure reform, and he abandoned his support for a “border-adjustment tax” after the Koch network spent months campaigning against it, and after Pence and Short discussed it privately with Charles Koch at a meeting in Colorado Springs this summer. Bannon’s proposal to create a higher tax bracket for citizens earning upward of five million dollars was dropped. The Kochs enthusiastically support the White House’s proposed tax-cut package, which, according to most nonpartisan analyses, will disproportionately benefit the super-rich. (The proposed elimination of the estate tax alone would give the Koch brothers’ heirs a windfall of billions of dollars.) Americans for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. “They’re aligned on tax reform,” Bannon said. “The Kochs are a hundred per cent with you, so long as it means cutting taxes for the Kochs. Anything that will help the middle-class people? Forget it.” Another consequence of Trump’s choice for Vice-President may be the widening federal investigation into possible connections between his campaign and the Russian government. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. Flynn, whom Obama had fired as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was not on any of the original transition team’s long lists for government appointments. Christie considered him too risky. On November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. “Gentlemen, can I help you?” Christie asked. Ivanka Trump, who was a member of the transition team’s executive council, announced that she had invited them. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. Praising Flynn’s “amazing loyalty to my father,” she turned to him and asked, “General, what job do you want?” A participant at the meeting said, “It was like Princess Ivanka had laid the sword on Flynn’s shoulders and said, ‘Rise and go forth.’ ” (A source close to Ivanka didn’t deny the account, but said that it exaggerated her role, and that she was merely trying to show appreciation for Flynn’s support.) Flynn expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. Flynn said that he could probably get a congressional waiver, but if not he’d settle for national-security adviser. A few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. On November 17th, after little vetting, Flynn was named Trump’s national-security adviser, one of the most sensitive posts in the U.S. government. There is no indication that Pence raised any objections about Flynn to Trump, even after Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Pence a letter warning him about Flynn’s questionable ethics: Flynn had failed to disclose that, during the campaign, he had done paid lobbying work for Turkish interests. A member of the original transition team told me, “Pence left his backbone in Indiana, if he ever had one.” When reporters later asked Pence why he hadn’t heeded Cummings’s letter, he said that he’d never seen it. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. “Either he read it and ignored our warnings or someone on his team did so,” Cummings told me. “Either way, the outcome was horrendous, because President Trump should never have given General Flynn access to our nation’s most sensitive and classified information.” It undoubtedly would have cost Pence to take a political stand against the worst instincts of Trump and his family. But had Pence stopped Flynn’s appointment Trump might not have become the object of a sprawling special investigation. Phil Sharp, the former Indiana representative, said, “There’s a leadership test here. There are real issues, and a failure to do something he was legally, ethically, and politically responsible for.” Sharp added, “It also failed the basic Washington litmus test of self-preservation.” Pence soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. But then the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department had wiretaps of Flynn doing just that. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. On February 13th, Trump fired Flynn, ostensibly for deceiving Pence, who looked like either a liar or a chump. Three months later, Trump fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who had opened the federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russian ties. Pence declared that Comey’s firing had nothing to do with Trump’s displeasure at the Russia investigation. Trump, he said, had merely followed the Justice Department’s recommendation. But Trump contradicted Pence within hours, telling NBC’s Lester Holt that his anger over the Russia probe led him to dismiss Comey. Further damaging Pence’s credibility, the Times revealed that, before Comey’s dismissal, Pence had attended a White House meeting where Trump discussed his intention to fire Comey and devised a plan to get the Justice Department to support the move. Several law professors have argued that the Vice-President could be vulnerable to charges of obstructing justice, or “misprision of a felony,” for participating in a meeting about shutting down the federal investigation and then providing a false cover story to the public. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, tweeted, “The VP appears to me to be in what we lawyers have been known to call deep doo-doo.” Unlike most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. He’s continued to serve as the key contact for conservative groups and campaign donors, and he has tried to help Trump contend with Congress. But Pence was publicly humiliated in July when John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, stood on the floor of the Senate, where Pence had been pleading for his vote, and gave a thumbs-down, killing Trump’s health-care plan. White House officials had miscalculated, believing that McCain was on their side. “What’s Pence doing?” Walter Mondale, who served as Vice-President to Jimmy Carter, asked me recently. “I ask myself that every day.” Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Subsequent Vice-Presidents have inherited these upgrades, but Mondale felt that all Pence was doing was “trying not to make an enemy of the President.” Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Dan Quayle, who was Vice-President in George H. W. Bush’s Administration, praised Pence, whom he has known for many years, for fulfilling the two major duties of a Vice-President: to be supportive and to be prepared. But when I asked Quayle if President Bush had ever asked him to leave the room—as Trump reportedly asked Pence to do, so that he could privately ask Comey to ease up on Flynn—he said, “Never.” Mark Knoller, who has covered the White House for CBS since Gerald Ford’s Presidency, said of Pence, “He’s the most publicly deferential to his President of any V.P. I can remember.” At Trump’s first full Cabinet meeting, Pence said, “This is the greatest privilege of my life, to serve as Vice-President to a President who’s keeping his word to the American people.” Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. (Pence’s trip reportedly cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.) In private, however, Pence has become a back channel for government figures who are frustrated by the impulsiveness and inattention of a President who won’t read more than a page or two of bullet points. Erick Erickson, a conservative commentator who admires Pence, told me, “Everyone knows that Mike Pence can get the job done, and the President can’t, but no one can say it.” According to NBC, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently became so enraged by the President’s incompetence that he called him “a fucking moron” in front of others, and threatened to quit. In an effort to calm Tillerson, and prevent yet another high-level resignation, Pence reportedly “counselled” the Secretary of State on how to manage Trump, suggesting that he criticize him only privately. “Trump thinks Pence is great,” Bannon told me. But, according to a longtime associate, Trump also likes to “let Pence know who’s boss.” A staff member from Trump’s campaign recalls him mocking Pence’s religiosity. He said that, when people met with Trump after stopping by Pence’s office, Trump would ask them, “Did Mike make you pray?” Two sources also recalled Trump needling Pence about his views on abortion and homosexuality. During a meeting with a legal scholar, Trump belittled Pence’s determination to overturn Roe v. Wade. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. “You see?” Trump asked Pence. “You’ve wasted all this time and energy on it, and it’s not going to end abortion anyway.” When the conversation turned to gay rights, Trump motioned toward Pence and joked, “Don’t ask that guy—he wants to hang them all!” There have been other evangelical Christians in the White House, including Carter and George W. Bush, but Pence’s fundamentalism exceeds theirs. In 2002, he declared that “educators around America must teach evolution not as fact but as theory,” alongside such theories as intelligent design, which argues that life on Earth is too complex to have emerged through random mutation. Pence has described intelligent design as the only “remotely rational explanation for the known universe.” At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. In 2004, Drollinger, whose organization, Capitol Ministries, specializes in proselytizing to elected officials, stirred protests from female legislators in California, where he was then preaching, after he wrote, “Women with children at home, who either serve in public office, or are employed on the outside, pursue a path that contradicts God’s revealed design for them. It is a sin.” Drollinger describes Catholicism as “a false religion,” calls homosexuality “a sin,” and believes that a wife must “submit” to her husband. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In a recent interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Drollinger said that Pence “has uncompromising Biblical tenacity” and “brings real value to the head of the nation.” Many Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. From a purely partisan viewpoint, Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic operative, argues that—putting aside the fear that Trump might start a nuclear war—“Democrats should hope Trump stays in office,” because he makes a better foil, and because Pence might work more effectively with Congress and be more successful at advancing the far right’s agenda. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so. “I think he’s the most likely Republican nominee in 2024,” he said. Ron Klain, who was chief of staff to the former Vice-President Joe Biden, is skeptical of this, given Trump’s accumulating baggage. “There is no success for Mike Pence unless Trump works—he cannot run far enough or fast enough to not get hit by the falling tree,” Klain said. “But he may think he can.” Evidently, the next chapter is on Pence’s mind. Over the fireplace in the Vice-President’s residence, he has hung a plaque with a passage from the Bible: “ ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the lord, ‘Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’ ” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated the date, in October, 2017, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors.

Trump’s Health-Care Threats Are Nothing But Spite and Fury,6024,"In the past few days, senior Senate Republicans have made it clear that they want to move on from Obamacare repeal. “We’ve had our vote, and we’re moving on to tax reform,” Senator John Thune, a close ally of Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, said on Monday. When McConnell himself laid out his plans for the final two weeks of this congressional session, he didn’t mention health care. But one Republican leader—Donald Trump—is still refusing to accept defeat. On Saturday, the President demanded that the Senate vote again on health care, and on Monday he repeated his threat to sabotage the Obamacare insurance exchanges. With right-wing pressure groups, including the Koch brothers’ political network, egging him on, Trump is mulling whether to withhold the payments that the federal government makes to insurers in order to reduce the out-of-pocket costs that low-income policyholders face. If Trump stops the payments, which are known as cost-sharing reductions, or C.S.R.s, it would be an incredibly petty and spiteful move, with an enormous and serious human cost. By Washington standards, the sums of money involved are small: seven billion dollars this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But to those households that benefit from the C.S.R.s, the impact of stopping them would be dramatic. As anyone who has purchased insurance on an Obamacare exchange knows, the policies often come with sky-high deductibles. According to the health-information Web site HealthPocket.com, the average deductible for a “silver”-level plan is now more than thirty-five hundred dollars for individuals, and more than seven thousand dollars for families. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures The C.S.R.s are designed to reduce the burden of these costs for those Americans least able to afford them. The payments enable insurers to dramatically reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for policy purchasers who earn less than two and a half times the poverty line. (For individuals, the income eligibility threshold is about thirty thousand dollars a year. For a family of four, it is about sixty thousand dollars.) Instead of facing deductibles that can run into many thousands of dollars, these purchasers end up paying very little because the federal government bears the cost. Trump and some other Republicans routinely describe the C.S.R.s as a “bailout” for the insurers. But the actual beneficiaries are American households of modest means. Should the payments be stopped, these people would suffer the consequences—as would countless others who don’t benefit from the C.S.R.s directly. That’s because some insurers would choose to exit certain markets, and those that remained would raise their prices. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that monthly premiums would rise by nineteen per cent, on average, and that in some states—including several that voted for Trump—they would rise even higher than that. Premiums would go up twenty-three per cent in Alabama, twenty-five per cent in Florida, and twenty-seven per cent in Mississippi. It might seem unthinkable for a President to treat his citizens as political pawns in this way, and some Republicans are urging Trump not to do so. “Without payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans will be hurt,” Senator Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, said on Tuesday. Alexander also confirmed that his committee would hold public hearings in September on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets. That would represent a return to the traditional way of making policy on Capitol Hill: call in outside experts, involve the other party, and try to reach a bipartisan agreement. But Trump, despite the stinging setback he suffered last week, doesn’t seem interested in going down this route. If he decides to stop the C.S.R. payments, he can expect not just another political storm but a new contentious legal fight. The issue of whether the White House has the right to authorize these types of payments has been the subject of a bitter court battle for years, and on Tuesday a federal appeals court allowed a group of Democratic state attorneys general to intervene in the case and defend the C.S.R.s. “If Donald Trump won’t defend these vital subsidies for American families, then we will,” Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, said in response to the ruling. Other than sating his desire for vengeance, it’s hard to see what Trump would get out of committing to this confrontation. Stopping the C.S.R.s wouldn’t persuade Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, or John McCain—the three senators who blocked the Senate Republicans’ repeal effort last week—to change their minds. And it would only further sour relations with the Democrats, whose help the White House will need if it wants to pursue other aspects of Trump’s agenda, such as introducing permanent tax cuts and launching a big infrastructure program. Perhaps John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, who over the weekend placed courtesy calls to the Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, will talk Trump out of it. We shall see.

The Republican Health-Care Meltdown,6191,"If the Republican Party’s crusade to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is truly over, Monday night provided a fittingly sudden and chaotic ending. Early in the evening, two conservative Republican senators—Mike Lee, of Utah, and Jerry Moran, of Kansas—issued statements saying that they wouldn’t support the revised health-care-reform bill that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, released last Thursday. Since the Republicans have a majority of just two in the Senate, and two other Republicans—Susan Collins, of Maine, and Rand Paul, of Kentucky—had already announced that they wouldn’t vote for the legislation, the effort to secure its passage looked lost. For several hours after Lee and Moran’s announcements, McConnell issued no public response. Then, around 11 p.m., he released a statement that said, “Regretfully, it’s now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful.” But McConnell didn’t leave it at that. Instead, he said that the Senate Republicans would now move to vote on repealing the A.C.A. immediately and dealing with the consequences later. Since those consequences would include causing turmoil in the private markets and reversing the Medicaid expansion that has provided health-insurance coverage to about fourteen million Americans, it seems very unlikely that McConnell will be able to get fifty votes to pass such an irresponsible piece of legislation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether McConnell really believes such a reckless strategy is feasible, or whether he was simply looking to save face. President Trump, however, supports pursuing repeal without replacement. On Monday night, he tweeted, “Republicans should just repeal failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!” That final sentence was almost certainly wishful thinking. And the entire statement was consistent with the lack of gravity, inattention to detail, and political gamesmanship that has characterized the Republican effort to undo Obamacare since the beginning. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? The larger lesson of this sorry episode is that nobody—not McConnell, or Trump, or House Speaker Paul Ryan—can resolve the contradictions of today’s Republican Party. Once the political arm of the Rotary Club and the affluent suburbs, the Party is increasingly one of middle-class and working-class voters, many of whom are big beneficiaries of federal programs, such as Medicaid and the Obamacare subsidies for the purchase of private insurance. But the G.O.P. remains beholden to its richest, most conservative donors, many of whom espouse a doctrine of rolling back the government and cutting taxes, especially taxes applicable to themselves and other very rich people. It was the donors and ideologues, with Ryan as their front man, who led the assault on the Affordable Care Act. These efforts had put several senators in a difficult place. Moran, who was first elected in 2010 and has a solidly conservative voting record, found himself being forced to defend a set of reforms to Medicaid that meant potentially closing many rural hospitals and taking health-care coverage away from more than a hundred thousand of his fellow-Kansans, according to the Urban Institute. Although Moran cast his decision not to support the revised bill in terms of needing more time for consultations and legislative deliberations, it was clear that he was feeling the political pressure. In their statements on Monday night, both Moran and Lee said that the revised bill didn’t go far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act and reducing premiums. This, despite the fact that the measure contained an amendment—modelled on a proposal by Lee—that would have allowed insurers to offer cheap, catastrophic care policies outside the Obamacare insurance exchanges, so long as they also offered a comprehensive option through the exchanges. In recent days, insurers warned that the amendment was completely unworkable and could lead to the collapse of the exchanges. How much further does Lee want to go? In his statement, he also referred to the bill’s failure to abolish all the taxes that the A.C.A. introduced—taxes that only hit the donor class. In other words, the bill didn’t do enough for the wealthy. Moran, for his part, said, “We must now start fresh with an open legislative process to develop innovative solutions that provide greater personal choice, protections for pre-existing conditions, increased access and lower overall costs for Kansans.” But in order to enable people with preëxisting conditions or modest incomes to obtain health coverage at a reasonable cost, you have to restrict the choices of others. The young and the healthy have to be persuaded, or forced, to join the same risk pools as older and sicker people. Insurers have to be prevented from creaming off low-risk customers into separate markets. Rich people have to be taxed to pay for Medicaid, or for the subsidies that enable working families on modest incomes to buy private insurance. As Milton Friedman noted long ago, there is no free lunch. Obamacare, for all its complexity and teething problems, was, and is, a serious and comprehensive effort to face up to these difficulties and trade-offs. The Republicans never got serious about how to replace it. They are now paying the price. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

What Texas Tells Us About the Latest Threats to Women’s Health Care,9887,"Among the various chances that congressional Republicans have taken in their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, one of the riskier moves involves the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood. In both the House and the Senate, replacement legislation has included a provision that would cut off all federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. (The bill would also bar federal tax credits from being used to purchase private health plans that cover abortion.) The provision is reportedly included even in the so-called skinny repeal. The Senate parliamentarian has determined that the provision violates the Byrd rule, which states that a reconciliation bill can only address matters that affect the federal budget; if the anti-Planned Parenthood provision cannot be passed under reconciliation, it would require sixty votes to pass. Many observers expect Senate Republicans to rework the language in the bill so that it can stay in reconciliation. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, has suggested that the parliamentarian’s ruling can be ignored. That Republicans have taken things this far is a testimony to just how important defunding Planned Parenthood has become to many of them. Planned Parenthood operates more than six hundred clinics across the country, and a majority of its patients have incomes that fall near or below the federal poverty level; the organization receives around forty per cent of its revenue from federal funding, mostly through Medicaid. Cutting off those payments would be a drastic change for women’s health care in this country. For a glimpse of just how drastic it would be, we can look to Texas, where state legislators have been systematically defunding and handicapping Planned Parenthood for years. Currently, the Texas legislature is in special session, and three more anti-abortion measures have already been passed. One of them prevents local and state government agencies from contracting in any way—including via lease agreements—with clinics that are affiliated with abortion providers. As with the federal provision attached to the repeal of Obamacare, Planned Parenthood is not mentioned by name in this Texas bill. And yet, as Texas senators acknowledged last Friday, the bill only affects Planned Parenthood. (Calls to multiple state senators who sponsored the bill were not returned.) The campaign against Planned Parenthood in Texas kicked off in 2011, a point when, as Lawrence Wright noted recently in the magazine, the organization was serving sixty per cent of the health needs of low-income women in the state. In the 2011 legislative session, which Texas Monthly called “the most aggressively anti-abortion and anti-contraception session in history,” the state government cut family-planning spending by two-thirds and approved a budget that, starting in 2013, banned Planned Parenthood from participating in the state’s women’s-health program, now called Healthy Texas Women. Federal law requires that states allow Medicaid patients their choice of “any willing provider,” and so Texas had to give up a nine-to-one federal funding match. Millions of dollars in spending for women’s health care were turned away. Then, this past May, Texas asked the Trump Administration for that federal funding back—a request that, if approved, would signal to other states that Planned Parenthood can be banned from Medicaid family-planning programs at will and with no financial repercussions. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, sixteen additional states have already proposed or approved similar bans. It’s possible that, even if Planned Parenthood is defunded at the federal level by current Republican efforts, funding might be restored by subsequent legislation. But Texas provides a startling example of how quickly the women’s-health landscape can be wrecked by a withdrawal of resources—and how lasting that wreckage can be. Within months of the family-planning budget getting slashed in Texas, more than sixty women’s-health clinics had closed. Such effects can take years to undo, even if laws are reversed. In 2016, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that had halved the number of abortion clinics in the state. Only two clinics have reopened. The sprawl of Texas is almost incomprehensible—it’s the same distance from Houston, my home town, to El Paso as it is from Houston to Kansas City—and that sprawl means that rural clinic closures bring immediate and catastrophic consequences for poor women and women without cars. Teen abortions and teen births have both been increasing in Texas since 2011, and the maternal mortality rate in Texas doubled from 2010 to 2014. It’s now 35.8 deaths per hundred thousand live births—the worst maternal mortality rate you can find in the developed world. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Immigrants Deported to Death and Violence Last week, I spoke to Caroline Coyner-Such, a clinician who has been working in health care for forty-three years, twenty-seven of those at Planned Parenthood. She now works at a clinic in North Austin, one of three in the Austin area that collectively serve nearly nineteen thousand patients each year. “Twenty or thirty years ago,” she told me over the phone, “we saw mainly women under the age of thirty-five. These days, as Texas women lose access to other options, we’re seeing more women, and a wider range of women—preteens up to women in their fifties and sixties.” The previous day, a homeless patient had come in. The North Austin clinic provides well-woman exams, S.T.I. screenings, cervical-cancer screenings, breast-cancer screenings, and birth-control counselling, among other things. It does not provide abortion services, but the surgical center at the South Austin location, thirty minutes away, does. As clinics in other areas have been forced to close, the Austin-area clinics have begun seeing more and more patients from farther away. “Yesterday, I saw a patient from Elgin, which is an hour away,” Coyner-Such said. “We see people from Killeen, which is another hour away. This means people have to take a whole day off from work to drive to Austin to get basic services—which often used to be available in their communities—and go back. We routinely send prescriptions out in a seventy-five-to-one-hundred-mile radius.” The Austin-area clinics have a base of private donors and local grants that they’ve been able to draw from as they’ve scrambled to replace public funding; small clinics often lack this piecemeal buffer, and rely more heavily on Title X, which is Planned Parenthood’s other federal funding source. “People are fearful,” Coyner-Such told me. “The summer is usually lower in terms of patient numbers, but not this year.” The news is a constant presence in her workplace, she said, with patients showing up afraid that their insurance will be taken away, and with new regulations from the legislature rolling in. “We have to be constantly monitoring in order to know what we’re going to lose and what we have to recoup,” she said. “It takes a lot of effort to stay on top of—I can’t believe I’m even using this term, but—the fake news.” Patients are sometimes openly surprised that the clinic is clean and professional, or that Coyner-Such has specialty certifications. She knows the kind of campaigning she’s up against. “Years ago, I had a Planned Parenthood bumper sticker, and someone slashed my tires,” she said. “After that, I quit doing bumper stickers—it’s not worth the tire replacement.” The Republican health-care legislation asks that the landscape of women’s care be reimagined without Planned Parenthood in it. But without Planned Parenthood that landscape, particularly for low-income women, scarcely exists. Pink billboards have gone up around Austin and other major cities in Texas advertising the Healthy Texas Women program, which does not provide abortion services and is explicitly intended to redirect patients from Planned Parenthood, yet sixty thousand fewer women are enrolled in the program than were enrolled in the Medicaid Women’s Health Program in 2011, before Planned Parenthood was excluded. Even setting aside the fact that comprehensive women’s health care necessitates the option of safe abortion—and that the Hyde Amendment has banned federal funding of abortion, with rare exceptions, since 1976—Planned Parenthood serves such a large portion of low-income women, and has done so for so long, that other clinics are logistically incapable of picking up the slack. “There is a real fear, if Texas continues along this line, if they continue to downgrade our funding—where will these women go?” Coyner-Such said. “Will they wait six months for an appointment at another clinic? Or will they be pregnant because they aren’t able to access our services?” Then she excused herself, going back to the patients who awaited her.

The Strange Defense of Martin Shkreli,0,
Why So Many Republicans Still Grovel to Trump,7636,"Donald Trump is the first President in history to have a Cabinet meeting go viral. If you haven’t seen it yet, you must watch the video of Trump going around the table on Monday morning and eliciting gushing testimonials and expressions of loyalty from his own appointees. Mike Pence set the tone, saying, “The greatest privilege of my life is to serve as Vice-President to a President who is keeping his word to the American people, assembling a team that is bringing real change, real prosperity, real strength back to our nation.” Elaine Chao, the Transportation Secretary, thanked Trump for “getting the country moving again.” Sonny Perdue, the Agriculture Secretary, assured the President, “I just back got from Mississippi: they love you there.” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, described working for Trump as “great honor.” And Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, thanked the President for “the opportunity and the blessing that you have given us to serve your agenda and the American people.” So it went—part North Korean Politburo rah-rah session and part opening scene from “The Godfather.” A willingness to genuflect before a thin-skinned egomaniac is the price of serving in—or working closely with—this Administration. But why are so many powerful people willing to pay this price? In his remarks on Monday, Priebus, the former head of the Republican National Committee, offered a clue to the answer. Priebus’s use of the word “blessing” rightly earned him some ridicule, but his assurance to Trump that the machinery of government was working to further “your agenda” was much more significant. Clearly, Priebus and his fellow-Republicans want Trump to believe that the agenda being advanced in Washington today is his, and for the President’s supporters to believe this, too. But that’s not necessarily accurate. In Trump’s campaign speeches, his biggest applause lines came when he promised to prevent people from Muslim countries from entering the United States, when he pledged to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and when he advocated protectionist measures to save American jobs. Trump generated support and momentum for his campaign by offering voters an inflammatory brew of Islamophobia and economic nationalism. Today, however, this agenda is largely stalled. The courts have rejected the anti-Muslim travel ban, and Congress has rejected the wall. Meanwhile, Trump himself has embraced the Saudi Arabian monarchy, which helped popularize Islamist extremism, and has backed off from his threats to withdraw from nafta and impose hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and China. In the place of Trumpism, the Trump Administration is promoting and facilitating a much less popular agenda, which will end up hurting many Trump voters: the anti-government agenda of post-Reagan Republicanism. Controversial policies that conservatives have wanted to introduce for years are making their way through legislative and administrative processes. To be sure, the progress has been uneven, and the Trump Administration still hasn’t passed a landmark piece of legislation. But look closely. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold In the Senate, a group of Republicans is quietly working on a health-care bill that, it seems, will largely mimic the toxic American Health Care Act, which the House of Representatives passed last month. (Under the A.H.C.A., subsidies for purchasing health insurance would be reduced; premiums would go up, especially for the sick and elderly; and Medicaid would be slashed.) Just as radical as the contents of the bill is the way that it is being developed in utter secrecy. Evidently, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, intends to keep it under wraps until a few days before he forces a floor vote, which was the same tactic that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, used in the lower chamber. If things go according to plan, there will be no committee hearings, no input from outside groups, and no independent scoring of the bill from the Congressional Budget Office. House Republicans, meanwhile, passed the Financial choice Act, last week, which takes aim at the Dodd-Frank financial-reform act of 2010. The House bill would eliminate or weaken many elements of Dodd-Frank, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which helped uncover that Wells Fargo was ripping off many of its customers. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to crack down on Wall Street. But, after the election, he quickly abandoned that promise. On Monday, the Treasury Department issued a report on financial regulation that endorsed loosening many of the post-financial-crisis restrictions that banks face. Legislation is only part of the story. On the Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch is already demonstrating why the Heritage Foundation and other right-wing groups were so giddy about his nomination. And, at regulatory institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board, Trump has appointed, or is in the process of appointing, officials who hew to the lines laid down by conservative think tanks and their corporate donors. About the only areas that Trump has ruled off-limits are Social Security and Medicare. And even here Republicans are exploiting his ignorance, or lack of interest, in order to make cuts. Enacting the American Health Care Act would deplete the Medicare Trust Fund. And Trump’s own budget would cut disability-insurance benefits, which are part of the Social Security system. Trump isn’t merely enabling the Republican right; with his daily pratfalls and incendiary statements, he is also drawing attention away from the Party’s policy initiatives. Imagine for a moment if a more normal Republican—a Marco Rubio or a Jeb Bush or a John Kasich—were in the White House. With no James Comey, Robert Mueller, or Jeff Sessions to chew on, the news networks would surely be focussing on health-care reform and the scandalous manner in which the G.O.P. is trying to ram through a piece of legislation that would affect a sixth of the American economy and cause tens of millions of Americans to lose their insurance. Back in the nineteen-seventies, Lord Hailsham, an eminent British jurist, popularized a term for this type of behavior: elective dictatorship. He applied it to the British system, in which a government that has a healthy majority in Parliament can ride roughshod over the opposition. With Trump in the White House and the Republicans running Capitol Hill, elective dictatorship appears to have crossed the Atlantic. Small wonder, then, that so many Republicans are willing to kiss Trump’s ring. He’s given the G.O.P. what it has long wanted: a White House willing to go along with its reactionary agenda, and a President who provides it with political cover. As long as Trump sticks to his side of the deal, he can expect to receive the loyalty he so prizes. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Six Reasons Why the Trump Reset Won’t Work,9838,"The latest Trump Administration reset has begun, or so we are being asked to believe. On Tuesday, Mike Dubke, the White House communications director, confirmed that he was leaving his job after just three months. There is also talk of the Administration setting up a “war room” to deal with the Russia scandal, and assembling an all-star legal team to defend President Trump. Names like Ted Olson and Paul Clement, two former Solicitors General, are being bandied about. And rumors continue to circulate about who else will be coming or going. The potential exit of Sean Spicer, the White House spokesperson, has been the subject of whispers for weeks. According to Politico, on Monday Trump met with his former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie. What does it all amount to? Unless someone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue can find a magic potion capable of changing the President’s character and behavior, nothing much. To put it in business terms, the White House’s problem can’t be resolved by firing the marketing team and hiring some external consultants. The problem is the obvious shortcomings of the primary product, Donald J. Trump. Here are six of them: 1. He isn’t Presidential.
Even in an era of hyper-partisanship, the Presidency retains an aura that can lift up the person occupying it. During the first part of his trip to the Middle East and Europe last week, Trump largely stuck to his prepared script, stayed off Twitter, and let the Presidency work for him. As pictures of him being fêted in foreign lands were beamed back home, his approval rating rose five points, according to Gallup. But Trump couldn’t see the trip through without a blowup. When he got to Brussels, he berated his fellow nato leaders in public. Then he attacked the Germans, saying they were “bad, really bad” for exporting so many cars to the United States. After he arrived back home, this weekend, he quickly got back on Twitter and wailed away at his usual targets: the leakers, the media, and the Democrats. (For good measure, he also criticized Germany again.) It was almost as if he were sending a message to the members of his own staff who were suggesting that he might rein in his social-media presence. 2. He has limited bandwidth.
And that’s putting it nicely. Presidents don’t need to have Ph.D.s. They do need to be able to ingest a lot of information, focus on particular issues, and learn new things. In public, at least, Trump’s advisers insist that he can do this. ”He came here to learn,” Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council, said at the G7 summit, in Italy last week. “He came here to get smarter.” Why, then, did Trump launch his diatribe against the Germans on the eve of the G7 summit? On top of coming across as a boorish guest, he displayed his ignorance on trade—one of his signature issues. Evidently, he was oblivious to the fact that BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen have all set up factories in the United States, where they assemble many of the vehicles they sell here. Was Trump briefed on the structure of the global auto industry before he spoke? It might not have made much difference. According to a report in Tuesday’s Washington Post, his attention span is so short that intelligence briefers are encouraged to keep written presentations to a page and to include a lot of visual aids, such as maps, charts, and photographs. Reuters reported earlier this month that some National Security Council officials, when preparing materials for the President’s review, have strategically included Trump’s name in “as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if he’s mentioned.” 3. He won’t (or can’t) stick to a message.
The most dramatic example of this came after the James Comey firing, when Trump contradicted the White House’s official version of events, which was that the President had merely endorsed a proposal to get rid of the F.B.I. director that had come from Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General. That departure from script wasn’t a one-off: Trump does it all the time. On Sunday evening, he tweeted, “I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!” But just a few weeks ago, Trump held a celebration in the Rose Garden to mark the passage in the House of the American Health Care Act, which would cut health-care spending by $1.1 trillion over ten years. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Unless Trump can somehow be persuaded to be more consistent, it doesn’t matter who holds the positions of White House spokesman and director of communications. They will both have to spend most of their time trying to repair the damage that their boss inflicts on his own message. 4. He won’t delegate real authority.
All Administrations have rival factions, but most Presidents empower someone—their chief of staff, usually—to enforce discipline. In the Reagan Administration, for example, James Baker acted as the hammer. When David Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, was identified as the source of an embarrassing story about the Administration’s economic policies, Baker ordered him to have lunch with the President and grovel. In his memoir, “The Triumph of Politics,” Stockman recalled Baker telling him, “The menu is humble pie. You’re going to eat every last mother f’ing spoonful of it. You’re going to be the most contrite sonofabitch this world has ever seen.” The only thing that’s clear about the power structure in the current White House is that Trump is in charge. Rather than empowering Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, Trump mocks him as “Reince-y” in front of other aides and openly encourages internal rivalries. Nobody is safe from the President’s jabs, not even Jared Kushner, his son-in-law. “It has been duly noted in the White House that Mr. Trump, who feels that he has been ill served by his staff, has increasingly included Mr. Kushner when he dresses down aides and officials, a rarity earlier in his administration and during the campaign,” the Times reported a couple of days ago. 5. The Russian saga is now a morass.
In firing Comey, Trump transformed a troublesome story that was causing him great irritation into a potential constitutional crisis. The appointment of Robert Mueller as a special counsel gave him another chance to pull back, but he failed to take it. With Mueller in place, Trump could conceivably have changed tack. Rather than consistently belittling the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation, he could have said that he understood why many Americans have serious concerns about Moscow’s involvement in the 2016 election. He could have said that he had nothing to hide and that he welcomed the appointment of a new, independent figure to oversee the investigation. He could have said that he and his staff were eager to coöperate with the inquiry and with the parallel inquiries on Capitol Hill, adding that, until the investigations reached their conclusions, he would largely refrain from further comment. Such a course of action might have given Trump a bit of leeway. Instead, he retreated further into his bunker on Tuesday, repeating one of his discredited theories about the origins of the investigation. “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News,” he tweeted. Coming on top of the recent reports suggesting that Kushner tried to set up a back channel of communication with the Kremlin last December, such statements only fuel the suspicion that Trump is trying to cover up something. 6. He’s stuck with unpopular Republican policies.
When a President sees his popularity dip, the obvious response is to do something that voters like. But Trump has committed himself to two policy measures that are anything but popular: the House Republicans’ health-care-reform bill and a big tax cut for rich people and large corporations. In a piece at the Federalist a few days ago, Ben Domenech, a conservative-leaning journalist and radio host, argued that Trump ought to back away from the Republican Party’s agenda and look to strike a deal with congressional Democrats on a number of big issues, including health care and taxes. He “should pivot to the more moderate populism that he ran on in the first place,” Domenech wrote, ”working to achieve a bipartisan Obamacare fix, a bipartisan tax reform that includes a new tax entitlement for new moms, a bipartisan infrastructure bill, a higher minimum wage, and no foreign debacles.” This is an interesting idea. But it presupposes that Trump still has enough political capital to alienate members of the Republican leadership and the big conservative donors who back them. That’s far from clear. With the Democratic Party increasingly focussed on impeachment, Trump surely needs to retain all the Republican backing he can in Congress. Pursuing a strategy that endangers the continued support of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan would be a risky punt—it would take an artful and self-disciplined politician to pull it off.

"Weekly Culture Review: Dirty Jokes, from Stephen Colbert to Congress",4804,"Sign up for our newsletter to have the Culture Review delivered to your inbox each week. What have you been listening to this week? For Republicans in the House of Representatives, the soundtrack on Thursday morning, as they gathered to convince one another that they weren’t about to pass one of the more craven and unpopular pieces of legislation in recent memory, was music from the “Rocky” franchise. So pumped up were members by the stirring tunes that one lawmaker, Martha McSally, of Arizona, was moved to exclaim, according to The Hill, “Let’s get this fucking thing done!” After the health-care vote, Democrats, somehow finding an even more dated cultural reference, mockingly sang the chorus of the 1969 hit “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” at their Republican colleagues as they left the floor. Members of Congress weren’t the only ones working blue. On Monday, the late-night host Stephen Colbert said of President Trump, “The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin’s cock holster,” thus raising an important question: Is there such a thing as a joke too lewd about the grab-’em-by-the-pussy President? Twitter activists from the right, citing the recent ouster of Bill O’Reilly from Fox News as a kind of reverse inspiration, voted yes, mounting a #FireColbert campaign, and even some of Colbert’s fans on the left criticized the remark. On Wednesday night, Colbert addressed the backlash, saying, “I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be,” but making a broader point in defense of comedy’s power and responsibility to afflict the powerful. Regarding the President, he noted, “He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So, it’s a fair fight.” Speaking of creative profanity, “Veep” is back for its sixth season, which means the return of my favorite character on the show, the former President Selina Meyer’s earnest assistant Richard Splett, played in a perfect deadpan by Sam Richardson. In addition to his role on “Veep,” Richardson is also one of the stars, along with Tim Robinson, and co-creators of the very funny “Detroiters,” a warm, weird show about two clueless but enthusiastic wannabe admen, which finished its first season on Comedy Central in April. Both of the stars are from greater Detroit, and the show is at once a love letter to their home town, full of inside regional jokes and a general atmosphere of boosterism, and a satire about the rush of gentrification that has recently flooded the Motor City. On Monday, at the Met Gala, which honored the Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo and her label Comme des Garçons, the celebrity haute couture on display was either exceedingly florid, or else slightly obscene. The big draw of the night was Rihanna, in a Comme des Garçons gown that I can’t do justice to in words. Praising the look, Jezebel offered an appraisal that doubles as a good summary of the national mood: “Everyone else sucks!” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Catch up on more of the week in culture: “Ivanka Trump Wrote a Painfully Oblivious Book for Basically No One,” by Jia Tolentino. “Women Who Work” is mostly composed of artless jargon and inspirational quotes you might find by Googling “inspirational quotes.” “Sheryl Sandberg’s “Option B” and the Facebook Way to Grieve,” by Rebecca Mead. In her new book, the Facebook C.O.O. explains how her husband’s death taught her to appreciate the platform’s role in “helping people share.” “Postscript: Jonathan Demme (1944-2017),” by Anthony Lane.

The House G.O.P.’s Shameful Health-Care Victory,7453,"When the House Republican Conference gathered in Washington, D.C., on Thursday morning, it was greeted by a couple of motivational songs: “Eye of the Tiger” and “Taking Care of Business.” On Twitter, the A.P.’s Erica Werner also relayed the message that the Party’s leadership sent to the rank and file, which was equally lacking in subtlety: “It’s time to live or die by this day.” A number of House Republicans, especially those from competitive districts, weren’t overly enthusiastic about fulfilling the health-care suicide pact that Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, was forcing on them. Ultimately, though, a number of countervailing factors won out: loyalty to the Party, eagerness to score a legislative win, hostility toward Barack Obama, free-market ideology, and a reluctance to antagonize wealthy G.O.P. donors. On Thursday afternoon, when it came time to vote on the American Health Care Act of 2017, only twenty Republicans broke ranks, allowing the bill to pass by the slightest of margins. In the most immediate of terms—congressional whip counts—that was a victory for Ryan and his ally in the White House, Donald Trump. On their third attempt at passing an Obamacare-repeal measure, and after much drama and humiliation, the House Republicans had assembled a majority. But at what cost? The vote represented a moral travesty, a betrayal of millions of vulnerable Americans, and a political gift to the Democrats. And if it ultimately costs the House G.O.P. its majority in next year’s midterms, that would be a richly deserved outcome. Ryan and his sidekick, the House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, pushed through a bill that, if it ever goes into effect, could upend one-sixth of the American economy and result in tens of millions of Americans losing their health coverage. Since the Republicans failed to give the Congressional Budget Office time to “score” the bill before voting on it, we don’t have any official estimates of its likely effects. But the bill that was passed on Thursday was an amended version of a bill that the C.B.O. had previously determined would raise the number of uninsured people by twenty-four million over ten years, and increase premiums for many others, particularly the old and the sick, as well. In recent days, a lot of the media coverage was focussed on an amendment to the revised bill that allows individual states to seek a waiver from the Affordable Care Act stipulation that insurers have to cover people with preëxisting conditions. This is a truly hideous feature of the legislation, and a last-minute amendment addressing this issue—intended to convince the Republican congressman Fred Upton to support the legislation—was merely a fig leaf to cover it. Upton secured eight billion dollars in additional funding for “high-risk pools” at the state level, which would cover people with serious illnesses. But, even with the extra Upton money, these pools would be grossly underfunded, and would leave many sick people without coverage—more than eight hundred thousand, according to one analysis. And that wouldn’t be all. If a seriously ill person did find an insurer, he or she could well face prohibitively high premiums. Many states operated high-risk pools before Obamacare went into effect, and the premiums were often set at fifty or a hundred per cent above the going market rate. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? In jettisoning the principle that everybody, regardless of age or health, should be legally entitled to purchase insurance coverage, the House Republicans did something truly awful. The bill would give insurers a lot more leeway to charge higher premiums to old people. Many people in their sixties would see their premiums rise by thousands of dollars; some could see their premiums double. And, even then, they wouldn’t necessarily be getting the same level of coverage that they currently receive. The bill would allow states to opt out of providing all the benefits and treatments that were listed as “essential” under the Affordable Care Act. On top of all this is another huge issue, which I’ve pointed to before. The bill passed on Thursday includes a substantial tax cut for the rich, financed by big cuts in Medicaid, the federal program that provides health care to the poor and indigent. Obamacare expanded Medicaid and chip, the children’s version of the program, and, to pay for these and other provisions, the law imposed a tax of 3.8 per cent on the investment incomes of wealthy households and a 0.9-per-cent surtax on their ordinary incomes. That money has helped sixteen million struggling Americans, many of them kids, obtain health coverage since the start of 2014. The House bill eliminates the Obamacare taxes, reverses the Medicaid expansion, and converts the financing of the program from a per-capita subsidy to a block-grant system. What impact would this have? Since the treatment of Medicaid in the bill that passed is basically unchanged from the original version, we can rely on the C.B.O.’s analysis, which showed that, over ten years, spending on Medicaid would be reduced by almost nine hundred billion dollars. Of the roughly twenty-four million people the C.B.O. estimated would lose their health coverage under the original version of the bill, fourteen million were Medicaid recipients. In short, the bill the House just passed is one of the most regressive pieces of legislation in living memory. When Republicans cut taxes on the rich and slash funding for programs aimed at the poor, they usually go to great lengths to argue that the two things are unconnected. But in this instance they have done away with the subterfuge. It’s reverse Robin Hood, in plain view. Speaking on the House floor just before the bill passed, Ryan thanked Trump for his “steadfast leadership” in supporting the legislation. He also said, “This bill delivers on the promises that we have made to the American people.” It does nothing of the sort, of course; it merely passes the buck to the Senate, where the bill faces an uncertain future. It’s fair to assume that even some of the Republicans who voted for Ryan’s legislation on Thursday will be fervently hoping that their colleagues in the Senate take the bill and bury it in a very deep hole. Should that happen, though, the Democrats will be sure to dig it up in time for next year’s midterm elections. Speaking shortly before Thursday’s vote, Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, singled out Republicans from swing districts and said, “They have this vote tattooed on them. This is a scar they will carry.” And a horrible, ugly scar it is, too. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

A Trump Economic Slowdown?,7358,"During the election campaign, Donald Trump promised to jump-start the American economy and generate annual Gross Domestic Product growth of four per cent, which would represent roughly a doubling in the rate that we've seen since the Great Recession ended. At times, Trump made four per cent sound like a conservative estimate. ""My great economists don't want me to say this, but I think we can do better than that,"" he said, in September of last year. Since Trump got elected, some of his economic advisers, such as Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, have tried to downplay expectations a bit. But Trump hasn't. In his address to a joint session of Congress, in February, he said, ""A new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp."" He has made similar arguments on social media. Last week, he tweeted, ""Economic confidence is soaring as we unleash the power of private sector job creation."" Yet reality seems about to intrude on this Trumpian narrative. At the end of next week, the Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of how the U.S. economy did in the first three months of 2017, a period in which Trump was President for all but nineteen and a half days. Far from showing a quantum leap in G.D.P. growth, the official figures are expected to show a slowdown. In January, when Trump took office, Wall Street economists were expecting first-quarter G.D.P. growth of about 2.3 per cent on an annualized basis, a respectable if unspectacular rate that would have surpassed the 2.1 per cent recorded in the final three months of last year. Since February, however, many economists have been downgrading their forecasts. With retail sales softening and auto production falling, the widely followed Blue Chip consensus of forecasts projects that first-quarter growth will come in at under 1.5 per cent—and some experts believe even that number could be overestimated. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's G.D.P. Now model, which combines various economic statistics to provide a ""nowcast"" of G.D.P. growth, puts the annualized growth rate at just 0.5 per cent. It's always dangerous to rely on economic forecasts. The actual figure from the Commerce Department could still surprise on the upside. Even if it doesn't, it should be treated cautiously. The initial estimates of quarterly G.D.P. growth are based on limited data. As a matter of routine, they are subsequently subjected to two revisions, which are sometimes substantial. Three months from now, growth in the first quarter could look quite a bit stronger (or weaker) than it does now. That said, a number of indicators suggest that the economy has slowed down recently. The latest employment report from the Labor Department, which came out a couple of weeks ago, showed that payrolls rose by just ninety-eight thousand in March, the lowest figure since last May. And last week the Commerce Department announced that retail sales fell back slightly in February and March, the first decline in consecutive months since early 2015. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold On their face, these figures are puzzling. Numerous surveys indicate that consumers, as well as businesses, have grown more confident since Trump won in November. But as Carl Tannenbaum, the chief economist at Northern Trust, told the Wall Street Journal, ""The rising levels of confidence we've seen since the election hasn't translated. Consumers are saying one thing in response to a survey, but doing something different with their wallet."" How should we interpret these developments? The rational reaction is that we shouldn't read too much into one quarter of slow G.D.P. growth, but neither should we be surprised that Trump's election didn't translate into an immediate pickup in the economy. Some of the recent slowdown can be attributed to falling sales in the auto sector, which were perhaps inevitable after record sales during the past couple of years. The unusual winter weather may have played a role as well. Moreover, the economy has several times in the past few years seemed to falter during the first three months of the year, only to pick up again later on. Many economists expect that pattern to repeat itself this year. For 2017 as a whole, the Blue Chip consensus is still predicting G.D.P. growth of slightly more than two per cent, which would represent a modest acceleration from last year's growth rate of 1.6 per cent. It should also be noted, though, that many of these rosy, early forecasts were based on the expectation that Trump would get at least some of his domestic agenda enacted pretty quickly, particularly tax reform, which was expected to provide a modest fiscal boost to the economy. ""Failure by Republicans in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and to pass tax reform legislation this year would likely prompt panelists to cut their forecasts of economic growth for 2017 and 2018,” Randell E. Moore, the executive editor of the Blue Chip survey, noted recently. That scenario now looks like a reality. Despite Trump's statement on Wednesday that ""we're on time, if we get that health-care approval,"" there seems to be little prospect of a new G.O.P. health-care plan making it through Congress anytime soon. The timetable for tax reform, which would likely have a bigger immediate effect on over-all economic growth, is also highly uncertain. Earlier this week, Mnuchin conceded that the Administration is unlikely to hit its target of getting a tax-reform package passed by the summer. It hasn't even released a plan yet—and the same is true for infrastructure. As for Trump's pledge to boost job creation and G.D.P. growth by renegotiating trade agreements and bludgeoning open foreign markets to American goods, that seems more fanciful by the day. What we are left with, then, is a President whose policy agenda appears to be largely stalled, and an economy in which not much has changed. With the unemployment rate down to 4.5 per cent, low interest rates, and wages finally picking up a bit, it seems likely that consumer spending will rebound in the months ahead, boosting the rate of G.D.P. growth. However, even if growth does rebound from the weak first quarter, as the forecasters are predicting, it will mean that the economy is, basically, chugging along at the same modest pace it has been since the current recovery began, in the summer of 2009. That wouldn't be a disaster. It would simply mean that Trump's campaign promises were empty ones. But you probably knew that anyway.

Has Paul Ryan Suckered Donald Trump Into Making Health Care His Top Priority?,7688,"If there was any doubt that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan are now fully conjoined, Trump’s visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning resolved it. After the President tried to cajole and bully the Republican congressmen into voting for their leaders’ controversial plan to replace Obamacare, Ryan praised Trump lavishly, saying he “came here and knocked the ball out of the park . . . in explaining to our members how it’s important to unify, how it’s important to work together, how we are advancing our principles and we are doing what we told the American people we would do.” It’s no mystery why Ryan was so expansive. A President who campaigned as an insurgent and a new type of Republican is staking his Presidency on a piece of legislation that reflects the long-established priorities of conservative G.O.P. ideologues. For seven years now, House Republicans and their wealthy donors have been desperate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which established the principle of universal coverage, and came with new taxes that hit the country’s top earners. To the likes of Ryan and Tom Price, who is now Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, the A.C.A. amounted to a new entitlement program, one that, over the years, was likely to get bigger and bigger. The only solution was infanticide: the A.C.A. had to be killed before it was fully grown. After Trump won the election, there were still some reasons to doubt whether Ryan and Price would get what they wanted—or, at least, whether they would get it this quickly. To be sure, Trump promised to repeal the A.C.A. during his campaign. But he also promised to renegotiate trade agreements, rebuild America's decaying infrastructure, construct a wall across the southern border, crack down on Wall Street, and reduce taxes for corporations and the middle class. As with any incoming President, the key question during the transition was what priorities Trump would set once he took office. Prioritizing trade, the wall, infrastructure, and tax relief would have been consistent with the image he established of himself as a nationalist, a builder, and a populist. But today, two months after the Inauguration, health care is front and center. Practically everything else—renegotiating nafta, confronting Chinese mercantilism, the trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, comprehensive tax reform—has been placed on the back burner. How did Trump get himself into this position? Two days after the election, he said that his Administration would have “a lot of really great priorities . . . We’re looking very strongly at immigration. We’re going to look at the borders, very importantly. We’re looking very strongly at health care and we’re looking at jobs. Big-league jobs.” It was Ryan, in early December, who publicly pushed health care to the top of the list. “Well, the first bill we’re going to be working on is our Obamacare legislation,” he told CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “We want to make sure that we have a good transition period so that people can get better coverage at a better price.” By the start of this year, Trump had adopted the Ryan timetable, ignoring warnings that he might be making a huge mistake. On January 10th, he told the Times that he wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare straight away, saying*,* “We have to get to business.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? Because Trump didn’t have a health-care reform plan of his own, or anything that resembled one, his decision to make replacing Obamacare his first priority also amounted to a decision to outsource the job to Ryan. The Speaker had a plan ready, one that clearly violated a pledge Trump made to provide insurance for all—a promise he repeated as recently as mid-January. Still, something always beats nothing. Ryan’s regressive blueprint became the basis of the bill that Trump endorsed and that the House plans to vote upon on Thursday. Even now, it isn't entirely clear why Trump and his advisers went down this route rather than, say, first demanding tax reform and an infrastructure bill, which they could have co-branded as a jobs program. Were they responding to polling after the election that showed health care was a priority for voters? Did they think that targeting Obamacare immediately was necessary to get Republicans to support the rest of their agenda? Did Ryan sucker Trump? Whatever the answer is, going all in on health care was a high-risk strategy. Even if the House passes its bill on Thursday, its prospects in the Senate are uncertain. Republicans can afford to lose just two votes in the upper chamber. Already, four G.O.P. senators have said that they don’t support the current bill, and more opposition may be on the way. A number of Republican senators are rightly concerned that the bill will reverse Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid, which has provided health insurance to millions of low-paid and poverty-stricken Americans. Ryan tried to assuage some concerns by introducing some amendments to the bill earlier this week—but they won’t put an end to these issues. If Ryan’s bill goes down, it would be a grave embarrassment for Trump, but, in the long term, enacting the legislation could be much more damaging. According to a tally of recent polling by Five Thirty Eight’s Nate Silver, about thirty per cent of Americans support the G.O.P. bill, and forty-seven per cent oppose it. Even among self-identified Republican voters, who make up about a third of the electorate, there are reservations. In a survey by YouGov, forty-nine per cent of Republicans said that they favored the G.O.P. bill, twenty per cent said that they opposed it, and thirty per cent said that they weren’t sure. Just fifteen per cent of Republicans said that they strongly favored the proposal. These figures could change, of course. But how likely are they to get better for Trump? According to the Congressional Budget Office, the G.O.P. legislation, in its unamended form, would raise premiums in the individual insurance market by up to twenty per cent over the first couple of years. About fourteen million people would lose their coverage almost immediately. (The C.B.O. hasn’t fully scored the amended bill, but experts say the changes wouldn’t make much of a difference to these figures.) During the transition to a new system, which would inevitably be somewhat chaotic, dry numbers like these would be converted into real people. There would be stories of the sick and the old and the poor—some of them Trump supporters—getting priced out of coverage. And Trump, despite his obvious distaste for the label “Trumpcare,” would have his name on the legislation once he signed it into law. Either he is oblivious to the dangers or he is putting on a brave face. “Big day for healthcare,” he tweeted on Wednesday morning. “Working hard!” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Martin Shkreli Is Still Talking,6183,"On a recent evening, Martin Shkreli was drinking beer at Tuttles, a bar in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan that has sticky wooden tables and sports playing on TV. He was taking a break from two activities that now consume much of his time: writing computer code for a new company he heads and meeting with his lawyers in anticipation of his upcoming criminal fraud trial. “I think they’ll return a not-guilty verdict in two hours,” he said. “There are going to be jurors who will be fans of mine. I walk down the streets of New York and people shake my hand. They say, ‘I want to be just like you.’ ” Shkreli achieved infamy as the founder and C.E.O. of Turing Pharmaceuticals, where he applied strategies honed in his career as a hedge-fund manager. Under his direction, Turing acquired a drug called Daraprim, which treats a parasitic infection that can be deadly when it afflicts unborn babies and people with H.I.V. and aids, and then raised the price of a single pill from $13.50 to seven hundred and fifty dollars. Although Shkreli’s company wasn’t the first to order such a price increase, his did so in the late summer of 2015, as the Presidential race was warming up. He was also arrogantly unapologetic about it. Hillary Clinton accused him of “price gouging,” and he was described in the press as “the most hated man in America.” That December, just weeks after Donald Trump referred to him as a “spoiled brat,” Shkreli was arrested and charged with securities fraud in a case involving his hedge funds, MSMB Capital Management L.P. and MSMB Healthcare L.P., and another drug company that he had founded, called Retrophin. (He denied the charges.) Shkreli, now thirty-four, has pale, thin arms and black hair that falls into his eyes. He can be more self-effacing and thoughtful than his public persona would suggest. “Many men are sensitive about their psychiatric well-being,” he said, explaining that he used to have anxiety attacks every day. “I saw a psychiatrist a long time ago. He said, ‘Martin, you have anxiety. Take this pill.’ ” The medication was Effexor. Shkreli went on, “My affinity for pharmaceuticals is partly due to the miracle of that pill.” He used to be a provocative user of Twitter (he was suspended from the service in January) and now live-streams himself on Facebook, where he has more than seventy thousand followers. He is well versed in many subjects: romantic relationships, drug-pricing models, his entrepreneurial feats, and the hedge-fund manager Steven Cohen. At Tuttles, Shkreli was eager to discuss what he claimed was his underappreciated role in the downfall of Cohen’s fund, S.A.C. Capital. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media He said that in 2008, when he was working as a portfolio manager, he invested money in shares of a pharmaceutical company called Elan, which was conducting a clinical trial of a promising Alzheimer’s drug. On the morning that the trial results were set to be announced, Shkreli watched Elan’s stock price excitedly. “The stock was up two bucks, so I’m giddy,” he said. When the price started to move erratically—he remembers it lurching up three dollars and then down two—he became convinced that inside information about the results was leaking to certain traders with sizable stakes in Elan. Shkreli said that he called the New York Stock Exchange to complain, suggesting that it temporarily halt trading in the stock until the results of the trial were released. Later that day, after the results were announced and they failed to meet expectations, Elan’s stock price quickly fell by almost forty-two per cent. “I was devastated,” Shkreli said. The government ended up investigating Elan, and in 2012 it indicted an S.A.C. portfolio manager named Mathew Martoma on insider-trading charges. Martoma was convicted. (He denied the charges and his case is on appeal.) The Elan case also helped lead the government, in 2013, to bring insider-trading charges against S.A.C. Capital itself. S.A.C. closed after Cohen agreed to pay more than a billion dollars in fines. It is difficult to confirm Shkreli’s story, although its outlines conform to what is known about how the investigation started. Shkreli himself seemed to delight in the idea of being the catalyst for one of the biggest insider-trading cases in U.S. history. Now Shkreli is facing serious legal troubles of his own. The federal government has accused him of fraud, contending that he misappropriated funds from his three companies in order to conceal losses and mislead investors. As Robert Capers, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, described it, “Shkreli essentially ran his companies like a Ponzi scheme.” (In an unrelated twist, S.A.C. Capital disclosed in 2014 that it had bought stock in Retrophin.) Shkreli claims that the government misunderstood what happened and picked on him because he had been so vilified for the drug-price hike. “This case never would have happened if Daraprim hadn’t happened,” he said. Shkreli hinted that he intended to testify at his trial, which starts in June. In the meantime, he is working on a new biotech-software startup, called Godel Systems, which he won’t describe in detail. “I haven’t told anybody what it is,” he said. “When I do, it will shock and awe the world.” It was almost 9 p.m. when Shkreli drained his second glass of beer. He suddenly looked alert, remembering that he had received a jury-duty summons. He looked at his phone and said, “Shit, I might have missed it. What day is it?” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. By Rachel B. Doyle By Kelefa Sanneh Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Devin Nunes and the Ethics Watchdogs,7426,"Norm Eisen, the dean of Washington ethics watchdogs, has a simple way of describing his reaction to hearing Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lawmaker formerly in charge of an investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election, disclose classified information to the press last month. “I fell out of my chair,” Eisen told me. It’s still not entirely clear what Nunes was up to when, on March 22nd, after reviewing classified intelligence reports at the White House the previous night, he held two press conferences to tell reporters about what he’d seen. The reports apparently suggested that President Trump and his associates had been “incidentally” surveilled by U.S. intelligence agencies. “This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under fisa, where there was incidental collection that then ended up in reporting channels and was widely disseminated,” Nunes said at his first press conference that day, at the Capitol. After meeting with Trump at the White House, Nunes spoke to reporters again, and added, “It has to do with fisa, and there are multiple fisa warrants that are out there, but there’s nothing criminal at all involved.” He said that the intercepts he reviewed included the names of Trump Administration officials and possibly the President himself. The effort seemed intended to divert attention from his own committee’s probe, and to offer Trump cover for his false tweets claiming that Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. Eisen, who once served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic, immediately recognized that Nunes had said things he shouldn’t have. “Ambassadors get the highest security clearance, and I was trained to be responsible for the appropriate management of classified information,” he said. “In addition to all the other shenanigans and bizarre contortions of Nunes, he described in such detail what he had seen at the White House. You just don’t do that.” The very existence of a fisa warrant is highly classified information, and Nunes casually talked about “multiple” warrants. And, while his language was vague, his description of intercepts—presumably of foreign officials talking to or about Trump and his associates—risked tipping off the targets of N.S.A. surveillance. Earlier this year, Nunes had decried the leak of an intercepted conversation between Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador, and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national-security adviser. But in disclosing what he saw at the White House Nunes appeared to be doing something similar. Only instead of leaking the classified information anonymously, he was talking about it in front of cameras. A week later, Eisen’s nonprofit group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (crew), along with Democracy 21, sent a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics, requesting that it investigate whether Nunes disclosed classified information “in violation of House Ethics Rules.” Last Thursday, in a move that was overshadowed by the air strike on Syria, the House Ethics Committee announced that it was formally investigating Nunes. That was enough to prompt Nunes to step down from leading the Russia probe. He handed responsibility over to Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, and took a shot at Eisen and his fellow ethics advocates as he departed. “Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics,” Nunes said in a statement. “The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist After almost three weeks spent sidetracked by Trump’s tweets and Nunes’s antics, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are optimistic that they will be able to get back to investigating Russia. “It gives us a chance to have a fresh start,” Adam Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the committee and who had called for Nunes to recuse himself, told me. The larger lesson of the Nunes episode is that some of the creaky machinery of ethics checks and balances in Washington is still capable of functioning. To be sure, the House Oversight Committee, which spent years vigorously investigating the Obama Administration, has been essentially shuttered by its chairman, Jason Chaffetz. But outside ethics watchdogs are keeping busy in Trump’s Washington. crew is perhaps the best example. Earlier this year, House Republicans tried to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics—an independent entity set up by the House—prompting an outcry, led by crew, which even caught Trump’s attention. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!” Trump said on Twitter. The lawmakers backed down. In February, after Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump’s retail brand, crew filed a complaint against her. When reports surfaced that Ivanka might take a role in the White House without formally being an employee—thus potentially skirting numerous ethical and reporting requirements—a complaint filed by crew reportedly prompted the White House to classify her as an employee after all. The group was also part of the push to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any federal investigation of the 2016 campaign. Before taking office, Trump ignored the advice of the federal Office of Government Ethics, which publicly pressed him to operate under the same rules required for his Cabinet members and to fully divest from his business interests. As a result, a key question of the Trump era is whether he might be in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits officials from receiving gifts from foreign states, when, for instance, foreign diplomats pay for rooms at Trump hotels. In January, crew filed a lawsuit over the emoluments issue, though several legal scholars have noted that the group may have a tough time making the case that it has standing to sue Trump. Eisen, who is unfailingly optimistic, disagrees. “I think that the public awareness of this unethical governing environment has something to do with Trump’s mid-thirties approval ratings,” he said. “I think that our emoluments case is going to be the most impactful of all.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Keystone Kops in the White House,7958,"""My fellow-Americans,"" Donald Trump said in his weekly address on Friday, ""It's an exciting time for our country. Our new Administration has so much change under way— change that is going to strengthen our Union and improve so many people’s lives."" It's exciting, all right; in fact, it is hard to look away. Just when you think things can't get worse for the Trump Administration, it drops another clanger on itself. Three weeks ago, the White House unveiled its revised anti-Muslim travel ban, which the federal courts immediately froze, on constitutional grounds, just as they had blocked its predecessor. Last week, there was the ignominious failure of the G.O.P. health-care bill, which Trump had personally endorsed, although he seemed blissfully unaware of some of its contents. And this week there was the still-developing saga of Devin Nunes, the bumbling head of the House Intelligence Committee, who unwisely tried to do the President a favor and ended up being publicly humiliated. It is now perfectly evident that Nunes, in claiming he had evidence that Trump and his aides had been caught up in ""incidental surveillance"" during the transition, was doing the White House's bidding and trying to create a diversion from James Comey's confirmation that the F.B.I. is investigating whether Trump’s campaign coördinated with Russia. According to a Times report, Nunes obtained access to intelligence information from at least two Administration aides when he visited the White House on the night of March 21st, though he initially denied coördinating with anybody who works there. One of the White House staffers was reportedly a member of the National Security Council, and the other was a lawyer in the office of the White House counsel who used to work for Nunes's committee on Capitol Hill. So far, Nunes has managed to cling to his committee post, but he has about as much credibility left as a thief caught inside a bank vault. At Friday’s White House press briefing, Glenn Thrush, of the Times, asked Sean Spicer, Trump’s spokesman, whether it was normal for the head of an investigatory committee to roam the White House complex at night and meet two mid-level staffers to see sensitive information. Spicer didn't have much of an answer, of course. But the larger story here goes beyond Nunes and his nocturnal wanderings. It concerns the White House's competence—or lack thereof. Ten weeks ago, when Trump stormed into office attacking the media and promising a blitzkrieg of new policies and initiatives during his first hundred days, the dominant emotion among people who hadn't voted for him was fear. Many commentators, myself included, warned about the dangers of democratic erosion, and sales of George Orwell's ""1984"" soared. Today, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned about Trump and his illiberalism. The White House's recent decision to dismantle President Obama's clean-air regulations offers fresh testament to the malevolence of the Trump Administration’s agenda, and next week's meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, China's President, will be a reminder of the enormous responsibilities that rest on a President's shoulders. But, even among ardent Trumpophobes, fear and foreboding have been supplemented by wonderment at the White House’s string of gaffes. These days, instead of Big Brother, it often looks like the Keystone Kops are in charge. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist In an interview with Tucker Carlson, of Fox News, a couple of weeks ago, Trump hinted that the White House had some information about possible surveillance by the Obama Administration that it would like the public to see. ""We will be submitting certain things, and I will be perhaps speaking about this next week,” he said. The surprise wasn’t that the White House would subsequently use a political ally (Nunes) as a conduit. It was that the operation was handled so clumsily that it backfired almost immediately. ""It's hard to know who is dumber: the Trump White House for giving Nunes the info or Nunes for accepting it. Pure Amateur hour,"" Dan Pfeiffer, a former director of communications in the Obama White House, tweeted on Thursday. Pfeiffer isn't a neutral player, of course. But the Nunes fiasco is hardly an isolated incident. Consider the fallout from the health-care debacle. Since the moment that Paul Ryan pulled his Obamacare-replacement bill from consideration in the House, Trump's options for pursuing other elements of his domestic agenda, and perhaps even resuscitating health-care reform, have been clear. He can move even further to the right, to placate the members of the recalcitrant Freedom Caucus, or he can abandon them and try to win over some moderate Democrats. Last weekend, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, indicated that the White House would follow the second strategy, and other Administration officials floated the idea of reaching a deal with congressional Democrats on tax reform and infrastructure spending. But Trump himself didn’t appear to have been let in on the plan—he continued to bait and berate the opposition party. ""The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long,"" he tweeted on Monday. ""Do not worry, we are in very good shape!"" On the same day, in a pair of tweets, the President also went after his favorite Democratic target, Hillary Clinton. ""Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech . . . money to Bill, the Hillary Russian 'reset,' praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #maga!"" On Thursday, Trump directed his fire at the Freedom Caucus. In a tweet, he said that they would ""hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!"" This lumping together of the Freedom Caucus and the Democrats came the morning after a group of conservative activists visited the White House for what was billed as a friendly policy session. If Trump had decided to declare war on the right, he evidently hadn't informed the members of his staff who arranged that session. Mixed signals are nothing new from the Trump Administration. On Thursday, a reporter from Axios, the news site, sat in on a strategy session attended by Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner. The session was ""on background,"" which meant the reporter couldn't identify who said what. But, on Friday morning, Mike Allen, Axios's editor-in-chief, reported that one of the officials in the meeting ""views the Trump White House in terms that could be applied to the iterative process of designing software. It's a beta White House."" Allen went on, ""The senior official . . . said the White House was operating on similar principles to the Trump campaign: 'We rode something until it didn't work any more,' the official said. 'We recognized it didn't work, we changed it, we adjusted it and then we kind of got better . . . [T]his was much more entrepreneurial.' In the White House, he said, 'we're going to keep adjusting until we get it right.' "" No word on how long this adjustment process might take, or what role the man with the itchy Twitter finger might play in it.

C.B.O. Report Leaves Trump in a Political Jam on Health Care,8990,"When it comes to spotting an opportune moment to hold a press conference, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, has few equals. There he was on Tuesday morning, surrounded by nurses, patients, and health-care advocates. The subject at hand was the Congressional Budget Office's new estimate that House Republicans’ proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act, which President Trump has endorsed, would swell the number of uninsured Americans by twenty-four million over ten years, while also raising insurance premiums for older people, gutting Medicaid, and providing a hefty tax cut to many of the richest people in the country. ""If there was ever a war on seniors, this bill is it,"" Schumer said. ""It spends more on tax cuts for health-insurance companies and the wealthy than on tax credits to help the middle class. It's vintage Donald Trump. He talks like a populist, but when he acts it’s hard right, favoring the special interests, hurting the middle class and those striving to get there."" Schumer also obliquely addressed some members of the Administration—such as Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget—who have tried to dismiss the C.B.O.'s numbers. Schumer pointed out that when Tom Price, Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, was in Congress, he helped to appoint the current head of the C.B.O., Keith Hall, who previously worked at the Mercatur Institute, a right-wing research organization funded, in part, by the Koch brothers. ""And now they are saying what he is saying isn't real,"" Schumer said, employing a shocked tone. ""Do facts matter anymore to our colleagues, to the President? Does truth matter? Sad, as somebody once said.” That jibe at Trump earned Schumer some smiles from the people standing behind him. Whether Trump was watching the press conference on TV is unknown, but about half an hour after Schumer spoke the President tweeted out a message that said, ""JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"" and showed a screenshot of some figures from the latest employment report from the Labor Department, which came out last Friday. A bit later, Trump linked to a Bloomberg News story about rising optimism among the country’s C.E.O.s and wrote, ""Great optimism in America—and the results will be even better!"" On a day when the front pages of newspapers all across the country were blaring out the C.B.O.’s twenty-four-million figure, surely even Trump wasn't delusional enough to think he could change the subject that easily. He might, instead, have been trying to cheer himself up, or perhaps to distance himself from the Republican plan. In his daily briefing, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, insisted that Trump was ""proud"" of the bill and dismissed the C.B.O.'s figures as ""consistently wrong."" But Spicer also said that the President didn't want the health-care proposal to be named after him. Later on Tuesday, Trump met with Paul Ryan, the bill’s primary backer, and other Republican leaders. At this stage, the President has three possible options in front of him for how to deal with health care, none of which he may find particularly palatable or easy to follow through on. The first option is to tough it out, sticking with the House Republican legislation and seeking to shrug off or belittle the C.B.O.'s analysis. This was the strategy that Spicer tried on Tuesday, when he claimed that the C.B.O. analysis failed to take into account follow-on legislation that the White House and the Republicans intend to propose which would get rid of many of the A.C.A.'s coverage guidelines, enabling insurers to offer cheaper, lower-quality plans that, the White House claims, will prove popular. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media There are several problems with this strategy, however. To begin with, the reason the additional measures that Spicer mentioned aren't included in Ryan's current proposal is that they would require sixty votes in the Senate to pass. The Republicans have only fifty-two votes, and there is virtually no prospect of them getting another eight. Moreover, in order to get this bill through the House, the Republican leadership might have to make it even more draconian in order to satisfy ultra-conservatives, who continue to insist that it doesn't go far enough in dismantling the A.C.A. On Tuesday morning, Jim Jordan, the Ohio representative who heads the Freedom Caucus, said on Fox News, ""Remember, this bill doesn't repeal Obamacare. This bill doesn't unite Republicans. This bill doesn't bring down the cost of premiums."" Jordan added that he and his colleagues would offer a series of amendments to the legislation when it comes to the House floor, next week. These are likely to include things like moving up the dismantling of the A.C.A.'s Medicaid expansion from 2020 to 2018, which would only further increase the number of uninsured. That points to the larger problem. If he sticks with the current bill, Trump would be tied to a proposal that would do great harm to many of his supporters and make a mockery of his claims to be a populist. As I have pointed out, the twenty-four-million estimate for the rise in the number of uninsured is far from the only damaging figure in the C.B.O. report. It also says, for example, that a sixty-four-year-old earning an income of twenty-six thousand dollars a year could see his or her insurance premiums rise by twelve thousand nine hundred dollars annually. A second option would be for Trump to gently distance himself from the Ryans and the Jordans of the world, and ally himself with Republican senators such as Louisiana's Bill Cassidy and Maine's Susan Collins, who have accepted the C.B.O.'s figures and are calling for big changes to the House proposal. ""It’s an awful score for the authors of the bill,"" Cassidy said on Tuesday. ""You can’t sugarcoat it.” The White House does have a bit of room to work with. Largely because of the huge cuts to Medicaid that the House proposal would entail, the C.B.O. estimated that it would reduce the budget deficit by three hundred and thirty-seven billion dollars over ten years. The Trump Administration could, for example, push to take some of this money and make the tax credits in the bill more generous, especially for lower-income people, or preserve at least part of the Medicaid expansion. (That is what Cassidy and Collins advocated in a bill they put forward in January.) If the White House preserved some of the taxes imposed by the A.C.A., which fell on people earning more than a quarter of a million dollars a year, it would have even more leeway to come up with a less damaging proposal. The challenge would be getting the movement conservatives in the House and Senate to go along with such an approach. But at least one of Trump's friends thinks he should take the risk of alienating the ultras and strive to put together a health-care bill that fulfills his campaign promise to cover everybody. Chris Ruddy, the founder of the conservative news site Newsmax, wrote in a piece published Tuesday that it's time for Trump to ""ditch the Freedom Caucus and the handful of Senate Republicans who want a complete repeal of Obamacare. They don't agree with universal coverage and will never be placated."" Once Trump has veered away from the right, Ruddy went on, he could find a few parts of the Ryan plan that might win majority support. But he should also ""reject the phony private health insurance market as the panacea. Look to an upgraded Medicaid system to become the country's blanket insurer for the uninsured. Tie Medicaid funding to states with the requirement each pass legislation to allow for a truly nationwide healthcare market."" Following Ruddy's advice, or doing something similar, represents the third option for Trump. It would be a big reversal, of course, and it would put him on a collision course with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, whose support he needs in many other areas, including his efforts to resist calls for a proper public investigation of his campaign's reported ties to Russia. As of now, there is no sign of such a shift. Trump seems to be stuck. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Can Donald Trump Learn from Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill?,12448,"On April 28, 1982, fifteen months into his first term, President Ronald Reagan went up to Capitol Hill to meet with Tip O’Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House. The two Irish-American politicians had to that point been bitter enemies. As Reagan had pursued his conservative agenda of tax cuts, a military buildup, and deregulation, O’Neill had done everything he could to resist. Now, though, with the budget deficit rising and the markets getting concerned about Washington’s solvency, the Republican and the Democrat needed each other’s help. The White House wanted to cut domestic spending, including Social Security. O’Neill wanted to safeguard entitlement programs and reverse some of Reagan’s tax cuts for the rich. The meeting took place in the President’s Room, just off the Senate floor. As Laurence I. Barrett, a Time magazine reporter, recalled in his book “Gambling with History: Reagan in the White House,” from 1983, Reagan broke the ice by telling an off-color Irish joke that ended with the punch line “So I told her to shit in her hat and the fight was on.” Despite this inauspicious beginning, the two sides stuck at it. Four months later, they announced an agreement that formed the basis of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which increased tax revenues by about one per cent of G.D.P. Reagan and O’Neill also set up a bipartisan commission on Social Security, and the following year they both endorsed a set of reforms that put the finances of the public retirement system on a firmer footing. (The agreement delayed a cost-of-living adjustment and raised the retirement age. It also increased contributions and cut benefits for future retirees.) Could this episode provide inspiration for Donald Trump following the demise of the House Republican health-care bill? Some reports say that Trump is so angry at the conservative Republicans who deserted him that he may change tack and reach out to Democrats. “This President is not going to be a partisan President,” Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think it’s time for our folks to come together; I also think it’s time to potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board as well.” On certain issues, the idea of the White House picking up some Democratic votes is not outlandish. A number of Democratic senators are up for reëlection in 2018 in states that Trump won last year—and they might see working with the President as in their interest. In an extensively reported new piece in the Times Magazine, “Trump and Congress: Now What?,” Robert Draper recounts a December get-together between Trump and one of these senators, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, at which Stephen Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, took Manchin aside: “The thing you need to know about Trump,” Bannon said, “is he doesn’t care about the Republican Party and he doesn’t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.” In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure. On Tuesday, the White House is expected to release an executive order reversing some of the Obama Administration’s efforts to promote clean air and tackle climate change by limiting emissions at coal-fired power stations. The order may also end a moratorium on coal mining on federal lands. Manchin, who in 2013 accused Barack Obama of declaring a war on coal, will surely support these measures. That could help the White House some, but the executive order will further alienate the vast majority of Democrats. Given the scale of the defeat Trump just suffered, he needs to put up some big victories—and soon. With health-care reform sidelined and his travel ban frozen, the three main items on his domestic agenda are trade, tax reform, and infrastructure. In each of these areas, there are formidable barriers to getting legislation passed, with or without the odd Democratic supporter. Altering trade treaties requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Comprehensive tax reform of the sort Trump and his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have talked about would involve eliminating a vast array of tax breaks and loopholes, almost all of which have powerful lobbies supporting them. And although Trump has touted a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that could conceivably attract Democratic support, he hasn’t said how he would pay for it. Until he does, it’s a nonstarter. There’s a larger issue, too. Before Trump reaches out to Democrats, if that is his intention, he needs to decide who he is. Is he an economic populist or a trickle-down supply-sider? Is he a protectionist or a free trader who merely talks tough? Is he a big-government nationalist or a small-government Republican? At the moment, Trump is talking like a populist and acting like a Paul Ryan Republican. The health-care bill would have amounted to a substantial tax cut for the very rich, financed by cuts in Medicaid, which serves the poor. The White House has yet to put forward a complete tax plan, but the proposal Trump campaigned on was hugely regressive. If it were enacted, the top tax rate would be reduced from 39.6 per cent to thirty-three per cent; the corporate tax rate, which also applies to investment partnerships, law firms, and other business partnerships, would be cut from thirty-five per cent to fifteen per cent; the estate tax would be eliminated, and so would the alternative minimum tax. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that Trump’s tax proposal would reduce the tax bills of middle-income Americans by about one per cent ($1,090 a year). Households in the top one per cent would get a tax cut of about nine and a half per cent ($317,100 a year). The Trump Administration says that figures like this are misleading because they don’t take account of all the loopholes that will be eliminated. Steven Mnuchin, the Secretary of the Treasury, has stated flatly that “there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” without providing any figures to back up this dubious claim. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? Meanwhile, the Administration is quietly going about the business of stripping away regulations in order to benefit corporations. Working with its own conservative appointees and Republicans in Congress, it has already relaxed rules preventing mining companies from polluting streams and other sources of drinking water, passed a bill that rolls back workplace-safety regulations, and reversed an Obama Administration policy to stop employing private companies to run federal prisons. Trump has also proposed a Voldemort budget that demands sweeping cuts everywhere except the Pentagon. It would even cut programs that support after-school activities for poor kids and Meals on Wheels deliveries for the elderly. Citing some of these developments, the Washington Post’s James Hohmann argued on Monday that “Trump is systematically succeeding in his quest to ‘deconstruct the administrative state,’ as his chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon puts it.” That may be going too far. But Trump is certainly pursuing a set of policies that could have been explicitly designed to alienate Democrats, and to preclude any sort of political accommodation. Another factor to take into account: from what we’ve seen, Trump lacks the political skills to unite his own party, let alone win over Democrats. He’s a ranter who makes things up as he goes along. Reagan’s geniality was his big advantage, and when it came to policy details he often deferred to aides who knew what they were doing. Trump sorely lacks an equivalent to James Baker, Reagan’s wily chief of staff, who helped arrange the negotiations with O’Neill. Instead of Baker, Trump has Bannon, Priebus, and Jared Kushner—who appear to spend much of their time sniping at each other. Even if the White House could learn from its early mistakes and start presenting a united front, the political environment has changed a lot since the early eighties—bipartisanship is much harder to achieve. Back then, O’Neill worried that his party might be punished in the 1982 midterms if it came to be perceived as needlessly obstructionist. After the past eight years, the accepted wisdom in Washington today is that obstructionism works and coöperation doesn’t. The electorate is so polarized that you don’t get credit for reaching across the aisle. All you do is rile up your party’s base and undermine your own position. The safer strategy is to copy Mitch McConnell’s tactics during the Obama era: obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, understands this dynamic. Immediately after the election, he briefly indicated a willingness to work with Trump in certain areas. Now he is busy fighting the President’s entire legislative agenda, trying to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, and calling on Ryan to choose a replacement for Devin Nunes as head of the House Intelligence Committee. In an interview with ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Schumer said that Trump, upon taking office, “moved so far to the hard right that it’s virtually impossible for us to work with him.” That is true, but Schumer is also following the path of least resistance. Trump appears to be floundering, and many Democratic voters consider him an illegitimate President. For all these reasons, Trump will face a mighty challenge if he tries to pivot and attract Democrats. But the lessons of 1982 can’t be dismissed entirely. When Reagan started talking with O’Neill, a number of conservative Republicans in Congress, and even some members of his own staff, opposed him. On the Democratic side, liberals hated Reagan, and they resisted the idea of making concessions on entitlement programs. Much like Schumer is today, O’Neill was wary of being seen to consort with the enemy. At their meeting on April 28th, O’Neill “consented to sit next to Reagan for the obligatory ‘photo opportunity,’ but wanted it noted that he would move to the other side of the mahogany table to join his Democratic colleagues for the real business,” Barrett wrote. Contrary to Washington mythology, Reagan and O’Neill never became close. But on this occasion circumstances drove them to coöperate. Could something similar happen to Trump and Schumer, or Trump and Nancy Pelosi? One possibility is that the White House could twin tax reform with infrastructure spending, and seek a bargain with the Democrats. Even if that doesn’t happen, some coöperation may be essential. Later this year, Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling to prevent a federal government shutdown. If history repeats itself and the members of the Freedom Caucus balk at approving a raise, as they did during the Obama years, the White House will need the support of House Democrats to get such a measure through. Trump, if he can overcome his aversion to reading, should find a copy of Barrett’s book. Instead of doing that, though, he’s immediately gone back to attacking Democrats and sounding like a crazy person. On Saturday, he tweeted: “The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry, we are in very good shape!” On Monday night, he wrote, “Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....” Does that sound a like a President who is preparing a change of course, or who is capable of learning anything?

Exposed: Donald Trump’s Sham Populism,7855,"Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House Majority Leader, went on Sean Hannity's show on Thursday night and tried to talk up the awful health-care bill that his party had just rushed through two committees. His message was aimed at the ultra-conservative groups, such as the Freedom Caucus and Heritage Action for America, that have come out strongly against the proposed legislation. McCarthy didn't try to claim that the bill would make health care more affordable or widely available. Instead, he defended its conservative bona fides, twice pointing out that it would repeal all the taxes that were introduced under the Affordable Care Act—taxes that mainly hit the one per cent. Hannity, who is one of President Trump's biggest boosters, didn't hide his loyalties or his concern about the political firestorm that the bill has set off. ""This has to work: there is no option here,"" he said at one point. Later, he warned, ""As soon as it passes, you own it."" Intentionally or not, Hannity summed up the political dilemma facing Trump and his Administration. The White House has embraced Paul Ryan's handiwork—the House Speaker is the bill’s top backer—and they are now trying together to persuade the full House and the Senate to vote for at least some version of it. But if the bill does pass and Trump signs it into law, what happens then? The health-care industry will be thrown into turmoil; many millions of Americans will lose their coverage; many others, including a lot of Trump voters (particularly elderly ones), will see their premiums rise sharply; and Trump will risk being just as closely associated with ""Trumpcare"" as Barack Obama was with Obamacare. Two questions arise: Why did Ryan and his colleagues propose such a lemon? And why did Trump agree to throw his backing behind it? The first question is easier to answer. For seven years, promising to get rid of Obamacare has been a rallying cry for Republicans on Capitol Hill—one supported by both Party leaders and activists, as well as by big donors, such as the Koch brothers. It was inevitable that, if the G.O.P. ever took power, it would move to fulfill this pledge, despite the human costs of doing so. What wasn't anticipated was that the Republican leadership would run into hostility from the right. But that, too, is explainable. After November's election, Ryan and his colleagues were forced to face the reality that fully repealing the A.C.A. would require sixty votes in the Senate, which wasn't achievable. Many of the things that ultra-conservatives see as shortcomings in the bill now being considered—such as the retention of rules dictating what sorts of policies insurers can offer—are in there to make sure that the Senate can pass the bill as part of the budget-reconciliation process, which requires just fifty-one votes. As McCarthy explained to Hannity, ""The challenge is the process of how we have to do this."" The more interesting question is why Trump would stake his credibility on such a deeply regressive, and potentially unpopular, proposal. During the campaign, he frequently promised to repeal Obamacare—but it wasn't one of his main issues. Clamping down on immigration, embracing economic protectionism, rebuilding infrastructure, and blowing a raspberry at the Washington establishment were much more central to his platform. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures Early in the campaign, in fact, Trump praised socialized medicine, and promised to provide everybody with health care. ""As far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland,"" he said in August, 2015, during the first Republican debate. A month later, he told “60 Minutes,” ""I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.” Part of what is going on is that Trump needs a quick legislative success. He is keenly aware that, by this stage in his Presidency, Obama had signed a number of important bills, including a big stimulus package. Trump also badly needs to change the subject from Russia. It might sound crazy to suggest that a President would embrace a bill that could do him great harm in the long term just for a few days’ respite, but these are crazy times. If nothing else, the political furor surrounding the House G.O.P. proposal has eclipsed the headlines about Trump claiming that Obama wiretapped him. For much of this week, Trump has ducked out of sight, letting Ryan and his bill take the spotlight. That's not the only way the Russian story may have played into this. As the pressure grows for a proper independent probe of Trump's ties to Moscow, he must retain the support of the G.O.P. leadership, which has the power to block such an investigation. It has long been clear that the relationship between the Republican Party and Trump is based on a quid pro quo, at least tacitly: in return for dismissing concerns about his authoritarianism, self-dealing, and Russophilia, the Party gets to enact some of the soak-the-poor policies it has long been promoting. For a time, it seemed like Trump was the senior partner in this arrangement. But now Republicans like Ryan have more leverage, and Trump has more of an incentive to go along with them. Still, even if he had more leeway to speak out against the House G.O.P. bill, is there any reason to think he would? The thing always to remember about Trump—and this week has merely confirmed it—is that he is a sham populist. A sham authoritarian populist, even. Going back to late-nineteenth-century Germany, many of the most successful authoritarian populists have expanded the social safety net. Otto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor, introduced health insurance, accident insurance, and old-age pensions. ""The actual complaint of the worker is the insecurity of his existence,"" he said in 1884. ""He is unsure if he will always have work, he is unsure if he will always be healthy, and he can predict that he will reach old age and be unable to work."" During the twentieth century, Argentina's Juan Perón, Malaysia's Tunku Abdul Rahman, and Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew were among the authoritarian leaders who followed Bismarck's example. Today, if you look at the election platform of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, you see something similar. Like Trump, Le Pen is a nativist, a protectionist, and an Islamophobe. But she is not proposing to dismantle any of the many social benefits that the French state provides. Rather, she says she will expand child-support payments and reduce the retirement age to sixty. Trump, on the other hand, has little to offer ordinary Americans except protectionist rhetoric and anti-immigrant measures. Before moving to gut Obamacare, he at least could have tried to bolster his populist credentials by passing a job-creating infrastructure bill or a middle-class tax cut. Instead, he's staked his Presidency on a proposal that would hurt many of his supporters, slash Medicaid, undermine the finances of Medicare, and benefit the donor class. That's not populism: it's the reverse of it. And it might be a political disaster in the making. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Shameful Republican Assault on Medicaid,7951,"In terms of political theatre, Donald Trump’s press conference on Thursday was the event of the week, or maybe the year. Strictly in policy terms, though, it was less important than the media briefing that Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, and other House Republican leaders held, also on Thursday, about their plans to abolish Obamacare and replace it with some version of what we might call Trumpcare, or maybe Trump/Ryancare. There are still huge questions about what this new system will look like, and when it might be enacted. In a new seventeen-page paper, “Obamacare Repeal and Replace,” the G.O.P. lawmakers outlined proposals that are familiar from a plan that Ryan put out last year. They included expanded health savings accounts, financial aid for the establishment of high-risk pools at the state level, and the replacement of income-based subsidies to purchase individual insurance with universal tax credits. But the paper also contained some huge gaps. It didn’t say how large the new tax credits would be, or how they and other elements of the reform would be paid for. To pay for its provisions, the 2010 Affordable Care Act levied more than a trillion dollars in tax increases over a decade. The Republican replacement will, in all likelihood, cover millions fewer people than Obamacare, but it will still have to be paid for. Ryan and his colleagues were largely silent on where the tax burden would fall. For all this deliberate obfuscation, though, House Republicans are now being very clear about one thing: whatever legislation emerges after the Senate and the White House have weighed in, it will almost certainly roll back the Obama Administration’s expansion of Medicaid, the federal health-insurance program for poverty-stricken and low-income households. Under the outline released on Thursday, the current Medicaid system would be replaced by block grants to the states, and the extra federal money that went to Medicaid as part of the A.C.A. would gradually be removed. In effect, the Medicaid expansion would be slowly suffocated. For some reason, this fact has received less attention than other elements of the Republicans’ approach, such as the replacement of subsidies with tax credits. But in many ways the expansion of Medicaid has been Obamacare’s most successful element. Since the start of 2014, more than sixteen million Americans have been added to the rolls of Medicaid and chip, the children's version of the program. That’s more than the roughly 12.7 million people who bought private insurance plans on government-run exchanges in 2016. The expansion was targeted at working families who aren’t officially in poverty but don’t earn enough to buy even subsidized private insurance plans—roughly speaking, these are households earning less than thirty-five thousand dollars a year—and it has been popular, uncontroversial, and cost-effective. Rolling it back would be cruel, and wrong. The top-line numbers don’t even tell the full success story. Insuring people through Medicaid is much cheaper than enrolling them in private insurance: the cost differential is at least twenty-five per cent. So the 2014 Medicaid expansion not only played a key role in reducing the percentage of Americans who don’t have any insurance—from 14.3 per cent, in 2013, to 8.6 per cent, in January to March of last year—it did so in an economically efficient manner. Purely on this basis, you might think that Republicans who claim to like value for money would want to preserve the expansion. But, of course, they don’t. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Why not? In public, they claim Medicaid is too bureaucratic, fraud-plagued, and costly. “On its current path, the Medicaid program is on unsustainable financial footing,” the new G.O.P. paper says. “This is not merely a fiscal issue, but an issue that jeopardizes the ability of federal and state government to take care of the most vulnerable who actually rely on the program.” Although rising health-care costs are a real issue, this argument doesn’t stand up. As health-care programs go, Medicaid is a cheap option, with relatively low costs and low rates of inflation. A recent analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that, if current policies are maintained, federal spending on all health-care programs will go from about 5.5 per cent of G.D.P in 2016 to 8.9 per cent in 2046. That’s a big jump. But the great bulk of the increase will be accounted for by the rising cost of Medicare as the population ages. Spending on the expanded version of Medicaid plus the other elements of Obamacare, if they were preserved, would go from 2.3 per cent of G.D.P. to 3.1 per cent—an eminently manageable increase. Surely the real reason that House Republicans want to roll back the Medicaid expansion is the same reason that nineteen Republican-run states refused to participate in the expansion to begin with. These lawmakers are ideologically opposed to redistributive entitlement programs, and they are in hock to wealthy backers who don’t like paying for them. From this perspective, the fact that the Medicaid reform worked doesn’t justify keeping it: it’s a reason to get rid of it quickly, before public support for it becomes immutable. Republican leaders are only too aware that once programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid get established, trying to get rid of them, or even downsize them, can be politically toxic. In this instance, Ryan and his colleagues appear to be betting that the Medicaid expansion can be safely reversed because it is still relatively new. There’s no assurance they are right, however, particularly because many of the people who stand to lose out are Trump voters. Not all Republican-run states spurned the expansion. Some—such as Arizona, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Ohio—chose to participate. As a result, many residents of these states now have health-care coverage for the first time in their lives. In other places, such as Arkansas and Kentucky, Republican governors have recently taken over from Democrats who approved the Medicaid expansion, and they have kept it in place. In fact, there are now fourteen Republican-run states that stand to lose a great deal if the Medicaid expansion is scrapped. Under the approach outlined on Thursday, Ryan and his colleagues would seek to alleviate this problem by removing the federal funding only gradually, and giving states times to adjust. But this idea is already running into fierce opposition from the Republican states that never expanded their Medicaid programs. Why should their residents continue to pay federal taxes that will go to reward states that played footsie with Obama, some of their representatives are asking. In the words of Mark Sanford, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, there is an “incredible tug of war” on the way. Still, the Republican Party’s internal machinations are a secondary matter. The key point is that G.O.P. leaders are intent on ripping up a successful and affordable reform that helped fill a gaping hole in the social safety net. In the process, they will endanger the health of a lot of Americans who don’t have the resources to protect themselves and their families. And that’s shameful.

Paul Ryan’s Health-Care Vise,8956,"If there is a single person who made Paul Ryan the Speaker of the House, it is probably Mark Meadows. Back in 2015, Meadows, a former restaurant owner who, in 2012, was elected to represent the most conservative district in North Carolina, set into motion the events that led to Speaker John Boehner’s resignation. Meadows, who had no legislative experience, filed an obscure parliamentary procedure known as a motion to vacate that would have forced a referendum on Boehner in the House. Boehner resigned rather than face the prospect of losing that vote, and Ryan emerged as the only Speaker candidate acceptable to all the factions of the House G.O.P. Now it’s Ryan’s turn in the barrel. Last night, Ryan and two House committees released the American Health Care Act, their attempt to make good on the G.O.P.’s promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. It’s not anyone’s idea of a solution to the current flaws in the health-care system, but, rather, a rickety compromise designed to overcome the objections of conservatives like Meadows and several other ideological factions, interest groups, and parliamentary obstacles. The end result is a piece of legislation that critics on the right can credibly attack as too similar to Obamacare for them to support, and those on the left can assail as a giveaway to insurance companies that reduces the numbers of Americans who have coverage and contains no mechanisms to control health-care costs. It is fair to wonder what the point of the bill is at all. Despite all the delicate political calibrations that Ryan made, it still might not pass the House. Meadows is now the head of the Freedom Caucus, a group of some forty right-wing Republicans who when they vote as a bloc can thwart any Republican legislation in the House. As with the majority of House Republicans, most members of the Freedom Caucus have only ever served under a Democratic President. They were elected to oppose Obama and everything he stood for, and they spent most of his Presidency attacking Republican leaders who they believed thwarted those efforts. They have no experience legislating. In this new era of trying to pass bills that a Republican President will sign, the Freedom Caucus is among the first groups that Ryan needed to mollify. Obamacare uses relatively generous government subsidies to help individuals purchase health insurance on the private market. An early version of the Ryan plan replaced these subsidies with less generous refundable tax credits, which many conservatives dislike because Americans who pay no taxes would still be eligible for the credits. Meadows and several other Republicans attacked the idea as a new entitlement. Ryan’s response in the plan released last night was to scale back the tax credits for wealthier Americans. It didn’t work. Representative Jim Jordan, of Ohio, one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, told Politico, “This is Obamacare by a different form.” Later today, the group is scheduled to hold a press conference pillorying Ryan’s plan. Ryan’s problems are not just on his right. The other major mechanism Obamacare used to increase the total number of insured Americans was a large expansion of those eligible for Medicaid. Many Republican governors accepted a generous offer of federal money to expand the Medicaid rolls in their states, and after seven years of using the funds they don’t want a disruptive reversal that would cause millions of people to lose health insurance. In the Senate, four Republicans wrote a letter yesterday demanding that some version of the Obama Administration’s Medicaid expansion be included in any repeal bill. Several Republican governors have been lobbying President Trump for the same thing. Ryan’s response was to leave the expansion in place until 2020, a decision that, like the tax credits, is already being attacked by the right as retaining a crucial element of Obamacare. Proponents of the Medicaid expansion see the deadline as creating a health-insurance time bomb that will detonate in a few years. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Health-care reform has long been stymied by the insurance industry. Bill and Hillary Clinton took on the industry in 1994 and were badly defeated. In 2009, Obama decided to buy the industry off by including a provision forcing every American to buy its product—the dreaded individual mandate. The mandate helped insurers afford Obamacare’s new regulations, which required that children be allowed to remain on their parents’ plans until age twenty-six and that Americans with preëexisting medical conditions not be denied coverage. Ryan and Trump have insisted that they would keep those popular regulations while killing the mandate, which forces the uninsured to pay a tax penalty. Their solution is that the uninsured would pay a penalty to insurance companies. Specifically, insurers would be allowed to charge anyone with a two-month gap in coverage up to a thirty-per-cent surcharge on a new policy. For many Americans, the surcharge under Trumpcare could end up being more than the current tax penalty under Obamacare. (If the new surcharge wasn’t enough of a sweetener for the industry, tucked into the bill is a tax break for insurance-company executives who make more than five hundred thousand dollars per year, a proposal that will be shredded by Democrats and Republicans alike.) Finally, the Ryan plan was designed to navigate the Scylla and Charybdis of the congressional budgeting process. When Lyndon Johnson created Medicare, he essentially made up and lowballed the long-term costs of the program. Without a true estimate, it was difficult for fiscal conservatives, medical groups, and other opponents to attack the plan, and it sailed through Congress. In the seventies, Congress mandated a rigorous process to estimate the costs of new legislation and created the Congressional Budget Office, which “scores” all bills. In 2009, Obama became so frustrated by the C.B.O., whose cost estimates had an enormous impact on the health-care debate, that during an Oval Office meeting he said he didn’t want to hear the C.B.O. mentioned, so his aides referred to it as “banana.” The Ryan plan was released yesterday and is scheduled to be marked up in two House committees tomorrow, long before the C.B.O. can analyze it. That means the most basic information about the plan—how much it costs and how many people will gain or lose insurance—will be unknown before voting on it begins. The new budget system created in the seventies also set up the obscure parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation, which in the Senate is not subject to a filibuster. Using reconciliation, the Ryan plan can clear the Senate with fifty votes rather than the usual sixty. But reconciliation was not intended to be used for major legislation outside of budgets, and a Senate rule prohibits using reconciliation to make policy changes that aren’t strictly about raising or lowering government revenue. Ryan needed to shape a bill that would survive this process, and as a result he left out some of conservatives’ most long-standing health-care-policy ideas. (For instance, most conservatives support changing a law that prevents insurance from being sold across state lines, arguing that it would make markets more competitive and bring down costs, but Ryan didn’t include the change in his plan.) Forced to navigate House Republican politics, the lobbying pressure from the insurance industry, and the obscure rules of the budgeting process, Ryan has produced a bill that nobody would ever propose as a sane solution to the problems with Obamacare. Its only chance is speed. If Ryan can rush and muscle it through the House and Mitch McConnell can do the same in the Senate, it might end up on Trump’s desk. But the more scrutiny this House bill is subjected to, the more likely it is to share the fate of most efforts at health-care reform and die somewhere on its journey to the Senate, and perhaps long before then. If his health-care-reform effort fails, Ryan himself may not survive as the House leader. Meadows and his colleagues catapulted Ryan to the Speakership, and they still have the power to bring him down. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Paul Ryan’s Craven Pact with Donald Trump,8146,"On Tuesday morning, at about the time that Donald Trump was casually threatening to destroy the career of a Texas state senator who had objected to laws regarding the forfeiture of property from drug suspects, House Speaker Paul Ryan and his colleagues in the House Republican leadership held their weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. Ryan began by talking about Republican efforts to roll back “excessive regulation”—which is killing jobs, he claimed—and then he moved on to the Affordable Care Act. Blithely ignoring the recent announcement that 9.6 million people have signed up for coverage this year on the private insurance exchanges set up by the law, the Speaker declared that he and his colleagues had decided ""to rescue the American health-care system from the collapse that is coming because of Obamacare."" Moving ""step by step,"" he said, the Republicans would replace the current reform with ""a much better system, a patient-centered health-care system"" that is ""far better for families, far better for patients."" Ryan then took questions. This was the first one: ""The President made some new false statements yesterday, notably that there are major terrorist attacks that the media, essentially, isn't covering. Are you getting concerned at all about his grasp of the truth?"" Ryan shrugged his shoulders. Since Election Day, he has been very careful in his responses to Trump's controversial statements, sometimes ignoring them, sometimes downplaying them, and often adopting the mantra that he doesn't comment on the tweet of the moment. But this latest Trump lie didn't come in a tweet; the President said it during a speech to U.S. troops at a military base in Tampa. Evidently, Ryan felt he had to say something, even if he sounded even more craven than usual. ""Look,'' he said. ""I'm going to do my job. I'll let you guys do yours with respect to how you report, or what you don't report. The problem is we do have a war on terror in front of us. We do have isis trying to conduct terror attacks across the globe. This is a real serious problem. And what I am focussed on is doing our job and making sure our law-enforcement authorities, our military, have the tools to keep us safe."" Of course, Ryan hadn't answered the question. His inquisitor pressed him again: ""Are you worried that it hurts our credibility around the world?"" Again, Ryan shrugged it off. ""I can't speak to whether or not you are over- or underreporting something,"" he said. ""That is your job. I'll stick with doing mine."" The next question was about Trump's attacks on Judge James L. Robart, the federal judge in Washington State who issued a temporary freeze on the President’s anti-Muslim travel ban. ""Look, we respect an independent judiciary. This is a separate branch of government,"" Ryan said. But, after this promising start, he made an attempt to normalize Trump's statements. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? ""Look, he is not the first President to get frustrated with a ruling from a court,"" Ryan said. ""I think what is most important are the actions. This Administration is honoring the ruling, and this Administration is going through the proper procedures to deal with the ruling—to try and get the ruling overturned. They are going through the appeals process.... Look, I know he's an unconventional President. He gets frustrated with judges. We get frustrated with judges. But he's respecting the process, and I think that’s what counts at the end of the day."" It is perhaps worth recalling what, specifically, Trump said about Judge Robart. He didn't merely vent his frustration that one of his edicts had been challenged. Two days in a row, he attacked Judge Robart personally on Twitter. On Saturday morning, he referred to Robart as a ""so-called judge"" and said his ruling was ""ridiculous."" Later that day, he broadened his attack, and appeared to question the authority of courts more generally. ""What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into US?"" Trump wrote. And he didn't leave it there. On Sunday evening, he said, in yet another tweet, ""The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy."" And he went on, ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system."" Last July, when Trump attacked Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge who was presiding over a Trump University lawsuit, and claimed that Curiel had a conflict of interest because of his ""Mexican heritage,"" Ryan called foul. ""Look, the comment about the judge the other day just was out of left field, for my mind,"" Ryan told an interviewer. ""It's reasoning I don't relate to. I completely disagree with the thinking behind that."" Ryan didn't stop there. After noting that Trump ""clearly says things I do not agree with, and I've had to speak up from time to time when that happens,"" he promised to do the same thing going forward, if it were necessary. Evidently, the spectacle of a sitting President—not merely a Presidential candidate—tearing into a federal judge who has blocked one of his initiatives, and suggesting that he should be blamed for future terrorist attacks, didn't rise to the standards of ""necessary"" in Ryan's mind. Why could that be, do you think? On Tuesday, after dismissing Trump's comments about Robart, Ryan returned to the issue of repealing and replacing Obamacare, saying that legislation would be passed by the end of this year, although he acknowledged that the actual implementation of the reforms to the reform could take longer. When a questioner asked what the new health-care system would look like, he referred her to ""the plan we ran on in 2016”—by which he meant his own plan, which goes under the name ""A Better Way.” ""That's what I think you should take a look at,"" he said. This was another statement that bears inspection. Last month, Trump promised that his replacement for Obamacare would provide ""insurance for everybody."" The Ryan plan, however, does not even pretend to be a universal-coverage plan. It replaces subsidies for purchasing insurance plans with less generous tax rebates, hacks away at Medicaid, and junks the principle that insurers must treat the sick and healthy alike. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Health & Economy, Ryan’s plan would lead to about four million fewer Americans getting coverage than under the current law. (Other estimates for the losses in coverage under Ryan's plan are higher.) Ryan didn't point out any of this, of course. It's an open secret in Washington that he and his colleagues intend to ignore Trump's statements about covering everybody and proceed with a version of Ryan's proposal that may well end up including elements from other Republican blueprints that are kicking around on Capitol Hill. ""We do have plans—our committees are busy, under way, doing this,"" Ryan said. ""And we hope to get this done as fast as possible."" He refuses to criticize the President's statements, no matter how outrageous they are, and pushes ahead with conservative policies that have been part of the G.O.P.'s agenda for years. Could the terms of the pact that Ryan has made with Trump be any clearer? By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"On Health Care, We’ll Have What Congress Is Having",6733,"In the fall of 1994, the Clinton Administration’s much debated comprehensive, and complicated, health-insurance bill—known derisively as Hillarycare—died quietly on Capitol Hill. It was a moment that, the Princeton sociologist Paul Starr later argued, would “go down as one of the great lost political opportunities in American history.” But, before the end, talk of another approach kept bubbling up: to allow those Americans who couldn’t get insurance elsewhere to buy a policy that was just as good, and inexpensive, as what members of Congress got. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy, of Massachusetts, said that Americans should get “exactly what we have,” he meant the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The F.E.H.B.P., as it’s known, was started in 1959, a few years before Medicare, and was meant to cover some nine million government employees—civil-service workers, the courts, the Post Office, members of Congress, and more. It wasn’t a single plan but, rather, as a Times story put it, “a supermarket offering 300 private health plans.” (Even the right-learning Heritage Foundation called it “a showcase of consumer choice and free-market competition.”) One may get a sense of its scope and inclusiveness—its supermarket-ness—in the way that the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the program, explains it to federal employees. Much of the program—for instance, the idea that no one can be refused, or charged more, for a preëxisting condition, or that dependents under twenty-six are covered—will sound familiar to anyone conversant with the most attractive parts of the Affordable Care Act. In the summer of 1994, when the Clinton Administration struggled to win approval for its proposal, there were some signs of actual good will in Congress, along with the predictable determination to dynamite the whole idea. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, wanted any insurer who sold policies to federal workers to offer the same thing to “civilians,” at a reasonable price. Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican and the Minority Leader, favored a scheme in which self-employed individuals and small businesses (employers of up to fifty workers) could buy the federal policy “at the same premium price.” There were several variations of this approach. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Then it all went bad, as it had gone bad since the days of the New Deal. Newt Gingrich, who was then the deputy Minority Leader of the House, warned President Clinton that he was endangering his entire agenda in the pursuit of health-care reform—in particular, Gingrich insisted that Clinton was risking a global trade agreement that was probably never in danger. (Someone probably can still explain that era’s excitement over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or gatt.) Dole by then had given up, and so had Congressman John Dingell, of Michigan, a Democrat, who had been pushing health-care reform since 1955 but eventually said that it was “time to give health-care reform a decent burial and provide for its rebirth.” Two months later, in the midterm elections, Democrats, although they managed to cling to the Senate, lost the House by the widest margin since the midterms of 1946; Gingrich was elected Speaker on the strength of his “Contract with America,” which made a number of promises that were impossible to keep, and in the process launched an era of rabid partisanship. The failure of health-care reform showed mostly that Democrats were a pushover party, with few sounding like Senator Bob Kerrey, of Nebraska, who said, “I’m not elected to read the polls and say the public wants me to give up.” The “rebirth” for which Dingell hoped would only come a decade and a half later, with the passage, in 2010, of the Affordable Care Act. For all its flaws, bumbled launch, and absence of Republican support, the A.C.A. has provided health insurance to some twenty million Americans who didn’t have it before. Republicans have been venomously eager to dismantle it ever since. Late last week, the Senate took a big step in that direction by passing a budget “blueprint” that will make it easy for Congress, controlled by Republicans, to repeal the act. If it’s sometimes hard to understand what makes Republican legislators so angry, here is a theory: their fury may not stem from some ungraspable principle, or hatred of President Obama’s historic victory (or of Obama himself), but, rather, from something personal, and selfish. Under the A.C.A., members of Congress, and congressional staff, among other Capitol Hill employees, were no longer eligible for the F.E.H.B.P. In the chilly language of government directives, the Office of Personnel Management Web site said that “Section 1312 of the Affordable Care Act requires that Members of Congress and their official staff obtain coverage by health plans created under the Affordable Care Act or coverage offered via an Affordable Insurance Exchange.” Ouch! In other words, the comfortable choices that were available for more than fifty years were suddenly transferred to the slightly murky passageways of Obamacare. And it follows that, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, members of Congress would be able to return to the federal plan that they, like millions of federal employees, were so fond of. Twenty million other Americans won’t. A better idea, though, might be to find a path (it won’t be easy, but it’s certainly easier than anything else that might be effective and that hundreds of legislators could ever agree upon) to finally offer the beloved, and by most accounts well-administered, federal plan to the rest of the uninsured nation. We can almost hear America demanding, “We want what they’re having.” If Congress is serious about repealing, and replacing, the act, then that’s the sort of replacement that almost anyone could live with.

A Play About Roe v. Wade That Is a Parable of an Exclusionary Women’s Movement,8095,"It is feminists’ perennial fear: when liberal values are under assault, the left’s first concession to the center will be women’s most controversial right. Thus the consternation when, earlier this month, the organizers of the Women’s March on Washington, D.C., allowed an anti-abortion-rights group to sign on as a co-sponsor of the event, and the relief when, days later, organizers removed the group after receiving an outraged response. The march took pains to make its feminism expansive—to emphasize that equality for womankind can’t be achieved without equality for all the other marginalized groups of which women are part—but there was, thankfully, no room on its platform for hemming and hawing about whether opposing abortion can be a pro-woman stance. As a sea of pink-hatted protesters flooded downtown Washington on Saturday, hand-painted signs declaring “Abortion Is Healthcare” bobbed above the tide, and chants of “My body, my choice” rippled along Pennsylvania Avenue. A day later, a mile south of the National Mall, out-of-town marchers took their seats beside well-heeled locals to see a new play that asks why the right to abortion remains, perpetually, up for debate. (One of Donald Trump’s first acts as President was to expand and reinstate the so-called Mexico City Policy, which withholds U.S. aid from international organizations that so much as mention abortion.) It had been forty-four years, to the day, since the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. When Washington’s Arena Stage announced, last February, that it would stage “Roe,” written by Lisa Loomer and commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, it seemed the production would coincide with another historic moment: a fiercely pro-choice woman’s ascension to the nation’s highest office. Instead, on the weekend of Trump’s Inauguration, the play, and the audience’s enthusiastic response, seemed to symbolize the ways in which both the city of Washington and the broader culture are looking to the past for lessons in resistance. The play follows the two women who made Roe v. Wade a reality, showing how the famous case was argued and won—and how it has been ceaselessly relitigated ever since. Sarah Weddington (Sarah Jane Agnew), the attorney, was just twenty-six years old when the case reached the nation’s highest court, and Norma McCorvey (Sara Bruner), the rootless, penniless lesbian plaintiff, was even younger when she became famous under the pseudonym Jane Roe. Since then, Weddington has continued to defend the right to abortion—in court, in the Texas legislature, and as an adviser to President Jimmy Carter—while McCorvey has changed teams, courting notoriety with a string of religious conversions (first to evangelical Christianity, then to Roman Catholicism) and a widely publicized recantation of her history-making role. In Loomer’s play, McCorvey’s spurned partner asserts, “Norma wasn’t pro-choice or pro-life. She was just pro-Norma.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Janelle Monáe on Growing Up Queer and Black Loomer has said that she aimed to air all sides of the abortion debate, and the play passes the microphone among a broad cast of characters, including Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, who authored the decision; the evangelical minister Flip Benham, who briefly recruited McCorvey to Operation Rescue, the extremist group accused of conspiring in violence against abortion providers; and the imagined women in a clinic waiting room, whose emotions run the gamut from moral torment to nonchalance. The play is nuanced on the decision to have an abortion, bullish on the right to choose. The latter proved a crowd-pleaser at Sunday’s show, where I saw a pair of theatregoers in Ohio Women’s March T-shirts, and spotted a few pink knitted “pussyhats” in the standing room at the back. (Only four per cent of D.C. residents voted for Trump.) By the play’s second act, the atmosphere in the theatre had taken on some of the charge of the previous day’s rally, and the cast was pausing frequently to accommodate applause. The audience sprang to its feet after the last line, spoken in unison by Weddington and McCorvey: “As of this moment, with the Supreme Court behind us, Roe still stands.” The emotional heart of “Roe,” however, isn’t the face-off between pro- and anti-abortion forces but the tension between the women’s movement—represented by Weddington—and McCorvey, its less-than-empowered instrument. The play begins with the two principals embarking on competing versions of their shared story, and pauses often to confront the differences in their accounts. The most disturbing one concerns the women’s very first meeting, in 1970, at a pizza parlor in Dallas, where Weddington, who has been searching for the right plaintiff, pitches McCorvey on playing the part. Did Weddington gloss over the time a case like this would take, as McCorvey claims, allowing the twenty-two-year-old, who was pregnant for the third time, to believe that a legal victory could win her the abortion she sought? Or, as Weddington insists, did a fully informed McCorvey agree to be part of something larger than herself? Though the play paints McCorvey as by far the less reliable narrator, a shadow of discomfort lingers. McCorvey never got her abortion—the baby, like her previous two, was ultimately adopted. In the nineteen-nineties, Weddington published an autobiography which revealed that she herself had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border to undergo the procedure as a law student. Loomer imagines that McCorvey would have been incensed by this disclosure. “If you wanted to help me get the abortion, why didn’t you just tell me where you had yours?” McCorvey asks in the play. “You had the money. I didn’t. You didn’t care about Roe, the person; you only cared about Roe, the case.” Roe, the case, has benefitted millions of women, but that doesn’t take the sting out of McCorvey’s charge. Poor women are too often treated as props by a women’s movement that propels the affluent, educated Weddingtons of the world. Thanks to Republican efforts to roll back Roe_—_shuttering abortion clinics across the country, forcing women to travel long distances for the procedure, and imposing lengthy waiting periods and other costly obstacles—well-off women remain the only ones who can count on getting an abortion today. The worst harms fall on women of color, women in rural areas—and, more broadly, women in conservative-held states. A modern-day McCorvey, in deep-red Texas, might find herself more or less where she would have in 1970. In this sense, “Roe” offers a remarkably fitting parable for the present women’s resistance. The landmark court case is, in the play’s telling, a victory for women that left the woman at its center feeling bitterly excluded. At the march on Saturday, many signs bore a quote by the writer Audre Lorde: “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.” Reproductive rights are the bread and butter of any women’s movement: feminism that doesn’t support women’s bodily self-determination is not feminism at all. But there’s no point, and never has been, in talking about the politics of abortion without talking about race, class, sexuality, and the other intersecting forms of power that separate women from one another. According to Loomer’s play, that truth has come down to us from the complicated triumph of Jane Roe, tangled up in our essential right to choose.

Could Obamacare Save the Democrats?,8561,"You Know Who was back on Twitter Thursday morning, and for the second day running he addressed the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act—a venture that is already threatening to turn into a political disaster for the G.O.P., and a much-needed lifeline for the Democrats. “The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in,” President-elect Donald Trump said, in a series of tweets. “Instead of working to fix it, they . . . do the typical political thing and blame. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning. ‘Keep you doctor, keep your plan!’ It is . . . time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works—much less expensive & far better!” In parsing this latest Trump outburst, a bit of context helps. During the Presidential campaign, Trump adopted the standard Republican line on the Affordable Care Act—that it was a mess that needed replacing—even as he also expressed support for some of the law’s provisions, such as the one that prevents insurers from shunning people with preëxisting conditions. Since the election, however, two things that should already have been obvious have become impossible to ignore, even for Trump. For one thing, neither he nor the Republican Party has a viable replacement to offer for the A.C.A. And congressional Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Minority Leader, have no intention of helping them out. On Wednesday morning, Schumer, also on Twitter, said, “Republicans should stop clowning around with America’s health care. Don’t #MakeAmericaSickAgain.” Schumer’s jab coincided with a visit to Capitol Hill by Mike Pence, the Vice-President-elect, during which Pence said that repealing and replacing the A.C.A. was the incoming Administration’s first order of business. As an initial step, Senate Republicans, who have an effective majority of four seats in the new chamber, recently passed a procedural resolution that could enable them to repeal key parts of the A.C.A. with just fifty-one votes, thereby avoiding a Democratic filibuster. This means a number of key elements of the law could be demolished, or slated for demolition. They include the employer and individual mandates; the federal subsidies for insurance policies purchased on government-run exchanges; the expansion of Medicaid to households that are living slightly above the poverty line; and the taxes on wealthy households that were imposed to help pay for the reform. Republican leaders are considering pushing through legislation to gut Obamacare of these components straight away, but delaying implementation for a period—perhaps two or three years—while they devise a new system to replace it. The problems with this “repeal and delay” strategy are obvious and unavoidable. Once the repeal legislation was passed, more than twenty million Americans would face the prospect of losing their health-care coverage. (This figure comes from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed the likely impact of an anti-Obamacare bill that Republicans passed in 2015, which President Obama vetoed.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   Most of those who would lose out would be individuals and families of modest means, many of them living in the blue or blue-ish states that expanded Medicaid under the law. (Many red states refused to accept the Medicaid expansion.) A cynical student of history might suggest that the Republican Party could afford to ignore these blue-state folks. But the socioeconomic base of the G.O.P. has shifted, and, according to a back-of-an-envelope calculation by Paul Krugman, about 5.5 million of the victims of repealing the A.C.A. would be Trump supporters. In many parts of the country, large numbers of white households subsist on incomes low enough to make them eligible for Medicaid or hefty subsidies to buy private insurance. We didn’t hear much from this group during the campaign, but that would surely change if the Medicaid expansion and the subsidies were both eliminated. In addition to harming large numbers of Trump voters, repealing most of the A.C.A. would enrage some rich and powerful economic interests that the Republican Party has traditionally courted, such as doctors, hospitals, and insurers. It took the American health-care industry, which is now bigger than the entire economy of France, half a decade to prepare for and implement the law’s provisions. Many working in health care believe it would be folly to destroy the new system before building a proper replacement. Insurers are warning that a “repeal and delay” plan would create immediate turmoil on the government-run exchanges, many of which are already having trouble attracting more than one or two insurers to participate. Last month, two big trade groups—the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals—warned publicly that repealing the A.C.A. could cost hospitals a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars and trigger an “unprecedented public health crisis.” In a letter to Congress on Tuesday, Dr. James Madara, the chief executive of the American Medical Association, said, “We believe that before any action is taken . . . policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies.” No wonder Trump is concerned. Having campaigned as an economic populist who would focus his efforts on jobs and trade, he now runs the risk of getting embroiled in a battle over health care that could conceivably overshadow everything else he does. “Some Republicans think they can repeal ObamaCare and blame Mr. Obama for the fallout, but they are kidding themselves,” the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, which itself has been a vehement opponent of the A.C.A., noted on Thursday. “Republicans were elected on a promise to repeal and replace, and the statute of limitations on blaming Mr. Obama will soon expire.” It’s looking more and more like the Republicans are caught in a trap of their own making. Ever since 2008, they and their media outriders, such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, have demagogued the health-care issue in an outrageous fashion. Trump, in running for President, employed the same nihilistic strategy. Now they may pay for it. Despite the Republicans’ vague talk of stripping away government bureaucracy and setting up a more “market-based system” to replace Obamacare, there is no quick fix, no cheap way out. In a private health-care market, the only way to guarantee universal, or near universal, coverage is to employ mandates, subsidies, taxes, and legal directives—the very tools employed in the A.C.A. At some point, presumably, the Trump Administration and the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill will cobble together some sort of proposal. In all likelihood, it will feature lower-quality insurance plans, large deductibles, and hefty payments to insurers to cover high-risk patients. But the congressional sponsors of such a plan could end up being held hostage by the same Democrats they have been tormenting for years. Even if the Republicans succeed in gutting the A.C.A. with fifty-one votes in the Senate, they will need sixty votes to pass a replacement, which means they will need help. No wonder Schumer looks so chipper—a bit too chipper, perhaps, for someone whose party recently squandered an opportunity to win a majority. On Thursday morning, shortly after Trump’s latest Twitter barrage, the Brooklynite held a press conference, at which he stood next to a whiteboard with the words “make america sick again” emblazoned on it. Asked about Trump labelling him a clown, Schumer replied, “I’d say to the President-elect that this is serious, serious stuff. People’s health is at stake and people’s lives are at stake. . . . Instead of calling names, the President-elect should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Trump and the Case of Congressional Ethics,6308,"How much does Donald Trump care about congressional ethics? The principles at stake can’t bother him much, it’s reasonable to say, given the choices that he has made so far regarding his own conflicts, and in a hundred other areas. That is what congressional Republicans may have guessed when, late in the evening of Monday, a federal holiday, they made the dismantling of the Office of Congressional Ethics the first order of business for their new term. So much during the election year had pushed the limits of self-parody, so why shouldn’t they? For about eighteen hours, it looked like a triumph for legalized graft. Under the new measure, the ethics office would not be independent, would not be allowed to talk to the press, would not be able to do, really, anything. And the Republicans who had pushed their caucus to back it, led by Representative Robert Goodlatte, of Virginia, had done so in a closed meeting with no warning, as part of a package of rules changes. The G.O.P. representatives were absolutely correct in thinking that the Trump years are shaping up to be a bitter farce, in terms of good government, and a tragedy in other ways—bereft, for example, of real efforts to improve the lives of the most vulnerable Americans. What they were confused about was the part that they are expected to play. This became clear on Monday night, as critics from all sides pelted the congressmen with their own absurdity, and, the next morning, when Trump began to tweet. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it,” Trump began, continuing in a second tweet, “may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! ‪#DTS.”  “DTS” stands for “Drain the swamp,” one of the companion chants to “Lock her up!” during the Presidential campaign. It hasn’t been looking all that drained. What’s most telling about Trump’s tweet, and the possible source of the congressmen’s confusion, is that Trump is not objecting to the idea of “weakening” the watchdogs; he is just annoyed that the congressional Republicans are doing it on what he considers to be his time. They don’t have their priorities straight. This is not an office that would ever go after him, so why are they wasting his political capital crippling it? In the world as seen from Trump Tower, that’s practically political embezzlement. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? A couple of hours after Trump tweeted, the Republican conference met again, in what Politico described as an “emergency meeting” called by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and, for now, abandoned the plan. Reportedly, the ethics-gutting embarrassed McCarthy and Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House; supposedly, Ryan (who was reëlected as Speaker on Tuesday) had never liked the idea, at least behind closed doors, though on Tuesday morning he claimed that it would leave Congress as ethical as ever, for whatever that’s worth. So how did it get as far as it did? The partisanship in the House is such that what counts, generally, is simply who gets the majority when the Republicans meet as a caucus—the majority of the majority—which the Party is then expected to get behind. This meant that the ethics-rule change looked like a done deal because Republicans alone favored including it in that rules package by a margin of 119–74. (A number of Democrats, some of whom have their own ethical problems, might have favored the measure, too.) That is no reason to feel sorry for Ryan, who has lived by and fortified this culture. There were moments during the campaign when Ryan was critical of Trump. But in its last days he campaigned for Trump by name. Ryan seems to have his own gold-painted fantasies of what that means. He talks frequently about how much “Donald” likes his ideas. If, in his focus on getting Trump’s help in dismantling the safety net, he let himself be exposed to a day of humiliation, he can’t be surprised. Nor does he deserve much credit for his late effort, with the reversal of the rule change, to salvage his dignity. Indeed, by doing it so quickly after the Trump tweets he has made himself look all the more like the President-elect’s messenger, or maybe his intern. One mystery of all this is how the Republicans could have been so foolish—so conspicuous—given the populist rhetoric they themselves benefitted from in the past election. But when politicians become too used to saying things that they don't believe, it becomes easy for them to forget that members of the public might actually be dismayed. And if they thought that Trump would cover for them, and help make them look good, the picture is that much more pathetic. (Chris Christie, now slumping in his office in Trenton, seems to have believed that, too.) Maybe, looking at the way business is done in the Tower, the congressional Republicans imagined that they might have a role like that ascribed to Trump’s adult children, seeking out the projects they liked and then bringing them to him for a wave of the hand. They may have thought that, when they smiled at his speeches, they’d shimmer a little, like Ivanka. Or maybe they thought that they’d be like his foreign partners, paying a modest fee to license the Trump name, using it to bring the locals into the golf course and keeping the serious money for themselves. They appear to have been wrong. In this case, they were the low-level Atlantic City contractors, sending a bill to Manhattan for the electrical work, having eagerly helped to build something bankrupt, and not even getting paid.

"With Health-Care Reform, Listen Carefully to Trump’s Words",8774,"During the Presidential campaign, one of the consistent policy positions held by candidate Donald Trump was that he would, as his Web site puts it, “immediately deliver a full repeal” of the Affordable Care Act, more familiarly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that will use “free market principles . . . that will broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.” On Sunday, however, when Trump appeared on “60 Minutes,” he surprised many when he said he would keep some of Obamacare in place, particularly its guarantee of health insurance regardless of any preëxisting medical conditions. Trump’s official transition Web site doesn’t provide much clarity as to how he will deliver on this promise; the policies described there—and not just those related to health care, but also to defense, taxation, immigration—are still in the vague phase. The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in a giddy interview on Fox News’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,” essentially suggested that Trump would turn to Ryan’s long-standing agenda for America, especially when it comes to health care. Ryan has drafted several health-care proposals over the years, all of which have the goal of reducing the amount of money the federal government spends to cover health costs. Ryan’s plans, while much more detailed than Trump’s, are not fully formed, but both he and Trump have said they expect health-care reform to be among the first actions of the new Administration. Some Republicans have suggested that Congress could pass a law and present it to Trump on January 20, 2017, the first day of his Administration, making a repeal of Obamacare effective one or two years down the road. If that happens, it will begin a lengthy process in which congressional staff, lobbyists, advocates for patients and providers, and White House officials negotiate the technical details. The language used to discuss these changes will, often, be technical or obfuscating, following a seeming unwritten rule that health-care legislation must be drafted with the maximum number of acronyms and technical terms. So, as the discussion of what will happen to the Affordable Care Act proceeds, it’s important to focus on what the words used to discuss the reforms actually mean. When you hear “preëxisting conditions,” ask about underwriting. Trump made at least some skeptics happy when he said that he planned to keep one of the most popular provisions of Obamacare, the guarantee of coverage for all, regardless of any preëxisting conditions. This may sound easy, but it’s anything but. Obamacare not only requires coverage for those with preëxisting conditions, it also guarantees that everyone will pay the same premiums regardless of his health status. So, for example, if you have diabetes, your insurance premium won’t be higher than a person who lives in the same state and is of the same age but doesn’t have diabetes. This was one of the essential and revolutionary transformations made by Obamacare, and it is why there is a much more vibrant—if troubled—independent health-insurance marketplace for people who don’t get coverage through their jobs. Previously, in many states, insurers charged each person a risk-adjusted premium based on his or her health history. The process of evaluating the risk of patients and charging them accordingly is called underwriting, and if Trump allows underwriting, insurance will be so expensive for people with some preëxisting conditions that it will be unobtainable. Guaranteeing coverage to all but charging each person individually is, effectively, the same as refusing coverage to those with any history of cancer, chronic disease, life-altering accidents, or other health issues. Sure, you are guaranteed coverage, but it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" When you hear “ban on underwriting,” ask about mandates. If Trump and Congress do ban individual underwriting, guaranteeing that everyone can get insurance and pay the same premium, the question is whether there’s a mechanism that requires healthy people to sign up along with the sick. New York State offers the classic example of the disaster that can unfold when insurance companies are prohibited from underwriting individuals, but individuals are free to opt out of insurance. Economists call it adverse selection. Sick people, the ones most likely to use health care, sign up first, which forces the insurance companies to raise premiums so that their health-care costs will be covered. Healthy people, especially the young, refuse to pay these high premiums and are not covered at all. Health insurance becomes wildly expensive and rare. The solution in Obamacare was the mandate, which required all citizens to have some form of insurance. Many of the challenges facing Obamacare stem from the fact that too few young and healthy people signed up for policies—even with the mandate. (The law tried to whack people with penalties if they didn’t sign up, but that didn’t work as effectively as expected.) In criticizing Obamacare, Trump has singled out the mandate as the most pernicious aspect of the law, but he hasn’t explained how, if there is no mandate, he would insure affordable coverage for people with preëxisting conditions. When you hear “vouchers,” ask how their value will be determined. Ryan’s most radical plans for reforming health care involve Medicare. Currently, Medicare provides insurance to tens of millions of people, most of them over sixty-five. Its benefits rise in rough proportion to the cost of the care they receive. Ryan proposes a system in which Medicare recipients receive vouchers—essentially, cash payments—to cover their health-care premiums. In past proposals, Ryan has suggested that the vouchers be set at specific dollar amounts that have no relationship to the cost of health care. Health-care costs have risen far faster than inflation for years (although the pace of increase slowed considerably since Obamacare was enacted). Under Ryan’s plans, people who have Medicare would have to cover a rapidly growing share of their care out of their own pockets. How the voucher amount is calculated will determine whether Medicare continues to be a program that insures that older Americans will have reliable, affordable health insurance, or if it will become an unaffordable luxury for the wealthy. When you hear “block grants,” ask how state legislatures will protect the poor. Another major transformation of health-care funding would come from Ryan’s proposal to eliminate federal grants to states and replace them with block grants. Much health coverage for the poor goes through state-administered Medicaid programs, with funding provided by the federal government. As health-care costs increase, the federal government automatically sends more money to the states. Ryan would replace this system with one in which the federal government provides a block grant that only rises with over-all inflation, not with the cost of health care, which rises faster than inflation. As health-care costs increase, each state government will be left with a difficult choice. It can redirect funding from other state functions, it can raise taxes, or it can reduce benefits for the poor. This could likely lead to wide disparities in the quality and affordability of health care for poor people in different states. If the differences are stark enough, it’s easy to imagine many poor people moving from less generous states to those offering greater coverage. As a nation, we decided with the passage of Obamacare that every citizen should get some degree of health care, regardless of past health history or lack of money. This means we need to subsidize the poor, the sick, and the risky, and the core question in any program is how big that subsidy will be. There are two simple questions to ask of any policy: How will older people, sick people, and the poor receive care under this plan? How much of the rising cost of health care will they have to cover?

What New York City’s Biggest School Reformer Sees in Donald Trump,10849,"Last Wednesday, Eva Moskowitz, the founder of the Success Academy charter-school network, met with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan. Moskowitz’s schools are known for their stratospheric test scores and strict discipline. Trump was said to be considering her for the job of Secretary of Education. The next day, Moskowitz held a press conference, where she announced that she would not be joining Trump’s Administration but that she nevertheless felt hopeful about his Presidency. “I’m troubled by what I see as a sort of rooting for Trump’s failure, because that is rooting for our own failure,” she told reporters assembled in front of New York’s City Hall. “There are many positive signs that President Trump will be different from candidate Trump.” What does a leader in the self-described progressive, anti-racist education-reform movement see in Trump to feel positive about? Success Academy schools serve fourteen thousand children in New York City, the majority of whom are black, Latino, or low income. Moskowitz herself voted for Hillary Clinton. After Election Day, Moskowitz sent a letter to her staff acknowledging that many of the families of students in their schools “will feel very deeply and very directly that they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump’s campaign.” I called Moskowitz on Sunday morning to ask her how she thought Trump could help the charter-school movement, and what she had heard from the President-elect that led her to believe he would change. (The conversation took place before Wednesday’s announcement that Trump had picked Betsy DeVos, a Republican school-choice philanthropist, to be his Secretary of Education.) “I’m an American historian by training, and I’ve cited this example: Lyndon Johnson spent thirty years fighting against civil rights, and then became the President who passed the most sweeping civil-rights legislation this country has ever seen,” she said. “Often, governing is different from running. Look, I’m an optimistic person. I wouldn’t be educating children if I did not believe in human potential.” Not all education reformers share Moskowitz’s optimism. On the day of her press conference, Democrats For Education Reform, another central player in the national charter-school movement, released a statement urging its allies not to work for Trump. “A child who is homeless; a child without access to food or healthcare; a child whose parent cannot find steady work; a child whose dad is locked up for years on low-level drug offenses—each of these situations dramatically compromise the life chances of our children,” D.F.E.R.’s president, Shavar Jeffries, said. “The policies and rhetoric of President-elect Trump run contrary to the most fundamental values of what it means to be a progressive committed to educating our kids and strengthening our families and communities.” Moskowitz told me that she disagreed with Jeffries. “I believe in bipartisanship,” she said. She and Trump share a commitment to school choice and an antipathy toward teachers’ unions. I asked her if she had spoken to Trump about how the mass deportations he’s called for could affect her students from immigrant families. She declined to share details of their conversation, but replied, “There are so many issues that I would need a month-long meeting. There are issues having to do with mental health for adolescents, which is inadequate. Many of our parents are victims of domestic violence. There are housing issues, immigration issues. The list of problems goes on and on and on.” She continued, “On the admittedly narrow but incredibly vital issue of public education, we have to work with the future President of the United States.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Moskowitz is a former teacher and New York City Council member who took on the city’s teachers’ union over seniority rights. She launched Success Academy in 2006, and it has since become one of the nation’s highest-profile, non-unionized public charter-school networks, with forty-one schools. The network has posted enviable—even unprecedented—standardized-test scores, while also emphasizing writing, science, chess, and debate. But Moskowitz and her schools have recently had to weather a series of controversies. Success Academy students wear Catholic-school-like uniforms, and teachers are trained to emphasize high expectations, orderliness, and routine. The network has been accused of encouraging children with behavioral problems to leave its schools. Earlier this year, the Times obtained a video in which a teacher at Success Academy Cobble Hill, in Brooklyn, could be seen harshly chastising a first-grade girl who could not answer a math problem correctly, ripping the child’s worksheet into pieces. Moskowitz responded to the ensuing uproar by saying that, while the teacher’s behavior was inappropriate, it was an isolated incident. She and Trump may have been able to commiserate about their troubles with the Times. Politically, Moskowitz is a brawler. Success Academy is funded through a combination of public and philanthropic dollars. Moskowitz has often sought autonomy from New York City education regulations, while at other times she’s lobbied for the city’s support, as in her quest for space in public school buildings. What ties her positions together is her missionary-like zeal for expanding her network and promoting it as a national model for school reform. She prizes flexibility in how Success Academy spends taxpayer money, and here is where Trump’s education platform—which is about allowing states, schools, and parents to spend federal education dollars as they see fit—might hold some appeal for her. Trump’s major education proposal is a twenty-billion-dollar school-choice plan, which would provide vouchers that low-income parents could use to enroll their child in any public, charter, parochial, or private school. With about eleven million schoolchildren living below the poverty line in the U.S., this would amount to just eighteen hundred dollars per student each year. The idea is that states could then supplement the federal voucher with local money. Trump has said that, under his plan, each poor child could end up with a voucher worth twelve thousand dollars. But that amount is significantly less than the twenty-two-thousand-dollar average annual tuition at a nonsectarian private school, and it’s also less than the current annual per-pupil public-school funding in states like New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. At Success Academy, per-pupil funding is about fourteen thousand dollars per year. Moskowitz, unlike many Democrats, is open to the idea of voucherizing the public education system, which would lead to significant reductions in funding for the traditional school districts that currently serve the neediest kids. In an interview earlier this year with Philanthropy Roundtable, a conservative-leaning network of charitable donors, she said, “I am from an F.D.R. liberal-Democratic family. With proximity to government, I have become more libertarian.” On Sunday, she told me, “I’m not as afraid of change as I’m afraid of not changing. . . . I want kids to be able to escape failing schools that trap them. And it’s an unequal trapping of children. The most affluent find a way to escape. They move to a great suburban district or send their kid to a private school. The people who are trapped in the worst schools that have been terrible often for half a century? Those are the poorest kids. They have no other options right now.” Last Friday, Moskowitz led Ivanka Trump on a tour of a Success Academy school in Harlem. She said that this was the first time Ivanka had expressed interest in the schools, but that, about three years ago, Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, had visited another Success Academy school. Moskowitz has other ties to Team Trump. One of Success Academy’s big donors, the hedge-fund manager John Paulson, was a Trump supporter and served on his economic-policy team during the campaign. Meanwhile, at least one other prominent Democratic education reformer, the former Washington, D.C., schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, met with Trump recently about the Secretary of Education job. Like Moskowitz, Rhee is a critic of teachers’ unions. She is best known for instituting a divisive plan in Washington that asked teachers to trade their tenure protections in exchange for performance pay. On Tuesday, Rhee tweeted, “I am not pursuing a position with the administration but I have appreciated the opportunity to share my thoughts on education with the PEOTUS. Interestingly many colleagues warned me against doing so. They are wrong. Mr. Trump won the election.” On Wednesday came the news that Betsy DeVos had accepted the job. She and her husband have funded efforts to create private-school vouchers and protect charter schools from government oversight and regulation. The beginning of the Trump Administration comes at a time of increased tension between the Democratic base and free-market school reformers like Rhee and Moskowitz. On Election Day, Massachusetts voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative that would have increased the number of charter schools in the state. The N.A.A.C.P. has called for a moratorium on the expansion of the charter sector, saying that charters are less accountable than traditional public schools, practice harsher student discipline, and contribute to the segregation of low-income children of color in separate schools. Teachers’ unions have supported parent activists who have chosen to opt their children out of a new generation of high-stakes standardized tests—the same tests that Democratic school reformers, including President Obama, fought to roll out. If the education-reform movement hopes to win the affection of progressive parents and civil-rights groups, they may need to come up with a coherent approach to President Trump. Get too close, and they risk becoming associated with his offensive statements and supporters. But stay too far away, and they may lose the chance to shape what could be the biggest school-choice reform ever proposed.

Making Profits on the Captive Prison Market,8125,"Earlier this year, I attended a prison trade show in Louisiana, which has the nation’s highest rate of incarceration. Cheery representatives from CrossBar, a Kentucky-based company, demonstrated the bendable electronic cigarettes that are sold in prison commissaries. I chatted with employees of Wallace International, which makes the automated front gates for jails. Sentinel, which makes ankle bracelets to track parolees, distributed slick handouts. A couple hundred more exhibitors were packed into a two-hundred-and-twenty-four-thousand-square-foot space in a New Orleans convention center, a space larger than three professional football fields, including the end zones. It was an education in the scale of the industry of profiting on America's incarceration system. A part of that industry was much discussed earlier this month, when the Department of Justice announced it would phase out its use of private prisons. Private prisons—both state and federal—represent just a small slice of the eighty billion dollars spent yearly on corrections, and they housed only about a hundred and thirty-one thousand inmates in 2014, compared with the 1.4 million inmates locked up in government-run facilities. But, because private prison companies routinely lobby Congress for lengthier prison sentences, the federal government’s announcement was seen as a modest victory for criminal-justice-reform advocates, whose long-term goal is to end mass incarceration. But the country’s historic incarceration boom has given rise to companies that provide services and products to government prisons. Many of these provide necessary equipment and services, of course, but some do so in rather unsavory ways. Take, for instance, the prison phone industry, a market that’s dominated by several large, privately held firms that earn an estimated $1.2 billion per year. Short phone calls from prison can cost up to fifteen dollars, largely because the companies operate as monopolies within prison walls. The private companies also offer state and local authorities a percentage of their revenue, which contributes to the surging cost of the calls and creates other perverse incentives. Some jails, for instance, have removed in-person family-visitation rooms to make way for “video visitation” terminals, provided by private firms, which can charge as much as thirty dollars for forty minutes of screen time. One prison phone company, Securus Technologies, says in its marketing materials that it has paid out $1.3 billion in these so-called commissions over the past ten years. “In some respects, this is worse than the private prison companies,” Peter Wagner, the executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit criminal-justice think tank, said. “I expect the government to waste money. But it’s totally different for the government to collude with a private company to make poor people lose money.” Prison phone companies are hardly the only private venders that capitalize on a captive market. Corizon Health, one of the sponsors of the Louisiana prison trade show, is the country’s largest prison health-care firm. It treats more than three hundred thousand prisoners nationwide, earning about $1.4 billion in annual revenue. It is also the subject of numerous investigations and lawsuits. The company has been named as a defendant in at least six hundred and sixty malpractice lawsuits over the past five years, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   In February, 2015, for instance, the company paid out an $8.3 million settlement to the family of Martin Harrison, an inmate at the Santa Rita Jail, in Alameda County, California, who died, the plaintiffs charged, in part because of medical neglect. The lawsuit revealed that Corizon, in a bid to cut costs, used licensed practical nurses to assess inmates at intake—a job that, under California law, only registered nurses are allowed to complete. A court-ordered investigation of Corizon in Idaho, in 2012, revealed “inhumane” conditions in a prison south of Boise, where terminally ill inmates were left for periods of time without food or water and slept in soiled linens. “How does this for-profit prison healthcare company keep its costs low and profits high?” the A.C.L.U. notes on its Web site. “By failing to provide sick prisoners with needed care.” (Martha Harbin, a spokeswoman for Corizon, said that “malpractice lawsuits are a fact of life,"" especially in the correctional environment, where “the patient population is highly litigious.” In response to the Harrison case, she said that “Corizon Health’s contract in Alameda County stipulated our staffing structure” and added that, in Idaho, many conclusions in the court-ordered report “were unsupported by facts and conflicted with the thorough audit of care performed” two years earlier. She also noted that the facility has since been reaccredited.) The prison economy is expansive. In many prisons and jails, basic commissary items like cereal and canned soup can cost five times the retail price. As the country’s inmate population has ballooned, so has revenue. The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit criminal-justice think tank, estimates that commissary companies earn $1.6 billion per year. The list of for-profit prison venders goes on: there are companies that use technology to scour prisons to find cell phones, companies that sell prisoner-transport vans, and companies that sell radar systems to prevent drones from dropping contraband into prison yards. Even the American for-profit bail market has grown to an estimated annual three billion dollars, according to the market-research firm IBISWorld. These companies’ activities tend to get less scrutiny than those of private prisons. Wagner has a few theories for why this might be. For one thing, physical prisons are run by contractors, “which makes them easy to demonize.” And, secondly, he said, “they’re publicly traded.” This is an important point. In reporting and researching the industry around incarceration, you quickly discover that finding accurate financial information about many of these companies is nearly impossible. Why? They’re almost all privately held—except for the private prison companies. And, because the two largest private prison operators, Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO Group, are publicly held and must therefore make more information public, reporters (myself included) find them easier to write about. “Private prison companies have to disclose offensive-sounding things in their prospectuses, like ‘If crime goes down, it will be bad for our bottom line,’ ” Wagner said. “The privately held companies are never forced to say something so impolite. So the attention that the private-prisons industry gets is a side effect of our corporate transparency laws for publicly traded companies.” Private prisons deserve to be investigated: they have been found to provide substandard living conditions, improper medical care, and poor training for guards. In announcing the decision to phase out private prisons in the federal system, Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates noted that private prisons “compare poorly” with government-run institutions—they don’t save much money and provide worse security. But it also raises the question: Would eliminating private prisons end mass incarceration? It’s unlikely. And it certainly won’t prevent private companies from profiting on prisoners.

What Aetna’s Withdrawal Means for Obamacare,6214,"Few companies are as unpopular as insurance companies, and no tears were shed for the insurance giant Aetna when, a couple of weeks ago, it announced that it had lost more than four hundred million dollars on Obamacare policies since the Obamacare exchanges were set up, in 2014, and was going to pull out of most of them. The news, which followed similar announcements by United Healthcare and Humana, was greeted with talk of “whining” insurers who “put profits before patients’ health” and are “willing to deny care to make a few extra dollars.” But the recriminations are misplaced. Aetna’s decision reflects an awkward reality: the jerry-rigged, politically compromised nature of Obamacare has made the program unstable, and unable to live up to its lofty promises. It’s not that Obamacare has failed. As Larry Levitt, a health-care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me, “The main goal of the law was to reduce the number of uninsured people, and twenty million more people are covered today because of it. It’s hard to call that a failure.” The reforms that Obamacare put in place have guaranteed access to insurance for people with preëxisting conditions, and have done away with caps on how much insurance companies will spend. Access to health care is less precarious than it used to be. Still, we’re a long way from the future that Barack Obama envisaged when, in 2009, addressing the American Medical Association, he called for “comprehensive reform that covers everyone” and provides “affordable health insurance to every single American.” Some thirty million Americans remain uninsured. Participants in the A.C.A. marketplaces are less numerous, and sicker, than anticipated: 8.3 million fewer people enrolled through the exchanges this year than the Congressional Budget Office had projected. As a result, insurers in much of the country are fleeing the marketplaces. Kaiser estimates that between twenty and twenty-five per cent of U.S. counties may have only one insurer offering coverage in 2017; there’s already a county in Arizona with no Obamacare insurer at all. And the insurers that remain in these markets tend to offer an increasingly narrow network of health-care providers. Lack of competition is a recipe for high premiums or low benefits (or both), further deterring younger, healthier people from buying policies. Which means that the risk pool gets still older and sicker, which means that more insurance companies lose money and leave the market, which means that competition is reduced even further, which means: see above. The U.S. could well end up with a two-tier insurance market, in which people lucky enough to get insurance through their employers will get much better coverage and wider options than those on the individual market, even when both groups are paying the same amount in premiums. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures Obamacare is being hobbled by the political compromises made to get it passed. The program’s basic principles were the right ones: everyone would be able to get insurance, regardless of preëxisting conditions, and everyone would pay the same price for a given policy, with upward adjustments made only for older people and smokers. In short, insurance companies were prohibited from managing risk by charging healthy, low-risk people less than frailer, high-risk people. Since managing risk is typically key to how insurers make money, it would have made sense to leave them out and just enroll everyone in a government-run program like Medicare. Politics, of course, ruled that out. Shoring up the private-side approach would require penalties stiff enough to get young, healthy Americans to buy health insurance, but politics ruled that out as well. Conservatives point to Obamacare’s marketplace woes as evidence that government should stop mucking around with health insurance. In fact, government hasn’t mucked around enough: if we want to make universal health insurance a reality, the government needs to do more, not less. That doesn’t require scrapping the current system: the Netherlands and Switzerland both demonstrate that you can get universal coverage through private insurers. But their examples also show that to do so we’d need to make it much harder to avoid buying insurance, and we’d need to expand subsidies to consumers. Alternatively, we could implement the public option, which Obama himself called for in that 2009 speech: a federal program, modelled on Medicare, open to anyone on the individual market. The public option would guarantee that there was always at least one good choice available in the marketplace, and would provide competition for private insurers. If it used the government’s bargaining power to hold down costs and expand access, it could offer good benefits at a low enough price to attract younger, healthier patients. There are solid arguments for both of these models. Either would work, if there were a shift in the political mood and it were given a shot. Even if nothing is done, Obamacare will continue to limp along, probably turning into something akin to Medicaid. But the departure of big insurers like Aetna has made it clear that, if we don’t do more to help cover people in the individual market, the program will never make good on its original promise of truly comprehensive reform. So don’t hate the players; fix the game. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Steven Brill on how health-care reform went wrong.

Everyone Knows About the G.O.P. Crackup&#8212;Everyone Except the Voters,8933,"The Republican Party is shattered. Fissured. Over. Dead. These suggestions, and more, have been inspired by the rise of Donald Trump, who has defied and embarrassed Party leaders (and pundits!) to become the presumptive 2016 Republican nominee for President. The conventional wisdom was that he would be stopped, but it turned out that no putative stopper was equal to the task, and now the Party is stuck with a candidate whom many Republicans can’t stand, one whose elevation may portend the crackup of Republicanism itself. Or so we are told. But do Republicans really dislike their nominee? Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, has hinted that he does. Last year, after Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,” Ryan strongly rebuked him, saying the proposal was “not what this party stands for.” Last week, as the last of Trump’s Republican rivals suspended their campaigns, Ryan said that he was “not ready” to support Trump. In response, Trump released a rather puckish statement of his own, saying that he was “not ready to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda.” This back and forth culminated in a meeting between Trump and Ryan on Thursday—a meeting so eagerly anticipated, at least by political obsessives, that MSNBC created a countdown clock for it, even though the event being counted down to was, of course, untelevised. The meeting ended, predictably if anticlimactically, with a joint statement in which Trump and Ryan promised to keep talking—while working, in the meantime, to defeat Hillary Clinton. “While we were honest about our few differences,” the statement read, “we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground.” The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer called this halfhearted reconciliation a “sham marriage,” suggesting that the underlying ideological divide was too wide to be bridged. But Ryan, like most successful politicians, is a flexible character. (In the aughts, he set aside his concerns about deficits to support George W. Bush’s policies; more recently, he has criticized those policies without quite disavowing them, saying that the Bush era made him “miserable.”) And one needn’t be a thoroughgoing cynic to suspect that both the Trump-Ryan feud and its provisional resolution are examples of political kayfabe. Trump, after all, gains from the perception that he is tough and independent-minded, willing to stand up to Washington politicians. And Ryan, too, gains from the perception that his ongoing conversion from critic to ally is serious and gruelling: the result of a months-long negotiation and mutual evolution, and not, say, the result of a quick political calculation. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? But what of all the voters who agree with Ryan? Anyone who has spent months reading stories about Trump as a polarizing force might have been surprised by a recent poll, from Public Policy Polling, which suggested that Ryan himself was a rather polarizing figure: only forty per cent of Republicans approved of Ryan’s Speakership, while forty-four per cent disapproved of it. By contrast, a recent YouGov poll found that sixty-eight per cent of Republicans have a favorable impression of Trump, while only thirty-two per cent have an unfavorable impression of him. This is a marked shift from last summer, when Trump’s favorability ratings among Republicans were negative; as the disputes of primary season fade, Republican opposition to him will likely shrink further. It is true that, compared to Clinton, Trump remains a relatively controversial choice—the same poll found that Clinton’s favorable–unfavorable rating among Democrats was 83–16. But general-election polls have found that voters, when asked to choose between Trump and Clinton, respond in ways that resemble the results of recent Presidential elections. A Quinnipiac poll this past week suggested that the usual battleground states might be battlegrounds once again in November: in a Clinton-Trump race, Trump was ahead by four percentage points in Ohio, while Clinton had a statistically insignificant one-point lead in Florida and Pennsylvania. (The margin of error was three per cent.) Most national polls show Clinton ahead of Trump—as of Friday, the RealClearPolitics poll average gave her a 5.7-per-cent lead, which would be a comfortable victory, but not a blowout. (Barack Obama defeated John McCain by about seven percentage points in the 2008 popular vote; in 2012, he defeated Romney by about four percentage points.) There may be evidence of an anti-Trump rebellion in Utah, a reliably red state full of conservative voters who evidently dislike him; in March, a poll showed him losing to Clinton by two per cent there, which was within the margin of error. But in most of the country, Trump seems to attract roughly as much support as recent Republican Presidential candidates. If there is a Republican split, it’s not showing up in the polls. The backlash to Trump among Republicans and conservatives was always most pronounced in leaders and opinion leaders, which is probably what made the backlash seem more severe than it really was. It is not hard to find political writers who support Republicans but refuse to support Trump, although the #nevertrump movement seems to be fading. And there are still a few prominent Republican politicians who remain immune to Trump’s brusque charm, although Ryan isn’t the only elected official who seems to be planning his eventual conversion. A recent Politico article bore a headline that suggested electoral catastrophe: “republicans consider clinton over trump.” But the article itself noted, accurately, that “the most absolutist opposition to Trump is held largely by the GOP’s donor class and Washington-based establishment—the very people Trump and his supporters have delighted in offending from the start.” Of course, these élite Republicans are outnumbered by voters, who don’t seem particularly troubled by Trump’s endless and uncategorizable deviations, provocations, and fluctuations, perhaps because Trump himself is so hard to pin down. On Friday morning, calling in to “Fox & Friends,” on Fox News, Trump explained that his plan to block foreign Muslims from entering the country was more like a “suggestion.” He said, “Everything’s a suggestion,” which is a pretty good summary of his approach to policy: he makes big, forceful statements while simultaneously suggesting, more quietly, that the actual details will be determined later, and might not match his pronouncements. Even on immigration, his signature issue, Trump is surprisingly squishy. He has talked about establishing a “deportation force” to expel unauthorized immigrants, but it seems that what he really favors is a version of an immigration policy known as touchback, in which unauthorized immigrants must leave the country in order to apply for legal resident status. (Lindsey Graham was one of a group of Republican senators who sponsored a touchback amendment to the doomed 2007 immigration-reform bill.) Last year, Trump told CNN, “I would get people out, and I would have an expedited way of getting them back into the country, so they would be legal.” It remains possible (though by no means certain) that Trump will prove to be a weak general-election candidate, unable to improve upon Romney’s performance, or maybe even McCain’s. Perhaps, in a general election, voters will recoil from his insults, from his seemingly extemporaneous policy pronouncements, from his all-around Trumpiness. Or perhaps some independent voters will decide, as most Republicans already have, that a Trump Presidency, however unpredictable, is more palatable than the likely alternative. His candidacy has already changed the way Republicans talk about immigration, and it may also have an effect on the rest of the Party platform. But from the scant evidence we have so far, it seems that the vast majority of Republican voters will probably vote for Trump this November, which explains why, despite all the protestation, Ryan and most of the other Republican leaders will probably find a way to do what political leaders usually do: follow.

Chicago’s Political Priest,50558,"On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the shooting that wounded former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, CNN hosted a town hall with President Barack Obama on the topic of guns in America. The live audience, at George Mason University, in Virginia, included people whom CNN had flown in: gun owners, gun sellers, survivors of shootings, and relatives of victims. The first three questions came from skeptics of greater gun control—the widow of a Navy seal, a rape survivor from Colorado, and a Republican sheriff running for Congress in Arizona. Then the Reverend Doctor Michael L. Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest dressed in a black jacket and a white collar, took the microphone. “I happen to be from one of those cities where violence is not going down,” he said. “There’s been eleven killed in seven days in Chicago.” For forty years, Pfleger has worked and lived at the Faith Community of St. Sabina, Chicago’s largest African-American Catholic church. His neighborhood, Auburn-Gresham, is ninety-eight per cent black. Pfleger is white. At sixty-six, he has heavy eyes and side-swept brown hair that has not changed much in color or style since the Johnson Administration. “It’s easier to get a gun in my neighborhood than it is a computer,” he told the President, adding, “For many years, nobody even cared about Chicago, because the violence is primarily black and brown.” In Chicago, Pfleger is a showman of the first order. He usually preaches with an eight-piece band, a choir, and a troupe of dancers, all arrayed beneath a painting, twenty feet tall, of a young black Jesus wearing a white robe. His parishioners once nicknamed him Cecil B. De Pfleger. At a funeral that I attended for Vince Clark, his assistant and friend, Pfleger concluded the eulogy by putting on one of Clark’s signature fedoras and downing a shot of rum, the deceased’s favorite drink. He drew a standing ovation. Obama greeted Pfleger warmly. “Father Mike, first of all, for those of you who don’t know him, has been working since before I moved to Chicago, and I was a twenty-three-year-old when I first met him. And somehow I aged, and he didn’t.” The President added, “Father Pfleger has done heroic work at St. Sabina Parish.” Television viewers saw a gesture of kinship between a President and a priest, but their relationship has been fraught. Both are indebted to Saul Alinsky, the father of the Chicago school of community organizing, and when Obama was a state senator Pfleger was an important supporter. But in May, 2008, while Obama was campaigning against Hillary Clinton—and after the controversial racial statements of Obama’s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, had created an uproar—Pfleger disparaged Clinton in a raucous sermon, drawing a mock tear down his cheek and shouting, “I’m white! I’m entitled! There’s a black man stealing my show!” The clip went viral, and Obama condemned Pfleger’s “divisive, backward-looking rhetoric” and removed Pfleger’s endorsement from his site. Pfleger and Wright, who are close friends, commiserated about a shared predicament. “We were pawns in that game of trying to make sure he didn’t get elected,” Wright told me. Pfleger’s church was swamped with calls and e-mails; some called him a “white nigger.” Recently, I asked Pfleger if he and the President have reconciled. “Yes and no,” he said. “I’ve never been to the White House while he’s been there.” They have occasional encounters, such as the town-hall event. “We see each other. We’re fine,” he said, but he suspects that, as long as Obama is in office, political aides would prefer that he kept his distance, and he does not press the point. On CNN, Pfleger noted that most of the guns used in Chicago’s violence are bought legally but eventually get into the hands of criminals; he asked why the United States “can’t title guns just like cars,” in order to track their custody. Obama, who has tried unsuccessfully to persuade Congress to pass new gun laws, including a background check for private gun purchases, replied, “Issues like licensing, registration—that’s an area where there’s just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it.” He added, “We did a military exercise in Texas, and a whole bunch of folks were sure that this was the start of martial law.” When I was a reporter on the city desk at the Chicago Tribune, in the nineteen-nineties, I often saw Pfleger leading demonstrations, and he struck me as a throwback to the sixties and seventies, a street priest of the era when the Chicago cleric Monsignor Jack Egan was marching in Selma and the Berrigan brothers—radical pacifist priests—were bringing street theatre to activism and invading draft-board offices. Later, though the Church’s reach and authority had remained unrivalled in Chicago, its left wing withdrew, as it did in much of America, from overt confrontations over social justice. Not Pfleger. He has a long rap sheet, including dozens of arrests for trespassing and disorderly conduct, resulting from protests against apartheid in South Africa, against the sale of drug paraphernalia, and, most recently, against guns. In 1991, he faced five years on felony charges. A study had found that Chicago’s minority communities contained five times the number of alcohol advertisements as white neighborhoods, and three times the number of tobacco ads. In a series of midnight raids, Pfleger and members of his church splattered red paint on billboards. He went to trial and was acquitted. In the past two years, the anger that ignited around issues of race, guns, and power—the moral drama that swept out of Ferguson, Missouri, to Cleveland, New York, Cincinnati, and beyond—has expanded into something approaching a national renegotiation over fairness and wealth, over the legacies of racism and the true meaning of security. In this new American moment, Father Pfleger has turned out to be less a relic than a man ahead of his time. David Axelrod, the President’s former chief strategist, told me, “When Obama was running for the Senate, we polled a bunch of leaders in the black community to see who would be the most credible testimonials for radio ads. I was stunned to see that Mike Pfleger was the most popular figure in the African-American community.” Haki Madhubuti, a poet and book publisher on the South Side, said, “I’ve been involved with the black struggle for over fifty years. Mike Pfleger loves black people. He is a man of moral authority, and he is my brother—in many cases, even more than some of the so-called Negroes out here who call me their brother.” He went on, “This is important, because the Catholic Church has basically lost its moral authority, really. But he has been able to take St. Sabina and bring credibility back to that church.” In recent months, Chicago has been consumed by a crisis around race and justice that imperils the political future of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was Obama’s chief of staff during his first years in the White House. A dash-cam video released in November showed a white Chicago police officer killing a black teen-ager named Laquan McDonald. Police, responding to suspected car break-ins, had approached McDonald, and he was walking away, with a knife in his hand, when the officer, Jason Van Dyke, fired sixteen shots. The video contradicts police reports, suggesting an orchestrated coverup. The Justice Department is investigating the incident and the conduct of the Chicago police. The furor over the case exposed deep problems in the police department’s response to citizen complaints, its rare punishment of problematic officers, and City Hall’s tacit coöperation. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   Since 2004, Chicago had quietly approved more than five hundred million dollars in settlements for police misconduct. Emanuel’s administration fought, in court, to keep the video of McDonald’s death from being made public, arguing that the release of evidence could taint an investigation before it was complete. In April, Emanuel was reëlected; that fall, a Cook County judge ordered the release of the video. Critics charged that Emanuel had tried to bury it. By February, his approval rating had dropped to twenty-seven per cent, its lowest level since he took office, in 2011. Protesters calling for his resignation have picketed in front of his house, shouting, “Sixteen shots and a coverup!” When I asked Toni Preckwinkle, who, as the Cook County board president, is one of the highest-ranking black politicians in town, whether Emanuel still has the confidence of the public, she paused. “I don’t know,” she said. “Whatever legacy he hopes to have as mayor will be impacted by how he addresses this issue.” Pfleger, who endorsed the Mayor for reëlection and trades text messages with him, is torn between wanting to be close to Emanuel, in order to exploit his vulnerability, and needing to be seen as a critic. He said that he confronted Emanuel about the case. “He told me to my face, ‘Mike, I did nothing illegal. I swear to God. Nothing, Mike.’ ‘It’s O.K., I believe that,’ I said.” Emanuel has maintained that he was following City Hall procedure by keeping the video a secret, but Pfleger considers that to be a failing. “I said, ‘You knew the process was fucked up, so you hid behind the process.’ ” Rather than call for Emanuel’s resignation, Pfleger is asking for something that he regards as more precious: jobs and development projects in African-American areas of Chicago. He said, “I call it, from the spiritual standpoint, a kairos moment”—a propitious set of circumstances. “We have an enormous opportunity to make some real changes in Chicago. My two concerns are: one, that we don’t blow it, because I don’t know when it might come again; and, two, that we don’t make too small an ask and just deal with the issue at hand, the police department. The city needs an overhaul, not just the police.” He went on, “You drive through it, you see boarded-up homes, broken glass, closed-up businesses. And they’ll tell people, ‘Be hopeful!’ But you have to transform what you see. What do we do to make the South Side look like the North Side—and not just make it, demand it?” In a city of canny political players, Pfleger excels. “Every Sunday, we do a voter registration here,” he said. “I’ve called for everybody who can to take off work on March 15th” —the Illinois primary—“and make sure everybody in your house or everybody on your block goes to the polls.” Archdiocese rules usually require priests to rotate after one or two six-year terms, but Pfleger has thwarted repeated efforts to move him. (In 2011, the archdiocese effectively gave up. In 2019, Pfleger will be seventy, the age at which parish priests are expected to retire.) At St. Sabina’s, Pfleger has outlasted three cardinals and five mayors. Some people in Chicago dismiss Pfleger as a huckster who is more interested in getting attention than in working to find solutions. A police-officer blog calls him Pfather Pfaker. Others accuse him of being too cozy with City Hall, a moderate posing as a radical. Maze Jackson, a political commentator on WVON, Chicago’s black-oriented talk-radio station, told me that Pfleger is prone to “negotiated protest.” Jackson admires Pfleger’s dedication but is uneasy with a bargain that says, in Jackson’s words, “I’m not going to take a whack at the Mayor, because we’ve got some things working.” Last year, when Spike Lee was preparing to make “Chi-Raq,” about violence in Chicago, he asked Pfleger to introduce him to gang members, parents of slain children, and others. “Father Pfleger is the great facilitator,” Lee told me. “He’s the point guard, with everything coming through him.” Lee copied sentences from Pfleger’s sermons in creating the character of a white priest played by John Cusack. “That character,” Lee said, “is a cross between Father Pfleger and the father that Karl Malden played in ‘On the Waterfront.’ ” When the film came out, Vic Mensa, a Chicago hip-hop artist, criticized the “white savior concept” as “hurtful to our power as dark-skinned people.” Lee responded that that might be true if Cusack’s character didn’t exist, and added, “He would not be there forty years if he’s not the real deal. He’s a living saint, and they’re lucky they got him.” Jeremiah Wright told me that he recently slipped into the back of Pfleger’s church, unannounced, to hear his sermon. “I sat up in the balcony, trying to be obscure,” he told me. At one point, Pfleger referred to himself as white, and it gave Wright pause. “I accept him so much that you forget, Oh, yeah, he really is a white guy.” If you set off from the site where Laquan McDonald died—between a Burger King and a Dunkin’ Donuts, at the intersection of Forty-first Street and South Pulaski Road—and head south for five miles, you’ll reach an earlier landmark in the history of race and politics in Chicago. On a sultry afternoon in August, 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr., stepped out of a car in the Marquette Park neighborhood and prepared to march against housing discrimination. The Great Migration had raised the city’s black population from two per cent to nearly thirty-three per cent, but Chicago stood out for its innovations in what Ta-Nehisi Coates has described as “segregationist social engineering”: the erection of isolated, homogeneous public housing; the racial panic fanned by real-estate agents who flipped houses for a profit; the covenants that barred white homeowners from selling to blacks; the practice of “redlining,” by means of which banks refused home loans to blacks. By 1940, Chicago was more racially segregated than Richmond, Virginia. Marquette Park was home to the white ethnic working class, Poles and Lithuanians, who had invested their life savings in their homes. They feared losing their investments and their neighborhood, as they saw it, to integration. And so when King and his followers arrived in Marquette Park the residents hurled stones and bottles. King was hit in the head with a rock, and said afterward, “I have seen many demonstrations in the South, but I have never seen anything so hostile and so hateful as I’ve seen here today.” By the end of August, King and the mayor, Richard J. Daley, had struck a “Summit Agreement,” which pledged an end to housing discrimination, but it was unenforceable, and Daley later shrugged it off as a “gentleman’s agreement.” Pfleger grew up two miles south of Marquette Park, in the working-class neighborhood of Ashburn, which was then all white. His father, Louis, had a job in a ward office for the Daley machine, and his mother was a secretary at the local parish. Their first child, Joan, had a cognitive disability. “She had such a big heart, and I grew up watching my sister being called ‘retarded’ by kids, and laughed at,” Pfleger told me. “I watched how she was treated, and there was a rage in me, which I tried to bury.” Pfleger’s parents were unusually progressive. “Two words were never allowed in our house: the F-word or the N-word.” I asked how they came to be so out of step with their neighbors, and he said that his mother always resented efforts to shape her opinion. “My mother was wild,” he told me, laughing. “My mother would also beat the shit out of me.” He went on, “My parents taught me unconditional love and freedom of speech. And I don’t know how they were the way they were, but they were.” In high school, Pfleger knew little of black Chicago. In 1966, he ventured to Marquette Park, to see King lead his fateful march. In the crowd, Pfleger spotted neighbors and members of his parish. “It was an enormous amount of hate that I’d never seen before,” he recalled. “And seeing King, who refused to respond to that hate, I rode my bike home that day saying, ‘Wow, this guy is either crazy or he has some power I don’t know about.’ ” Because of his mother’s role at the church, Pfleger had considered the priesthood, and his encounter with King’s union of activism and religion drove him to join a seminary. “Everything I could cut out from the papers about King I would, and paste up on my wall,” he said. “I became, and probably still am, obsessed with him.” Even before he was ordained, Pfleger bridled against the strictures imposed by the Catholic Church. As a seminarian, he picketed Cardinal John Patrick Cody for cutting funds at inner-city schools, and when Pfleger decided that he needed extra tickets for his ordination service he printed thirty counterfeits. But, politically, he fit well into the Catholic Church of the early seventies, when it was active on social-justice issues, combatting poverty, segregation, and racism. (Later, Cardinal Francis George criticized Pfleger for his provocations, including a protest against gun sellers, in which Pfleger said of one vender, “Like a rat we’re gonna pull you out.” Pfleger told the Cardinal, “Hold up. I’m the same person I always was. The Church turned.”) Still in his twenties, Pfleger took up residence at Precious Blood Parish, near Western Avenue and the Eisenhower Expressway, a poor stretch of the West Side, where he met Black Panthers and studied local storefront preachers. As he recounted to Robert McClory, a former priest who wrote a biography of Pfleger titled “Radical Disciple,” he admired the Baptists and the Pentecostalists, who put “their whole selves into the service.” Pfleger preaches in a pronounced Southern accent, rich in the black vernacular, bellowing and whispering like an old-time tent revivalist. At one point, he was assigned to Glenview, a white middle-class suburb, and he recruited kids to volunteer for social-service projects in the city. “He was the Pied Piper we all followed,” Sue Leonis, a business consultant who met Pfleger when she was sixteen, told me. “We worked the soup line and at Cook County Jail, protested treatment of migrant workers, and tutored minority kids in their neighborhoods.” And he brought black kids to Glenview to play front-yard basketball. “You have no idea how neighbors reacted. ‘Where did these kids come from, and what’s happening to our neighborhood?’ ” Leonis recalled. “He brought kids together who in no way would ever have had that chance in those times.” In 1975, Pfleger was assigned to St. Sabina, which was in rapid decline. Whites had left, and few of the new black residents were Catholic. The church was built to hold more than a thousand people; on a good Sunday, it got sixty. He embraced black-liberation theology, developed, by James H. Cone, after the 1967 riots in Newark and Detroit. Cone was seeking to reconcile the black nationalism of Malcolm X with the Christian civil disobedience of Martin Luther King, Jr., and he emphasized the obligation of the Church to relieve the oppression of African-Americans, especially through political action. Pfleger painted the parish bus in red, black, and green, introduced gospel music (a rarity in a Catholic church), and commissioned Afrocentric decorations for the altar. Jeremiah Wright, who befriended Pfleger in the eighties, told me that he aroused resistance from some conservative black clergy: “They wrote him off, never got to know him, never did, in fact, have a talk with him, or go to assess his experience, his heart, and his passion. ‘Oh, that’s just a white boy, you know. These white liberals come into our community like a flash of gold in the pan.’ The more he expanded beyond the church walls, the madder they got.” Pfleger had his first taste of publicity in the late nineteen-eighties, when he joined an older black priest named George Clements to pressure local stores into ending the sale of drug paraphernalia. From his congregation, Pfleger named a journalist his “minister of communications,” and they learned to alert the media whenever they planned a confrontation. (Spurred by the campaign, the Illinois legislature outlawed the sale of drug paraphernalia.) Then he upped the stakes, exposing local drug dealers by name, which brought threats against his life. For a time, he was assigned a two-man police detail by the city. In 1982, the archdiocese learned that Pfleger had applied to adopt a child. It ordered him to stop. His idea was not unprecedented; a year earlier, Clements had adopted a son against the wishes of Chicago Church leaders, who withdrew their opposition after Pope John Paul II signalled his assent. In Pfleger’s case, too, the archdiocese eventually relented. He adopted a second son, Beronti, a decade later, and in 1997 he was named the foster parent of Jarvis Franklin, a sixteen-year-old who had become a ward of the Department of Children and Family Services. (In 2012, Beronti died from a blood clot following knee-replacement surgery.) Pfleger’s father, a widower, embraced the boys, but the adoptions alienated others in the family. According to McClory, a cousin told Pfleger, “I’m glad you did this, but why did you have to adopt a nigger?” Lamar, who went on to college and the Army, and now lives in the Chicago suburbs with his wife and their six children, told me, “He lost the majority of his family because he supported the black community. Cousins, nephews, uncles, and nieces. They abandoned him.” He went on, “It was devastating at first, but the black community uplifted him. It encompassed him. It filled a void that his family left behind.” Fifty years after King’s visit to Marquette Park, Chicago remains one of the country’s most racially segregated large cities. Redlining is long over, but its legacy is inscribed on the neighborhoods. Some of those areas are poorer than they were at the time of King’s marches. In Englewood, on the South Side, poverty has grown from twenty-seven per cent, in 1970, to forty-eight per cent today. In the past decade and a half, the city knocked down Cabrini-Green, the Robert Taylor Homes, and other poverty-stricken public high-rises, but studies have found that the effort has done little to advance integration by race or income. A 2014 study by the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law documented frequent discrimination against those people who try to rent using subsidized vouchers from the Chicago Housing Authority. On the city’s Northwest Side, landlords refused to rent to them fifty-eight per cent of the time. Most of the residents resettled in heavily black, low-income census tracts. Those areas are distinguished by the sheer absence of economic life: few hardware stores, pharmacies, and restaurants, and virtually no banks. For more than twenty years, Robert Sampson, a Harvard sociologist, and a team of researchers have conducted a study of human development in Chicago neighborhoods. “The incarceration rate in the highest-ranked black community in Chicago is forty times higher than the incarceration rate in the highest-ranked white community,” he said. “You can’t even compare them.” Sampson’s team visited many cities—including New York, Baltimore, and New Orleans—before choosing Chicago. “If you want to trace across multiple dimensions the legacies of inequality, Chicago is a microcosm of all the things that are bearing down on cities,” Sampson said. His Chicago portrait, “Great American City,” challenges the argument that globalization and technology have flattened boundaries and details how the distance of a few blocks still determines the basic probabilities in life—the chances of hearing a tip on a job prospect, or receiving a first-time loan, or being hit by crossfire. Last year, four hundred and sixty-eight people were killed in Chicago, a higher total than in any other American city, and up thirteen per cent from the previous year. Most were killed in black neighborhoods, where homicide rates are thirteen times higher, on average, than in better-off white areas. “If you don’t expect to live past twenty-two, then why would you delay gratification for something in the future that may never come?” Sampson said. “That, in turn, influences every big decision.” As early as preschool, the threat or the experience of violence can induce stress that distorts academic performance. The extent to which growing up in a poor black neighborhood in Chicago hampered verbal development was found to be the equivalent of “missing one year of schooling.” Nearly forty-seven per cent of all black men in Chicago between the ages of twenty and twenty-four are neither in school nor working—the highest percentage of any big city. (Nationwide, the figure is thirty-two per cent.) Natalie Moore, a reporter for the radio station WBEZ and the author of “The South Side,” a forthcoming book on race and inequity, grew up in Chatham, a historic black neighborhood, and works out of a storefront bureau on Seventy-fifth Street. When I dropped by, she was finishing a piece inspired by the Laquan McDonald case. His life was short and cruel: His mother, who was fourteen when she became pregnant, had a boyfriend who abused him. By the time he was five, McDonald was punching himself in the face at day care. Moore said, “He was a runaway from the Department of Children and Family Services,” who had been arrested repeatedly for drugs. On the night of his final encounter with the police, on Pulaski Road, he had PCP in his system. Moore has come to see the current crisis in Chicago as tied to a void in black leadership. In 1983, Harold Washington, who came from the South Side, became Chicago’s first black mayor. This was a revolutionary development in urban America, marrying the civil-rights agenda with electoral politics, and it inspired Obama to move to Chicago (hoping, someday, to succeed Washington). But Washington died at his desk, in 1987, and soon Daley’s son Richard M. Daley moved into City Hall, where he stayed for twenty-two years. “Black politics died when Harold Washington died,” Moore said. “Chicago is kind of like Rome, the city-state,” she went on. “The transition from King Richard to Emperor Emanuel has not been an easy one, and I think people have felt more empowered to do something now,” to demand more from City Hall. The activists, not the politicians, are ascendant, she said. “I don’t think anyone really feels like elected leadership has moved the Mayor on the Laquan McDonald case. The activism is all from outside.” The great stone bell tower of St. Sabina can be seen for a dozen blocks in any direction. As Pfleger walked through the sanctuary one morning, on his way to a meeting, he gestured toward the splendor above, and winced. “The stained glass was brought from Paris in 1933—the middle of the Depression,” he said. “People were standing in bread lines, and they’re bringing in marble.” Most days, Pfleger can be found in the rectory, in a cramped office with faux-wood walls that are the color of peanut butter. Across from his desk, a grainy computer screen displays twelve security cameras from around the church complex. Every once in a while, he shouts “Justice!,” which is the name of his cocker spaniel, who’s in frequent need of guidance. The walls of Pfleger’s office are covered with photographs of friends and visitors: Coretta Scott King, Desmond Tutu, Johnnie Cochran, Mr. T. There are mementos: a signed photograph of Muhammad Ali knocking out Sonny Liston (the same image that Barack Obama once used to decorate his Senate office); a bill of sale from a slave auction in 1849; a shard of a seat from the bus boarded by Rosa Parks in Montgomery in 1955. Pfleger has expanded St. Sabina beyond the church and the school, to include a food pantry, a job-training center, and apartments for low-income residents and the elderly. Parishioners are asked to tithe ten per cent of their income, but, given their income level, that is a mighty ask. Pfleger and nonprofits associated with the church are constantly angling for grants and loans from the city, state, and federal governments—to fund after-school programs, for instance, hire former gang members to disrupt feuds, or administer flu shots. Pfleger also relies on private donations for other activities, including paying witnesses to name assailants whom others are afraid to identify. As Emanuel’s troubles deepened, Pfleger, seeing an opportunity, pressured City Hall to steer development to parts of the South and West Sides where unemployment is high. The nearest commercial strip, Seventy-ninth Street, alternates between vibrancy and ruin. “We’ve lost three black businesses on Seventy-ninth Street over the past year and a half,” Pfleger said. “I don’t want to find just jobs. I want black businessmen to be able to come in and open up and own stuff in this neighborhood.” He was working with Leonard Muhammad, a senior official in the Nation of Islam. One recent morning, he was on the phone with Muhammad, talking through a prospective meeting with City Hall. Pfleger laughed and said, in unpriestly terms, “I’m committed to being an asshole as long as I’m breathing.” He went on, “People say, ‘Kick ’em when they’re down.’ I say, ‘When they’re down, go through their pockets!’ ” He promised to arrange the meeting, and they wrapped up. He said, “All right, brother. Bless you, man. Salaam alaikum.” He spent the next hour on the phone. He spoke to John W. Rogers, Jr., a friend of the Obamas who runs Ariel Investments, about an upcoming dinner plan. He helped a local television reporter who was seeking three victims of gun violence for a story. He called to comfort a mother whose son had been killed. After a few days at St. Sabina’s, I had an appointment to meet with Rahm Emanuel, at noon on a Saturday. It’s been twenty-five years since Emanuel first came to national attention, in his early thirties, as an ambitious, acerbic aide on Bill Clinton’s campaign. From the first, he was known as a ruthless tactician, impatient with idealists and the weak of will. He was the fiercest of the Clinton circle’s warriors: profane, abrupt, and, at his best, effective. As a member of the House, and then as President Obama’s chief of staff, his approach was much the same. At fifty-six, he is still coiled like a spring. More than most politicians, he embraces his stereotype—the pugilism, the thin skin, the vocabulary. During our interview, I asked if he was conducting any internal polling about the crisis. He said no, adding, “Now you know that all the assumptions you have about me are fucking wrong.” This is echt Emanuel, quick to put his interlocutor on guard and off balance. I brought up the video of the killing of Laquan McDonald. More than a month after the release of the tape, everyone was still wondering if Emanuel was telling the truth when he said that he knew nothing about the case before his reëlection. Many in Chicago found it hard to imagine that the mayor of a city with historic police problems, at a moment when law-enforcement conduct was a national political issue—a mayor who cultivated an image of attention to small details—would not have wanted more information. He said, “I was reassured that four entities were crawling all over this thing: one, the state’s attorney; one, the U.S. attorney in the name of the Justice Department; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and IPRA”—the Independent Police Review Authority, the civilian board that investigates the most serious cases. He dismisses claims that he helped prevent the release of the video; he defines his mistake narrowly: “I don’t think I ever thought that it still would take until December, a year later,” for local prosecutors to finish their investigation. In December, in an effort to regain the city’s trust, Emanuel addressed the City Council, choking up as he said, “If we’re going to begin the healing process, the first step in that journey is my step, and I’m sorry.” He promised to remake the Chicago Police Department. But a week after his speech, when Emanuel visited Urban Prep, a prominent, predominantly black charter school for boys, students chanted, “Sixteen shots!” A few days before we met, some black pastors had boycotted a breakfast hosted by the Mayor to commemorate Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s birthday. Protesters had interrupted the event, shouting, “Shame on you!” He described the protests to me as part of a national trend. “I found out from my colleagues: The mayor of Minneapolis was booed off the stage; she didn’t finish her speech. The mayor of Denver couldn’t get his M.L.K. event off the ground.” He didn’t think the protests reflected broad sentiment in Chicago. “I respect people’s passion and the desire to do this,” he said. “I know the difference between people who are protesting on the issue and people who are relitigating the 2011 and 2015 election. And I’m not the only person getting protests across the country.” Emanuel must reform a police department without so demoralizing it that it abandons him. In this colossally complicated task, he is starting at a disadvantage. Unlike Richard Daley, who was reared among cops in the Irish-American neighborhood of Bridgeport, Emanuel grew up in suburban Wilmette, the son of an Israeli immigrant. His father was a pediatrician, his mother a civil-rights activist. He turned down a scholarship at the Joffrey Ballet and went to Sarah Lawrence College. (Among themselves, the cops call him Tiny Dancer.) I asked him if his relative distance from the police department makes it easier for him to impose tough reforms—or harder for him to get a sense of what’s going on. “I don’t know what the question is asking,” he said. “Why do you assume it’s harder?” If Emanuel didn’t realize that he had a gap to close with his police department, that would be an answer in itself. He changed tack: “Let me say this. There are benefits to it, and there are vulnerabilities to it, and that’s the truth.” For years, Emanuel has reminded reporters and voters that his mother’s brother, Les, retired as a police sergeant. “Look,” he said. “What your questions assume, which is true, is that the police department is somewhat a reflection of our city.” He went on, “I run into officers every day who say, ‘Oh, I served with Uncle Les, how’s Uncle Les?’ So there’s benefits to that. Being a foot inside but being an outsider, I can push certain changes that an insider could not. ” He ticked off projects that he hopes will begin to restore public support: “G.E. Healthcare Worldwide is coming to Chicago—an eighteen-billion-dollar company,” he said. The following day, he planned to announce $1.3 billion in funds for overhauling O’Hare Airport. I asked if reducing segregation was on his agenda, and he said that it was reflected in his investment in the Red Line, the rapid-transit system that serves the South Side. “If you want to end segregation not only in housing but in the workplace, you’ve got to have a public-transportation system that works.” He added, “I didn’t do the Red Line north in Lincoln Park and Lakeview”—two prosperous neighborhoods. Emanuel points out that he inherited many problems from Daley’s twenty-two years in office, including a budget deficit totalling $637 million, violence in low-income neighborhoods, and fraying relations between the police and the public. But that argument will carry him only so far. Chicago has a huge pension overhang that is causing middle-class families to leave the city. In the end, Emanuel’s prospects for recovery hinge partly on the ingredient that he may have the most trouble wrestling into submission: his own personality. Despite a long career in politics, most of his positions have been appointed, not elected, and as mayor he has struggled to convince voters that he is listening. When he took office, he muscled through one of his signature education goals—lengthening the school day—and distressed many public-school parents by closing fifty schools. But his steamroller treatment of opponents left him with a reputation for being high-handed and vengeful. Even five years later, people mention that Karen Lewis, the head of the Chicago Teachers Union, says that he told her, in the midst of a heated discussion over the longer school day, “Fuck you, Lewis.” And yet, for the first time in memory, the problem with a Chicago mayor was not that he was too strong but that he was too weak. Would Emanuel be able to forge the political alliances that he will need in order to address the city’s systemic problems? I brought up the subject of Pfleger, and asked Emanuel why he had so much influence in Chicago politics. “Some people are influential by the size of their congregation, the history of their congregation, and some people are influential by what their congregation and church does,” he said. “He is an aggressive voice, and I respect the moral authority of that voice.” Like Obama in his days as a Senate candidate, Emanuel needs Pfleger—now more than ever—but Pfleger may not be able to help him. Pfleger said of his congregation’s view of Emanuel, “He would get booed if he walked in here now.” In a year of political astonishments, an unlikely turn in the Presidential campaign emerged in late January, when polls began to suggest that Hillary Clinton was not the unquestionable choice of black voters. For months, her advisers had predicted that African-American support in Southern states would provide a decisive advantage over Bernie Sanders, and in national polls Clinton still leads Sanders among black voters, three to one. But the margin is smaller among the young, and Sanders has picked up prominent supporters, including Cornel West, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Harry Belafonte. In January, West, who has been one of Obama’s harshest critics from the left, passed through Chicago while campaigning for Sanders. He and Pfleger arranged to meet at the Third World Press, a black publishing house, headquartered in a converted church. When Pfleger walked in, West threw his arms around him and exclaimed, “My brother, my brother!” West was dressed in his customary attire—three-piece suit, black scarf, white shirt, French cuffs. West was midway through a barnstorming tour with Bernie Sanders. “We’ve got eleven events in just three days,” he said, pretending to faint. “We did the black-college tour at South Carolina State, jumped in the car, and drove to Tuskegee all night. Left at twelve, got there at seven, spoke at nine. We had two thousand people there. Then I jumped in the car and went to Birmingham.” He leaned toward Pfleger. “Do you know we had seven thousand one hundred people there in Birmingham?” “Well, he’s got my vote,” Pfleger said. “He’s such a serious brother,” West said. “Man, he’s for real.” In West’s telling, Clinton has disqualified herself from black support because of her ties to Wall Street and her endorsement of the 1994 crime bill (a measure that was broadly supported, at the time, by the black political establishment and by Sanders, then a congressman). Sanders, West points out, supported a fifteen-dollar minimum wage, an expansive federal jobs program, free college tuition, and single-payer health care. The Iowa caucuses were still a few days away, and West said, “Eight points ahead in Iowa!” On the spectrum of black politics, Pfleger allies himself with West, Jeremiah Wright, and Louis Farrakhan, of the Nation of Islam, whose headquarters is a few miles away. Pfleger calls Farrakhan his closest adviser, and says that they talk at least once a month. Farrakhan has made hateful statements about Jews and white America, and when I asked Pfleger about them he said, “I’ve lost friends and I’ve lost support—I’ve been disinvited from places—because of my relationship with Farrakhan.” He said that he shares many of Farrakhan’s criticisms of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, but he also hedged. “Has Farrakhan said some things that have maybe pushed the envelope too far? Certainly,” he said. “Has Mike Pfleger? Certainly.” But he added, of Farrakhan, West, and Wright, “I’d take a bullet for any of those people any day of the week.” Gerald Kellman, a Chicago community organizer, who was Obama’s mentor when Obama worked on the far South Side in the nineteen-eighties, has been active in the same neighborhoods as Pfleger for thirty years, and he considers his embrace of Farrakhan to be a “moral mistake,” a reflection of “a tremendous lack of sophistication.” Kellman, who grew up in a Jewish family outside New York City, said, “It’s sort of like working with Donald Trump.” Kellman regards it as a plainly pragmatic decision. “Pfleger is thinking about the neighborhood. He loves those people, he cares about them, so working with Farrakhan can help that,” he told me. Kellman’s larger concern is that Pfleger has not used his pulpit to help minorities mount a serious challenge. “The way that whites continue to run Chicago is they play blacks off against Latinos,” Kellman went on. “He could have been the person who could have stopped that. He could have been a lot more effective if he had stood firmer against the Democratic machine in Chicago, if he had empowered African-American leaders to do so, if he had worked with the Catholic Church, which still has an incredible amount of power. And now, because he hasn’t done that, he’s missed out on making the real change in Chicago.” As the violence in Chicago’s poor neighborhoods has grown more intractable, Pfleger’s work has carried him deeper into the world of the gangs. His foster son, Jarvis Franklin, had been in a gang but had moved away from it. On May 30, 1998, Franklin was leaving a convenience store with friends, three blocks from the church, when a man on a bicycle fired into the crowd and rode away. When Pfleger reached Franklin, he was bleeding from a wound in his neck and did not survive. “I was totally paralyzed by it,” Pfleger said. “The gang issue became very personal after Jarvis was killed.” For decades, Chicago had been home to larger, more entrenched gangs, in part because they festered in the isolation of public housing. But by the end of the nineteen-nineties the gangs had begun to change: the federal government had arrested top leaders of the Gangster Disciples and the Black P. Stones, and the demolition of public housing scattered the members. Instead of sixty long-standing gangs—some of which were run like corporations, with their own clothing lines and political-action committees—Chicago now had hundreds of “cliques,” with as few as a dozen members in control of several square blocks. The competition fuelled a surge in violence. In 2012, a mini-war erupted between members of G-ville and Killa Ward, two cliques that had staked out territory near the church. By late September, twenty-seven people had been shot in that area, according to a Tribune report on the violence. As the shootings continued, Pfleger led an antiviolence march, calling out gang members by their nicknames. “I’d run down the street and say, ‘Cartoon, come talk to me! Kup, come talk to me! Stan, come talk to me!’ ” Three of them spoke to him, but he got word that Cartoon, whose real name was Phillip Dupree, was incensed. “He put a threat out on my life if I didn’t shut up talking about him,” Pfleger said. When Pfleger told me the story, one afternoon in January, we were in his office, and he was flipping through pink phone messages on his desk. He tried not to dwell on the matter. “No. 1, there’s nothing I can do about it, and, No. 2, it would begin to drive me nuts,” he said. Some good news was the fact that Dupree had recently been coming to church. Five days after Pfleger told me that story, Dupree was in a car with his grandmother, who was driving. When they pulled up to a chicken restaurant, someone approached and opened fire. His grandmother drove away and went another three blocks before crashing into a guardrail beside a hair-braiding shop. The shooter pursued them and fired again. Dupree was hit in the face and died in the car. His grandmother, who was grazed on the head, later found two bullet holes in her hat and five in the hood of her coat. As the paramedics pulled her from the car, she sent her daughter, Alfreida Cobb, two text messages. The first said “Phillip.” The next said “Dead.” Cobb teaches toddlers in an Early Head Start program. She fled to a bathroom and called her mother. There was nothing they could do for her son. She worried that the shooter might try to kill his grandmother, to avoid being identified. The family put her house on the market. Over the years, Dupree had been charged with more than two dozen misdemeanors, including gambling, assault, cannabis possession, “gang loitering,” and the use of a “forged credit card.” Less than two months before he died, he was arrested on his most serious offense, felony charges for carrying a loaded gun in a car, and for fleeing the scene. He had been in and out of court recently. When I spoke to Cobb, she said, “I’m not going to get on the news and say, ‘My son was a perfect son.’ ” She wanted people to know that he “was a loved person.” She said, “I don’t want nobody to say he took that life because he had nobody to help.” She described a family that includes police officers and access to social services. “But he had to want it,” she said. Cobb said that her son “wanted to have every shoe that comes out. He wanted to dress nice. He wanted to keep up with the Joneses.” He found odd jobs at the laundromat, the grocery store, and a men’s clothing shop, where the owner gave him his nickname because he had a tall forehead and jug ears. From then on, everyone called him Toon. “He started off positive,” his mother said. “But when you’re young, and you’re in the neighborhood . . .” She didn’t finish the sentence. Dupree wanted to be famous. On his Instagram account, he identified himself as an “Actor/Rapper.” He posted photos of himself holding guns, and photos of cash and marijuana. He found work with a cousin, as a production assistant on rap videos, which took him to Miami, Austin, Los Angeles. He once FaceTimed an uncle, Antonio Cobb, who saw palm trees in the background and asked where he was. “You wouldn’t believe it,” Dupree replied. “I’m in a Lamborghini with a Chinese man.” But the wealth was a mirage; he didn’t have much. At twenty-six, he was not married, and had four daughters. I asked Cobb if the police had discovered a motive. “No,” she said. “You know this street stuff. At the end of the day, it’s ‘gang-related.’ ” When Cobb talked about gang life, she described it in terms of things that befall you: a “web,” a “madness,” a “war.” She blamed it partly on the absences in their lives—the food deserts, the closed schools, the cutting of sports teams and after-school programs. “Once you tell them to stay off the street, where do you want them to go? Back to their mama’s house to text and get on Instagram and do negative stuff? There’s no resources in the areas where all of these wars are going on. How about learning how to read! They don’t even know what a résumé is.” At Cobb’s request, Pfleger held the funeral at St. Sabina’s. I asked him if it gave him pause. He said, “Óscar Romero was a leader of liberation theology down in South America. He was a Catholic archbishop. He was at the altar in his robe on the day he was shot and killed. His last words were ‘May God have mercy on the assassins.’ ” There was also a practical reason: “Everybody knew Cartoon was from this neighborhood. He was well known. Everybody knew what he had done, who he was.” Pfleger saw it as a chance to offer help to young men who might not usually ask for it. The funeral was scheduled for a Friday. When I arrived that morning, Pfleger was nervous. He had heard that some of the mourners were planning to retaliate. A police officer who had known Dupree and his family stopped on his way into the church to speak to three mourners who he thought were considering revenge. He told them, “It ain’t worth it.” Hundreds of people filed in. At the front of the church, Dupree lay in a silver casket with white satin lining. His wounds had been concealed. He wore a fresh gray Chicago White Sox hat. In the eulogy, Pfleger said, “I’m not going to stand here and pretend that Phillip was all that and that Toon didn’t exist.” He went on, “Toon and I had our confrontations, and Toon and I had our run-ins, but last summer, when we were out one night walking, Toon drove by and he said, ‘Can I holler at you?’ And I asked what I can do, and he said, ‘Father Mike, I’m tired. I’m tired, and I want to know if you’ll help me make a change.’ Now, I was chaplain at the county jail for almost two years, and so I’ve heard that line a lot.” The crowd laughed. “But I also know when somebody is for real.” After a moment, he made a plea to the young men in the audience—part physical and part political. “What’s it going to take to stop the madness out here?” he said, his voice rising. “I am fighting like hell to get bad cops off the street.” But, he said, it was up to the young men to “stop the killing and the shooting of each other.” He went on, “Are we going to fight and shoot and kill over blocks that have been abandoned by the city and the state and the federal government so long that some parts, they look like Third World countries?” It was time for them to confront “the real fight,” he said. “We’re going to fight City Hall. We’re going to fight the governor. We’re going to fight the President and bring some development, bring some jobs, bring some hope, bring some possibility into our community.” He was shouting now. “You can’t just say, ‘Stop the violence!’ Give me a job! Give me a way out! Give me an opportunity!” When it was all over and the last mourners had left, Pfleger went into a small room behind the altar and started putting things into a wooden cabinet marked “Funeral Materials.” I asked him if he thought that his message would have any effect. He wasn’t sure. He said, “Until we decide that we’re really going to love these brothers and help them, we’re just bullshitting them, really. ‘Stop shooting, stop killing, put the guns down.’ And pick up what?” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

A Lunar Theory of Bill Clinton,7593,"Earlier this week, Bill Clinton, who has played a more behind-the-scenes role in Hillary Clinton’s campaign than he did in 2008, made his first solo campaign appearances of the year, on his wife’s behalf. Twenty-four years after New Hampshire voters helped to resurrect his own political fortunes, Clinton was back in the state, appealing to them. At a town hall in Exeter, he gave a speech that was highly personal, offering an idiosyncratic case for Hillary from the perspective of someone who has watched her closely for more than four decades. His pitch, somewhat counter-intuitively, given her long tenure in politics, was that Hillary would be “a change maker.” Bill’s return to the campaign trail raises long-standing questions about whether he will help or hurt his wife’s candidacy. For all his successes and charms, Bill’s unique political assets are like the phases of the moon: sometimes, they have shone brightly and bathed Hillary in a warm glow; at other times, they have cast her campaigns into darkness. Bill’s entire career has been marked by this kind of electoral waxing and waning. His first twenty years in politics were notable as much for his defeats as for his victories. He lost his first election, in 1974, for a Congressional seat from Arkansas, but came back and was elected attorney general, in 1976, and then Governor, in 1978.* Voters booted him out of the governorship after a single two-year term, seemingly ending his political career, but he regained the office in 1982. After a few terms in office, he was considered a star of the Democratic Party and an obvious Presidential candidate—until he delivered a famously long-winded speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention which was met with derision by the clearly bored delegates and which one Arkansas newspaper called “an unmitigated disaster.” Less than four years later, he was the Democratic front-runner for the Presidential nomination—until, of course, his campaign was hobbled by accusations of infidelity and he was again declared politically dead. On election night in New Hampshire, in early 1992, after he secured a startling second-place finish behind Paul Tsongas, he proclaimed himself the Comeback Kid. The next two decades were similar. Elected President in the fall of 1992, he was repudiated in the midterm elections two years later, when Republicans won the House for the first time in forty years and also took control of the Senate. Clinton recovered yet again, won reëlection—and then, in January, 1998, was engulfed in a scandal related to his liaison with Monica Lewinsky, who had been a White House intern. Even before his impeachment, in December of that year, he was rising again, picking up seats in the midterm elections, an unusual feat for the party controlling the White House. He was acquitted of the impeachment charges in a Senate trial, and ended his Presidency amid peace and prosperity, but Al Gore, his anointed successor, lost the 2000 election. In 2008, Clinton was blamed for torpedoing his wife’s campaign for the Democratic nomination by recklessly attacking Obama in ways that departed from the Clinton campaign's strategy. In 2012, he was credited with delivering one of the greatest speeches of his career, again at the Party convention, and with helping Obama to win reëlection. So where in the Clinton Lunar Cycle are we today? Judging by polls, Clinton is something akin to a super blood moon right now. For the past few years, his favorability ratings have regularly been in the low-to-mid sixties, which is much higher than those of any candidate currently running for President, including his wife. As he returns to the fray and invites attacks from Republicans, those lofty numbers will surely decline, but he begins this election year with a deep reserve of political capital and a large majority of Americans recalling his Presidency with fondness. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" That’s good news for Hillary. Her two greatest political obstacles are that many Americans do not trust her and that she represents the past more than the future. There’s probably not much that she can do about the trust issue. How voters view her character is more or less set and has been constant for many years. There’s not much new information that Republicans are likely to be able to give voters to make their perceptions of her more negative, and there’s probably not much new information that she can give voters to make them feel more positively about her. She has a high floor and low ceiling when it comes to how the electorate views her personally. Her strategy, as it was in her 2000 Senate campaign and her 2008 Presidential campaign, is to dismiss talk about her character and move the conversation to the much safer ground of policy. But there’s more opportunity for her when it comes to beating back accusations that she is a political retread who has little to offer for the future. And that’s the argument Bill tried to respond to this week, when he described her as “a change maker.” Change, he seemed to say, does not have to come from someone who is new on the scene. What’s more important is whether that person has experience making change. (There is perhaps is a hint of lingering anti-Obama sentiment in the argument, as if Bill is telling voters who are not fond of how the Obama Presidency turned out that they shouldn’t pick novelty over experience again.) Bill’s stump speech is a lengthy biography of Hillary that describes her attacking problems from her perches as a law-school student (fighting sentencing discrimination), as a lawyer (fighting for legal aid for the poor), as the First Lady of Arkansas (creating an early-education program), as the First Lady of the United States (helping to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program after her more ambitious universal-healthcare initiative died), as a Senator from New York (helping vintners and other small businesses, especially in rural areas), as Secretary of State (pushing Russia and China to agree to sanctions on Iran), and then as part of the Clinton Foundation (working on gender disparity). “Everywhere she went, she made something good happen,” Bill said. A gifted Republican opponent will have plenty to say about each of these accomplishments, but over-all Bill’s case for his wife was a strong rebuke to the idea that she has been on a cynical crusade to gain political power simply for the sake of holding it. Just as he did for Obama in 2012, Bill made a case for Hillary that was better than the candidate’s case for herself. From that perspective, now that Bill is back on the campaign trail, the biggest downside to his involvement may be that he shines so bright that he eclipses his wife—unless, that is, the moon that is Bill Clinton slips into another, darker phase. It’s happened before. *This sentence has been changed to correct when Bill Clinton ran for Congress. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Martin Shkreli and the Temptations of Self-Dealing,8521,"Afew months ago, Martin Shkreli, the thirty-two-year-old founder and former C.E.O. of Turing Pharmaceuticals, became a poster child for everything that’s wrong with American business when his company raised the price of its drug Daraprim, which is used to treat life-threatening parasitic infections, by a cool five thousand per cent. But, while Shkreli had to weather plenty of bad publicity, he had a ready-made defense: though his strategy for Daraprim may have been egregious, it was also perfectly legal. Unfortunately for Shkreli, the same cannot be said of securities fraud and wire fraud, the crimes with which he was charged on Thursday. The government’s indictment alleges that Shkreli deceived investors in hedge funds that he ran prior to founding Turing, and that he paid some of his hedge-fund investors back with money that he took from Retrophin, a biopharmaceutical company he started in 2011. (Shkreli denied the charges, and was released on a five-million-dollar bond. On Friday, he resigned as Turing’s C.E.O.) During the Daraprim uproar, Shkreli was often represented as a kind of evil genius. But what’s striking about most of the offenses the government says he committed earlier in his career is just how straightforward and unsophisticated they seem. After he started a hedge fund called MSMB Capital, in 2009, the government alleges, Shkreli didn’t tell potential investors that at a previous hedge fund, Elea Capital, he had lost all of the money that he managed. He also reportedly told investors that MSMB had an independent external auditor, which it didn’t. And when his investments at MSMB failed, the government says, Shkreli raised more money by lying about the fund’s performance. For instance, he allegedly told one investor that the fund had thirty-five million dollars in assets, when at the time it actually had seven hundred dollars in the bank. Even after MSMB had lost all of its money and had stopped trading, Shkreli was still telling his investors that the fund was doing exceptionally well. And the government alleges that he made similar misrepresentations to investors in a second hedge fund he started, this one called MSMB Healthcare. This would all amount to garden-variety fraud. More inventive was what the government alleges Shkreli did next. By early 2013, he was under some pressure. Investors in both of his hedge funds wanted their money back, but Shkreli didn’t have it, even though he’d been telling them that their investments had returned healthy profits. At this point, the S.E.C. had started nosing around. So, apparently in order to settle with the investors and avoid the prospect of his fraud becoming public, the government says that Shkreli used money and stock from Retrophin to pay them off. At first, according to the indictment, he tried to do this by having the company enter into settlements with the investors. But when Retrophin’s auditor, quite reasonably, questioned this—since Retrophin bore no responsibility for Shkreli’s hedge-fund losses—Shkreli allegedly came up with a different scheme. He had Retrophin sign sham consulting contracts with his investors and paid them off that way. The investors, needless to say, did not do any actual consulting work. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold This behavior would be a classic case of what lawyers call “self-dealing”—an executive acting in his own interests rather than in the interests of his company. There is a long line of C.E.O.s who have treated their corporations as private piggy banks. For instance, when American Apparel’s board fired Dov Charney as C.E.O. recently, one of the causes it cited was that Charney used American Apparel money to pay for his family members’ travel expenses. (According to Bloomberg, Charney’s attorney, in a letter to American Apparel’s lawyers, called the allegations baseless and argued that the company was aware of the expenses.) That would be self-dealing on a relatively small scale. More grandly, after Conrad Black, the erstwhile Canadian-born media mogul, was dismissed as the C.E.O. of Hollinger International, a company investigation found that he had used the company to pay for personal use of company jets and household staff, as well as shelling out millions of dollars for a collection of F.D.R. memorabilia while he was working on a biography of the former President. (At the time, Black’s spokesman dismissed the report as “exaggerated claims laced with outright lies.”) And in one of the biggest corporate scandals of the late nineteen-nineties, the Rigas family, which had founded the cable company Adelphia Communications, used Adelphia’s money to build themselves a golf course, invest in a film produced by one of the Rigas children, and help to finance the family’s purchase of the N.H.L.’s Buffalo Sabres. Self-dealing is tempting for company founders. After all, these are their companies, so it almost seems as though, when they’re caught, they’re being accused of stealing from themselves. But what the executives who have got into trouble for this have either failed to understand or willfully ignored is that, once you bring on other shareholders, a company is no longer truly yours. Even if you own a majority of your company, corporate rules forbid you from enriching yourself at the expense of minority shareholders. Once you take other people’s money, you owe them a fiduciary duty. In theory, everything you do at that point, including the business strategies you follow, has to be justified in terms of the company’s business. That’s why Mark Zuckerberg, even though he has complete voting control over Facebook, couldn’t have had the company simply donate billions of dollars to his foundation. That would have been a breach of his fiduciary duty to all of Facebook’s other shareholders. Shkreli doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who worries about the niceties of corporate governance. And his alleged self-dealing at Retrophin is a perfect example of why this behavior is problematic: in the absence of rules preventing such practices, it would be far too easy for founders to loot the companies they run and leave other shareholders in the lurch. Indeed, in his purported use of sham contracts to defraud his own company, Shkreli has something in common with the most storied—and probably the most lucrative—example of self-dealing in American history: the Crédit Mobilier scandal of the eighteen-sixties and eighteen-seventies. In 1864, after Union Pacific got the charter to build the western part of the transcontinental railroad, it outsourced the actual laying of the track to a company called Crédit Mobilier of America, which conveniently happened to be owned by the Union Pacific’s biggest stockholders. Crédit Mobilier then massively overcharged Union Pacific for the construction of the railroad, allowing Union Pacific’s founders to line their pockets at the expense of their own company (and the government, which ultimately ended up footing the bill). That’s pretty much what Shkreli is accused of doing with Retrophin, only in his case the money allegedly went to his defrauded investors instead of directly into his own pocket. There is one particularly bizarre twist to this story, however: when Shkreli started Retrophin, he helped fund it with an investment of millions of dollars of the money he was managing for MSMB Healthcare, and with additional money he solicited from some of the very investors who had already invested in his hedge funds. So if the government is right, Shkreli ended up paying his investors back, in part, with money they themselves helped provide—a perfect circle of self-dealing fraud.

Can Selling Insurance to Patients Transform Health Care?,8656,"This is the second essay in a three-part series looking at problems and solutions in the health-care marketplace. Read part one, on the main issues with the existing insurance system, here. On the sixth floor of the historic Puck Building, in SoHo, are the headquarters of Oscar, a two-year-old startup that sells health insurance to individuals. The office, like the building’s Shakespearean namesake, has a certain playfulness: the walls double as chalkboards, kegs of beer round out the kitchen, and the names of the conference rooms refer to famous Oscars, including one called Bluth, after the “Arrested Development” character. “We want to introduce people to the idea of great health insurance,” announces a credo printed on one wall. “By being simple. By being thoughtful. By being friendly.” Oscar is one of several health-insurance companies to emerge in the past few years with the ambition of reinventing the industry. The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010, created an unprecedented opportunity to change how Americans purchase and consume health care. The A.C.A. has made health insurance mandatory, creating a captive market. It has introduced the health-insurance exchanges, giving people who were previously uninsured an easier way to get coverage. It has accompanied a rise in the popularity of high-deductible plans, which charge lower annual fees but require greater out-of-pocket contributions, prompting consumers to be more judicious about how they seek care. And it has initiated a shift in reimbursement to health-care providers from rewarding volume to rewarding value, creating financial incentives for providers to reduce unnecessary spending. The question now, five years after the A.C.A. was passed, is how the health-insurance industry should evolve. In the past few years, two noteworthy approaches have emerged, addressing different aspects of the insurer-provider-patient triad. The first focusses on building a relationship between insurers and patients, capitalizing on the opportunity offered by the exchanges. The second attempts to forge financial alliances between insurers and providers. While both seek to improve the system, they reflect different strategic bets on where it is most amenable to innovation, and how insurers can have the greatest impact in the short-term. Oscar, which sells insurance on the individual exchanges, is one of the most visible examples of the direct-to-consumer approach. In September, Google’s growth-equity fund announced a $32.5-million investment in the company, bringing its total valuation to $1.75 billion. From Oscar’s sleek Web design to its colorful cartoon advertisements to its homepage U.R.L. (hioscar.com), the company’s clear hope is to attract customers by making something that is ordinarily unpleasant seem more palatable. It has amassed some forty thousand members in New York and New Jersey, where it currently operates, and plans to expand to Texas and California this November. Some critics have questioned whether Oscar’s clever marketing is simply a veneer for a traditional health-insurance plan. But Mario Schlosser, the C.E.O. of Oscar, told me that he sees the marketing as key to creating a different kind of insurance. “We have an asset, which is a membership base that is very engaged,” Schlosser said. That engagement allows the company to offer creative incentives to influence patient behavior in positive ways. Last year, for instance, Oscar began giving some members a monetary reward for getting a flu shot. Twice as many patients in that group signed up for the vaccine, as compared to Oscar patients who were not offered a reward. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Oscar was also the first health-insurance company to offer members free unlimited access to telemedicine, a move Schlosser told me has minimized unnecessary office and emergency-room visits. An evaluation for abdominal pain would traditionally cost the company more than a thousand dollars; using telemedicine, it costs fifty-seven. And patients, who pay nothing at all, avoid considerable out-of-pocket costs. “It’s really being utilized by our members,” Schlosser told me. “Even though we pay for these visits, they over-all appear to be saving costs for the entire system, as opposed to costing more.” The direct-to-consumer strategy has its challenges, though. For one, prices have to be competitive for a company to win over market share—a strategy that can be difficult to sustain, particularly for startups that lack sufficient capital to buffer their losses. In hopes of promoting healthy competition, the government has sponsored a number of “consumer operated and oriented plans” (CO-OPs), non-profit organizations that, like Oscar, sell insurance on the exchanges. In September, regulators announced that they were shutting down Health Republic Insurance of New York, the largest of the CO-OPs. The company had lost more than fifty million dollars in the first half of this year. So far, eight CO-OPs across the country have closed their doors, and many more are dealing with financial losses and lower-than-expected enrollment. Another limitation of the direct-to-consumer approach is the size of the market. Last year, only seven million individuals bought coverage through an exchange, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that, over the next five years, enrollment will plateau below twenty-five million. By contrast, a hundred and fifty million people were insured through their workplace last year. It’s possible that this imbalance could shift—for example, if more employers were to adopt “private” employee-dedicated exchanges and give workers a fixed allowance to spend on a plan of their choice. A Kaiser Family Foundation report published this year indicated that while only two per cent of workers are currently enrolled in a private exchange, one in five employers are considering the model. By creating demand “from the ground up” among employees, Schlosser told me, Oscar hopes that eventually it, too, can expand into the employer market. While customer choice is typically considered a good thing, the direct-to-consumer market’s reliance on autonomy can also be a problem. When I became a doctor, I struggled to choose between just two plans that my employer had pre-selected for me, and research suggests that, in general, consumers make worse decisions when they are given too many options. “Throwing your employees to an exchange is not consumerism. That’s abdication,” Ali Diab, the co-founder of a company called Collective Health, which helps employers design and implement custom health plans, told me. “These are employees who you’re expecting to be engaged and productive at work, not benefits experts.” Perhaps the most serious criticism of the consumer-focussed strategy is that, no matter how well executed or widely adopted it is, it will do little to address the larger issue of rising health-care expenses. That’s because complex and chronic diseases drive the greatest share of costs, and providers still control most spending decisions where these illnesses are concerned. A 2013 survey on medical expenditures conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that five per cent of the population accounted for nearly half of all health-care spending. Improving outcomes and decreasing costs for the sickest patients will take more than slick technology and a friendly interface—it will take close coördination with providers, adjustments to how they are compensated, and system-wide changes in clinical practice.

Silicon Valley’s Big T.P.P. Win,8185,"When we talk about trade, we often think about material goods. News articles on the subject are illustrated with images of ships weighed down with big, corrugated containers, presumed to be filled with shoes, tires, cell phones, apples. And much of the discussion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal announced earlier this week between the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Chile, Brunei, Singapore, and New Zealand, has focussed on the movement of such goods across borders. But on Monday, after the deal was announced, some in the tech industry were fixated on a more of-the-moment aspect of the deal: its regulation of the movement of digital information—the substance of our music streams, financial payments, online communications, and just about everything else we do on the Internet. Among the people interested in these details was Victoria Espinel, the president of a trade group called BSA: The Software Alliance, whose members include Apple, Microsoft, and other influential tech companies. “The ability to use data—the ability to store and analyze it and have it move back and forth across borders—is really important not just to the software industry but to the global economy at large,” Espinel told me. The Software Alliance has been concerned, in particular, that some countries require information about their citizens to be stored on domestic computer servers and not transmitted outside. Not having full access to data makes it difficult for companies to maximize the revenue that comes from digital information; it could also make it hard, in some cases, to even operate in certain countries. Espinel told me that her group lobbied officials involved in negotiating the T.P.P. to include language that would require countries to support the free movement of digital information across national borders. After the deal was announced, Espinel was cautiously optimistic. The details of the deal haven’t yet been released, and even once the pact is made public, individual countries’ legislators must pass laws putting its provisions into place. But disclosures from officials, along with private conversations between Espinel’s staffers and people familiar with the deal, suggested that the final agreement included a provision like the one the Software Alliance had sought. A fact sheet on the Web site of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative also made reference to that aspect of the agreement, touting that it protects international trade “by preserving free international movement of data, ensuring that individuals, small businesses, and families in all [Trans-Pacific Partnership] countries can take advantage of online shopping, communicate efficiently at low cost, and access, move, and store data freely.” According to the fact sheet, the deal also bans countries from requiring that foreign businesses keep their information, servers, or research facilities within their borders in order to do business there. These are, by far, the most important provisions of the deal for the Software Alliance, Espinel told me. The agreement also benefits large tech companies by eliminating import taxes on information- and communication-technology exports from the U.S., which, in some cases, are as high as thirty-five per cent. Even within Silicon Valley, though, the T.P.P.—including the provisions covering the movement of information—has been controversial. Espinel made the case that the free flow of data is good for regular people, not only corporations, because when companies can gather and analyze information about us on a global basis, they can hypothetically solve big problems—for instance, in areas such as healthcare. But Maira Sutton, a global-policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which describes itself as a defender of Internet users’ civil liberties, was more circumspect about the development, arguing that it could prevent the passage of laws that benefit Internet users. “There are ways that it’s great—but at the same time, there’s a threat that these free-flow-of-information provisions can undermine data-protection rules,” she said. She pointed out that a country might want, for instance, to pass a law that requires its citizens’ health records to be kept within its borders, in order to protect their privacy, only to find that it is forbidden from doing so by the T.P.P. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Surfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made Wave Groups that represent Internet users, like E.F.F., aren’t the only ones to have voiced concerns about the pact. In May, hundreds of small tech companies signed an open letter, posted to the E.F.F. Web site, expressing concerns about aspects of the deal that could harm their business. Online publishers, for instance, were worried that the T.P.P. would make copyright law stricter, thereby making them more vulnerable to copyright-infringement accusations. A leaked draft of the deal had given them cause for concern; it included proposals that would have the participating countries establish laws extending copyright for the life of the author, plus seventy or a hundred years—longer than many countries’ copyright laws currently cover. The Web site of the U.S. Trade Representative doesn’t include details of the final deal’s copyright provisions, but it says that countries would “adopt strong copyright protections—drawn from international norms—to respect the rights of creators and establish clear protection of works such as songs, movies, books, and computer software, and to facilitate the development of new business models for distributing creative content that keeps pace with evolving technology.” It also noted that the agreement would include “an obligation that requires Parties to continuously seek to achieve an appropriate balance in copyright systems.” But without more detail, the tech companies remain concerned. Most likely, these concerns hold for some of the big players, too—especially those companies, like search engines and social-media sites, that routinely post, or allow users to publish, parts of material owned by others. It might seem strange that these corporations have avoided criticizing the deal publicly, if so, but Danny O’Brien, the international director of the E.F.F., who has worked with tech companies large and small for many years, suggested to me that this could be because they preferred to have their lobbyists voice their objections in the negotiations, behind closed doors. He told me: They now have access to levers of power that go beyond external public advocacy. T.P.P. has had no access for wider public involvement, but a big open door for companies. To walk through that door, you have to buy into the legitimacy of that process, and it’s the process that a lot of people—including us—are upset about. Once you’re in there: well, it’s a trade agreement. Behind those doors, they trade. All of this indicates, on the one hand, that though the information-movement provisions marked a clear victory for the big players in the tech industry, the scorecard could be more mixed than it appears. But is also suggests that, regardless of what the details of the agreement ultimately show, the T.P.P. may mark another kind of success for Silicon Valley’s most powerful companies—demonstrating that, after years spent gaining access to places like Washington and Brussels, they now have more in common with the large multinational corporations that trade in tires and apples than with the startups headquartered down the road.

Dollars to Disasters: The Gamble of Emergency Relief,18511,"In the Himalayas, many houses are built of fieldstone: shale and slate, pried from the earth, stacked in the mountain air, and mortared with mud and hay. This was the type of home that crashed down on Aimoj Tamang, an eighty-six-year-old Nepalese woman, on April 25th, the day when, in twenty seconds, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale destroyed much of what was man-made in Nepal and killed more than eighty-five hundred people. For three hours, Tamang lay trapped beneath the rubble, thinking about her children and grandchildren. She had been born in a house not three miles distant, which had also been destroyed by a natural disaster—a landslide that struck when she was a child. As an adult, she’d farmed millet on the same green terraces as her parents, in Paticho, a close-knit Christian village of three hundred people, only rarely leaving the valley where she was born. Tamang’s son-in-law eventually arrived and freed her from the rubble, then carried her home. The next day, some men from the Nepali Army arrived and asked her to consent to evacuation by helicopter, which was the only way in or out of Paticho aside from steep stone paths. Her feet were crushed, the bones revealed. She swatted the men away with a stick. Eventually, they left her. Nine evenings later, Ryan Paterson, a thirty-six-year-old E.R. doctor and experienced mountaineer from Denver, arrived at Tamang’s house and made the same request. Her wounds were now infected, and Paterson believed that she would die if she didn’t receive treatment. By iPhone and headlamp light, he and Jake Dutton, a New York City paramedic and firefighter, carried Tamang from her wooden shack into the family’s muddy yard, where a hobbled water buffalo backed away as they lay her down. Paterson began the long and sometimes painful process of cleaning, anesthetization, debridement, stitching, splinting, and dressing. As he worked, Tamang tsked him, questioned him, and clutched a pack of Khukuri cigarettes beneath her sari. She continued to refuse evacuation. For the next week, Paterson visited her every morning, discovering each time that she had removed the splints he’d applied the day before. Even so, by day two she was referring to him teasingly as “my son.” He, in turn, called her “grandmother.” She was his most serious case, and he talked about her often that week. She was tough, he said, but she might not make it, no matter what he did. Which was a lot. If they’d been in Denver, members of his team estimated, the care they were providing Tamang alone would have cost perhaps a hundred thousand dollars. As it was, NYC Medics, the Harlem-based charity that organized the trip, had spent more than twenty-three thousand dollars to equip and transport Paterson and the others to Nepal, and they’d brought with them thousands of dollars’ worth of donated medicines and supplies—enough to treat approximately four thousand patients. During previous two-week deployments, in places like the Philippines, Pakistan, and Haiti, NYC Medics teams had treated thousands of people, hundreds of whom were suffering from disaster-related traumas. But during the trip to Nepal, Tamang was one of only a handful of urgent cases that Paterson’s team saw. The mission instead proved to be a lesson in real versus imagined needs in a disaster zone, and called into question the value of emergency medical intervention by foreign teams. “I try to reconcile in my head,” Paterson said toward week’s end, “is it worth coming?” Tamang, for her part, often commented that “everything happened with the blessings of Christ.” Paterson was the first doctor she’d ever seen. NYC Medics has a concise mission: the rapid provision of medical care to remote locations that have been hit by disasters. Founded by a handful of Hell’s Kitchen-based paramedics in 2005, in response to an earthquake in Pakistani Kashmir, the organization has now conducted seven relief missions, drawing on a roster of volunteer medical professionals who are prepared to deploy anywhere in the world. The government of Nepal issued a request for international assistance almost immediately following the quake on April 25th. By the evening of the 27th, when NYC Medics announced that it was mobilizing, Nepal was reporting that some eight million people had been affected, with more than forty-three hundred dead and nearly twice as many injured. “What we were hearing from the field indicated that mobile medical teams would be helpful,” Tim Tan, the medical director of NYC Medics, told me. Mountainous Nepal seemed like a particularly good fit for the group, whose members pride themselves on mobility in difficult conditions. Several among the twelve-person team formed for the mission had responded to earthquakes in Pakistan and Haiti. Two were U.S.-special-forces veterans. One of the nurses had worked as a photojournalist in Iraq, and another had been in Liberia the year before, treating Ebola patients. Paterson had been an expedition doctor on Mt. Everest. NYC Medics agreed to let me join their trip to report on what I saw. (I paid for my own travel to Nepal, though, once in the mountains, I shared food and transport with the team.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" The team was delayed leaving New York because of a ticket mix-up, and plans soon went further awry. The morning after we arrived in Kathmandu, everyone met with Anil Parajuli, the founder of Himalayan Healthcare, a local charity that NYC Medics was partnering with for the mission. The original idea, per Nepal’s Ministry of Health, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization, which were coördinating relief missions, had been to go to Barpak, a village of about twelve hundred homes near the quake’s epicenter, in the Ghorkha district, approximately a hundred miles from Kathmandu. But as it happened, a doctor friend of Parajuli’s was already in Barpak, and he said that the area was well served by the Indian Army. Fearing redundancy, Kathy Bequary, the director of NYC Medics, agreed that the team might be more effective in a different district. Parajuli suggested Jharlang, where H.H.C. traditionally worked and where his contacts described widespread destruction and an absence of aid. “There is chaos going on,” he told the team. Though Jharlang was only eighty miles or so from Kathmandu, as the crow flies, it was a two-day trek from the nearest road, and many of the trails were compromised. Some five thousand people were potentially in need of care, and no one, to Parajuli’s knowledge, had delivered any aid to them since the quake. Bequary cleared a new plan with the health ministry: the team would drive three hours west, to Dhading Besi, the district capital, then take a half-hour helicopter ride into the mountains. Arriving in Dhading Besi toward midday, we saw some severe destruction. The U.N. was estimating that as many as eighty per cent of the houses in the affected districts were damaged or demolished, and it had requested four hundred and twenty-three million dollars for urgent response. Only a small portion of that amount—itself a fraction of the five to ten billion dollars the country will require to rebuild—had been donated. (As of now, four months after the quake, more than three billion dollars has been pledged by donor governments.) There were, however, at least eighty foreign medical teams registered in the country. The influx of humanitarian workers was large enough to be causing delays at Kathmandu’s airport, not to mention coördination issues countrywide. The office of Nepal’s U.N. Resident Coördinator issued a warning: “Since several agencies are fielding needs assessment teams, a need for better coordination is necessary to avoid overlap and misunderstanding.” Most of the misunderstandings seemed to revolve around helicopters, which were in high demand. Parajuli had told the team that transportation to Jharlang would ultimately be up to the district health officer, who was coördinating with the Indian and Nepalese armies. Bequary stopped in at the local health office, where she soon learned that official priority had shifted from medical care to the provision of food and shelter. While they waited for two helicopters to become available, the team camped on the edge of Dhading Besi’s town green, increasingly frustrated. Their immediate neighbors, from India’s 60th Parachute Field Hospital, didn’t understand the hurry. “These people are going eight days late,” Sergeant G. H. Marathe said, as he lounged in the shade of a bandstand opposite Paterson’s tent. “All the people they want to save will be dead.” The team had been concerned about this, too. Most earthquake fatalities occur in the first seventy-two hours, and it was now nearly nine days later. They briefly considered setting up in Dhading Besi, but the Indian Army seemed to be meeting the town’s needs. Bequary began calling charter services, and learned that a private flight to Paticho would cost twelve thousand dollars. “You could build and staff a clinic for a year with that. It’s fucked up,” Dave Young, an emergency-medicine doctor from Denver, remarked. The next day, the team finally caught a free ride on a pair of Indian Army helicopters that were making supply drops. At touchdown, Paticho greeted the team in force. Perhaps half of the houses dotting the green terraces above and below the drop zone had been torn open to the elements or collapsed. Accompanied by a large crowd of villagers, who insisted on carrying the gear, the team soon set up their clinic amid the ruins of the local school. Patients began arriving immediately. Health services in rural Nepal—where the per-capita G.D.P., of six hundred and ninety-eight dollars, is the second-lowest in Asia, not far above Afghanistan’s—are rare and rudimentary. Lightly trained government health workers occasionally pass through Paticho, but the nearest doctors are usually in Dhading Besi. In the first twenty-four hours, the team treated two hundred and forty-two people from the village and surrounding area. They soon learned that scores of people had already been evacuated from the area by either the Indian or Nepalese army. This was the first indication the team received that any other support had been there before them. The trauma victims, it seemed, were already dead or gone. That night, though, they found Aimoj Tamang a little way down the mountain. And they were making a difference to Paticho residents; all of the people I spoke with were glad that the doctors had come, even if, as they mentioned, shelter had become a more pressing concern. Monsoon season was approaching, and they needed tarps, and sheets of corrugated iron, to rebuild their roofs. The Nepalese Ministry of Health had, by then, requested that no more foreign medical teams fly in. “We do not need any more foreign personnel, but we definitely need the commodities,” a senior official told a reporter. The team was in good spirits for a while, but on their second full day, the patient count slowed dramatically and they began operating far below capacity. In conversation with Parajuli in Kathmandu, they decided to start sending mobile groups out each morning, trekking to villages where they might find others in need of care, especially any remaining trauma patients. On the fifth day, I joined one of the treks. Our guide, Yuan Tamang (no relation to Aimoj; Tamang, a minority ethnicity and language, is the surname of almost everyone in Paticho), was employed part-time by H.H.C.; he led us from house to house, along the valley’s narrow paths. The patients on the trek, like those at the clinic, had only rarely suffered injuries in the quake. Up and down the valley, Paterson dispensed albuterol for respiratory problems, Tylenol for arthritis, and all of the anti-fungal and anti-worm medication that he had. Though he was evidently frustrated with the team’s placement, he remained upbeat, listening to everyone’s stories and joking with the children. One woman who complained of insomnia had, Paterson discovered, lost her daughter to a falling boulder. He sat with her for a while in the makeshift refugee camp that was now her home, attempting to comfort her. “We talk about the resources being used,” he remarked to me afterward, “but we don’t talk about the value of just being here.” When we returned to camp, we learned that some doctors from Médecins Sans Frontières had passed through Paticho. They were camped on the other side of a nearby landslide, perhaps two hours’ walk away. Apparently, they had arrived two days after the earthquake and were registered with the U.N. and the Ministry of Health. They weren’t on any list that Bequary had seen. Faced with this news, the team began to consider alternate plans, including trekking out to Dhading Besi and treating people along the way, or flying back early to Kathmandu and handling patients there. Bequary tried to arrange an early relocation, but couldn’t, so the team stayed to treat what patients remained. Around the village, some modest rebuilding began, stone by fallen stone. Four days before NYC Medics was scheduled to leave the country, an aftershock hit. The team had already packed up the clinic and were waiting for a helicopter when the vibration began. Across the valley, plumes of dust rose behind new landslides. The noise was tremendous. The shock, at its most intense, was dreamlike—difficult to recall, except for the deep, adrenalized unease that it evoked. The quake, which reached 7.3 on the Richter scale, constituted a major seismic event. Across the country, more than a hundred people were killed. No one in Paticho required care though, so, following Paterson’s lead, everyone worked on clearing the many piles of rubble instead. By the time the team left that week, Nepal’s Ministry of Home Affairs was reporting that, countrywide, nearly five hundred thousand houses had been destroyed, nearly seventeen thousand people had been injured, and more than eight and a half thousand had died in the quake and the aftershock. During its mission, NYC Medics had treated six hundred and thirteen people, and only twelve for trauma injuries. But Aimoj Tamang would not be counted among the dead. Several people mentioned to me, over the course of the trip, the pleasure they derived from disaster relief, despite the frustrations and the knowledge that it might not be the most effective use of resources. “I enjoy the work. It’s satisfying,” Micaela Theisen, the nurse practitioner who had recently treated Ebola patients in Liberia, said, adding, “but I think primary health work is better for the community.” NYC Medics has conducted a teaching mission in Kenya in the past, and Bequary told me that she’s interested in having the organization do more work developing health-care systems abroad. Theisen works in both areas, as does Paterson, who is planning to return to Nepal in November to teach. Another team member, the physician assistant Eric Holden, has returned annually to Haiti since his deployment with NYC Medics there in 2010. “It takes an earthquake to get people to care about primary care,” he told me. This is a fundamental dilemma of disaster relief: preparedness is more effective than response, but it is also more difficult to staff and fund. “Across the relief effort, money could have been better used,” Buddha Basnyat, the medical director of the Nepal International Clinic, told me back in Kathmandu. He singled out the need for systemic investments such as health surveillance and vaccination. NYC Medics’ expedition budget could have bought a lot of vaccines, it’s true, but it’s difficult to say whether the decision to undertake an emergency expedition was, in some sense, wasteful. Finding an answer to that question would entail the fraught calculation of a “cost-effective” amount of money to spend on prolonging the lives of people affected by a disaster. Even though the Nepal mission was inefficient compared to NYC Medics’ past forays (and, probably, compared to the operations of some N.G.O.s that arrived earlier), the organization saved at least one life and helped many other people. It was at an average cost per patient that was higher than the cost of preventive treatment alone, yes, but one far below what comparable care would have cost in the U.S. Not long after I returned from Nepal, I met again with Tim Tan, the organization’s volunteer medical director, at a café near New York’s Presbyterian-Columbia hospital, where he was then working as an E.R. physician. Tan, who also researches medical cost-efficiency and has a degree in public health, told me that he rates the efficiency of international disaster relief, generally, as a two on a scale of ten. “Full of inefficiencies, questionable agendas, misaligned motivations, and politicking,” he wrote later, in an e-mail. Even so, he believed that the Nepal mission had been worthwhile. “I can’t deny that fewer logistical delays or higher patient volumes would have been welcomed by everyone on the team,” he concluded, “but when we can undeniably save some lives, even if only a handful per deployment, while also easing suffering and providing hope for many others, I feel that the cost is justified.” Tan was about to work an overnight shift, and when we finished up I walked with him to the hospital. Outside the E.R., he described the myriad non-life-threatening complaints he encountered during a typical shift, compared to the number of trauma cases. Working in a disaster zone changed that ratio, he said, but didn’t reverse it. It was the irony of all emergency medicine, he observed: “Most of the time, we don’t deal with emergencies.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Obamacare Survives the Scalia Treatment,6406,"“Understatement, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!” Judge Antonin Scalia writes in his dissent in King v. Burwell. Just a few lines later, he disproves his own maxim, by declaring, “Impossible possibility, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!” In case anyone missed it, the A.C.A. survived yet another politicized legal challenge, this time by a 6–3 margin, and Scalia, who was joined on the losing side by Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, wasn’t happy. Amid successive pages littered with terms like  “absurd,” “bizarre,” “interpretive jiggery-pokery,” “outlandishness,” and—invoking Will Rogers—“pure applesauce,” he fits in a third strained Shakespearean refrain: ""Contrivance, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!” Has anyone done a statistical analysis of the use of exclamation points by the Justices? And what has Scalia held back for a possible dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges, the same-sex-marriage case expected to be decided in the next day or two? When Scalia’s rants took a form, it was with this question: ""Who would ever have dreamt that 'Exchange established by the State' means 'Exchange established by the State or the Federal Government?’ ” This was the issue at the heart of the case, and it has a fairly simple answer: every member of Congress who debated and voted on the law, whether for or against. Section 36B, from which that phrase is drawn, deals with tax subsidies for certain lower-income people. In earlier versions of Obamacare, the idea was that they would buy their insurance through exchanges set up by the state in which they lived. When the possibility arose that not every state would set one up, Congress added provisions for the federal government to set up a backup exchange—and everyone assumed that the people who bought their insurance there would get the subsidies, too. In most sections of the law, the language makes it perfectly clear that the exchanges are effectively the same. In section 36B, though, a single sentence is ambiguous. Opponents of Obamacare identified this ambiguity, and sued. If the plaintiffs had won they would have accomplished three things. First, they would immediately have made health care unaffordable for almost seven million Americans, most of whom did not have it before the law was passed. Second, they would have economically crippled the insurance market as a whole. (As Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, points out, the different parts of the A.C.A.—the requirement that insurance companies can’t turn people away because of preëxisting conditions; the individual mandate to buy insurance; and the subsidies—are ""closely intertwined.”) Third, they would have made whole swathes of language in the Affordable Care Act read more bizarrely and absurdly than anything in the disputed sentence. Other sections that cross-reference 36B refer to subsidies and “qualified individuals"" which would not even exist if the plaintiffs had won. For example, there are intricate instructions on how to set up a tax-credit calculator for these individuals. Scalia, in his dissent, suggested that there was nothing strange about Congress constructing machinery for people who would, as he interprets the law, be nothing more than phantoms, so that they could do the math on credits whose amount would be zero. Roberts, in a footnote, described that view as “odd.” His majority opinion ended on this note: Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress’s plan, and that is the reading we adopt. The ambiguity in the sentence, the Court noted, grew out of legislative chaos in the fight to pass the bill, not from some secret scheme to give the states extra powers, as the plaintiffs had argued. Indeed, Roberts wrote that “the Affordable Care Act contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting”—and that this explained the ambiguity. (For example, there are apparently three Section 1563s.)  In other words, one of the things that has saved Obamacare, at this late hour, is that the whole thing is, in terms of its drafting, a little bit of a mess. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? This is a robust decision; Obamacare survived its previous near-death experience before the Supreme Court with only a 5–4. (Then, as now, the Chief Justice joined the Court’s four liberals; the extra vote this time came from Anthony Kennedy.) Also, the Justices could have found that this was the sort of ambiguous language that could be left to agencies, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, to interpret by issuing their own rules. That might have meant that a future I.R.S., under a different President, could change the standard for subsidies. But the Court decided that it was “our task to determine the correct reading,” and that the reading that protects the healthcare of millions of Americans was the right one. Scalia did not only attack his colleagues’ legal reasoning; he, in effect, questioned their integrity, by saying that the decision was politically driven—an example of a Court “prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites,” and “yield to the overriding principle of the present Court: The Affordable Care act must be saved.” He adds, “We should start calling this law SCOTUScare.” It is not the business of the Court, Scalia writes, to “repair laws that do not work out in practice.” But the opposite truth seems to be the problem for Scalia and his cohorts: Obamacare has worked.

The Cost of Insuring Pregnant Women,9735,"Health-insurance companies have a nickname for young adults, in their twenties or thereabouts, who don’t sign up for their own health-insurance policies; they call them “young invincibles,” a term meant to suggest that many of these people forgo coverage out of a brash faith in their own youthful hardiness. The phrase started appearing more often in the press around 2009, when Congress began debating President Obama’s proposal to insure more Americans. The economics of health insurance dictate that, in order to insure large groups of people while remaining profitable, insurance companies have to attract enough healthy people to cover the costs incurred by the ill. Before the Affordable Care Act passed, insurers and some politicians argued that one of the President’s stated goals—making it easier for people with preëxisting illnesses to sign up for health insurance—would be unworkable, partly because of the young-invincible phenomenon: not enough young, healthy adults would sign up to offset the high cost of insuring the ill. That summer, not by coincidence, several wonkish millennials in Washington decided that people in their age group should have an organization to represent them. They formed a nonprofit around this notion, calling it, cheekily, Young Invincibles. Since then, the organization has, among other initiatives, pushed for programs to make college more affordable and for federal investment in job training. It has also continued to pay attention to Obamacare. Since health-care reform went into effect, it has became clear that, at least so far, concerns about young invincibles seem to have been overstated. Insurers’ costs—and consumers’ premiums—have remained under control, partly because the government put measures in place to reduce the impact of the young-invincible problem, and partly because it turned out that the main reason young people didn’t sign up for private health insurance, pre-Obamacare, was not that they felt invincible but that insurance was so costly. Obamacare, which is subsidized by the government, helps address that. Accordingly, the young-invincible issue fell out of the headlines. Over the course of the past couple of months, though, Young Invincibles has begun perhaps its highest-profile campaign, one that has again raised questions about how young people choose whether to buy health insurance. The group has requested that officials include pregnancy in the list of life events that qualify a person to sign up for private coverage through the federal health-insurance exchange outside of the normal three-month-long enrollment period. Currently, only a small number of such “qualifying life events” (in Obamacare parlance) exist; they include marriage, release from prison, and childbirth. In February, Young Invincibles published a brief that cited the high cost of health care for mothers-to-be, which typically ranges from ten thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars for uncomplicated pregnancies. They also named several costly and risky complications that can arise from pregnancy (including preeclampsia, placental abruption, Graves’ Disease, and complications from diabetes or heart disease), and pointed out that some women may be on health plans that don’t include maternity coverage. The campaign has attracted some high-profile support. Early this month, Senator Patty Murray and thirty-six other senators wrote to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to request that Burwell “create a special enrollment period to maximize women’s access to coverage.” Days later, fifty-four members of the House of Representatives signed a similar letter. The Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to make these sorts of decisions, and Burwell said last month, after the Young Invincibles report came out, that she is open to this change. (Currently, according to Young Invincibles, no states include pregnancy as a qualifying life event for their own exchanges. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, of California, which has the nation’s largest state-run exchange, have written to officials there to urge them to change the rules.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media The argument in favor of making pregnancy a qualifying life event seems so logical, and the support for it is proving so strong, that one might wonder why it hasn’t happened already. There is, however, a sound case against doing so. One reason that the Affordable Care Act provides for only a three-month sign-up period is to prevent uninsured people from enrolling only at the moment that they suddenly need healthcare—after falling off a ladder, for instance, or getting a cancer diagnosis. (Relatedly, a limited enrollment window gives healthy people an incentive to sign up, in anticipation of future need.) The attendant problem, of an unbalanced pool that includes many customers with high costs, is known as “adverse selection.” It not only hurts insurers, but can also, in the long run, drive up premiums, as higher costs are passed along to customers. To the extent that becoming pregnant necessitates thousands of dollars of health-care spending, expanding enrollment opportunities for pregnant women could, from the perspective of insurers, be a potentially catastrophic example of the adverse-selection problem. Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, told me in an e-mail, “If individuals are incentivized only to sign up for coverage when they need care, then that has a significant impact on affordability for everyone.” Young Invincibles acknowledged this possibility in its report: “Adverse selection is a real concern in the health insurance industry and can lead to instability and/or increased costs for all consumers in the risk pool.” But the organization argues that adding pregnancy to the qualifying-life-event list wouldn’t increase insurers’ costs much—and for an interesting reason. The vast majority of pregnant women are either insured, eligible for Medicaid (which, in many states, has a higher income cut-off for pregnant women than for others), or covered by state-run insurance programs for pregnant women. A 2012 study, covering the period from 2000 to 2009, found that the percentage of pregnant women who were uninsured was around ten per cent, compared with nineteen per cent of women of reproductive age who weren’t pregnant. Since 2009, the percentage of uninsured pregnant women has almost certainly fallen, because Obamacare has both expanded Medicaid access for lower-income people and mandated that uninsured people who don’t qualify for Medicaid buy insurance, through exchanges, with improved maternity coverage. Because of these factors, Young Invincibles estimates that a “relatively small number of women” would seek health insurance through the federal exchange immediately after finding out that they are pregnant. From a practical standpoint, then, the organization and its allies are making a surprising argument: they believe that the government should allow pregnancy to count as a qualifying life event not because this would have an impact on large numbers of women but precisely because it wouldn’t. Health economists I spoke to told me that it’s difficult to estimate just how much of an impact such a policy change would have on insurers, but they agreed that it would likely be minimal. I asked Janet Currie, a health economist at Princeton University, about how many people might sign up for insurance through the federal exchange after learning about a pregnancy. She replied, “There may be a group that’s in the middle—have too much income to be eligible for Medicaid or the state programs and don’t have private health insurance—and those people may be making this calculation, but I don’t think there would be huge numbers of people signing up just for pregnancy.” As a result, she said, any potentially higher costs would probably be kept to a minimum. There remains another issue—the possibility that, if pregnancy becomes a qualifying life event, advocates for people with various health conditions could take it as a precedent to push for the Health and Human Services Department to add other health issues to the list. One could, of course, make the same argument about falling off a ladder or getting a cancer diagnosis as Young Invincibles is making about pregnancy: treatment is costly; dangerous complications can arise; some insurance plans don’t cover them. But Currie suggested one way in which pregnancy is different from other health events: though the Young Invincibles campaign focusses on women’s health, one can easily make the argument that covering prenatal care is actually a natural extension of healthcare for an infant—in other words, that prenatal care is as much for the unborn child’s benefit as for the mother’s. “Given that one’s intention when one is pregnant is to deliver a live baby,” she told me, “it seems reasonable to start healthcare before the baby is born, for the baby.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"Gavin Newsom’s Long, Long Campaign for Governor",11231,"On Wednesday morning, little more than three months after California’s voters reëlected Governor Jerry Brown for another four years, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, became the first person to declare his intention to take Brown’s place when he reaches the end of his final term at the start of 2019. “When Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly—without evasiveness or equivocation,” Newsom wrote in a letter to supporters, announcing that he is forming an official campaign committee to seek the governorship. The announcement came not longer after Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the first major candidate to declare that he will consider running for President in 2016, was experiencing one of the downsides of entering a race on the early side: it leaves you more time to screw up. Over the past few days, Bush’s political-action committee released e-mails that included some Floridians’ social-security numbers, and its newly hired chief technology officer had been forced to resign over several comments he had made in the past, including tweets that referred to women as sluts. In a phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Newsom acknowledged the potential pitfalls of his decision—he joked that he was giving opposition researchers more time to dig up dirt—but said that, rather than quietly open a fund-raising account that is purportedly meant to raise money for some other race, when everyone knows that he wants to be governor, he preferred to be forthcoming about his intentions. “Love me or hate me, at least you know where I stand,” Newsom said. “You can be coy, or you can be candid—I’d rather be candid and let people judge that. Obviously there’s not much precedent for jumping out this early, so it’s ripe for critique.” Newsom acknowledged, too, that announcing so soon lets him get an early start on raising money and articulating a platform. “So often, time and its constraints get in the way of good decision-making—like, ‘We have to get this policy paper out this week even though it might not be vetted, might not have the substance it otherwise would if we had taken more time.’ ” He added, “If I waited two years, it’d be all about raising money, raising money, raising money.” The Democratic establishment in California might be eager, too, to anoint a frontrunner early on; it’s unclear who will run against Newsom, though the state treasurer, John Chiang, and both the previous and current mayors of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa and Eric Garcetti, all Democrats, have been named as potential candidates, among others. From 2004 to 2011, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, he had—and sometimes nurtured—a spectacularly high profile. He issued licenses for same-sex marriages, in defiance of state law at the time, and instituted universal healthcare for city residents. He also slept with a top aide’s wife, went into rehab to address what he called “problems with alcohol,” and supported controversial real-estate development and homelessness programs. Nevertheless, Newsom’s legacy as mayor is one seen as having been substantial, if not universally admired. But he has barely been in the news since his election, in 2010, as lieutenant governor—a position that, he readily acknowledges, isn’t particularly powerful. “There are constraints to this office,” he told me. “You serve in these formal roles”—he sits on the University of California’s Board of Regents and on the State Lands Commission, among other positions—“and by the way those are very significant roles, they’re important, but beyond that you’re not negotiating labor contracts, you’re not signing executive orders, vetoing or approving legislation, or participating in that legislative process.” In California, the position is mostly seen as a relic of a time when, if the governor travelled out of state, it was important to have a backup in Sacramento to do business for him; now that governors can easily take care of state business even while travelling, it’s sometimes unclear what, exactly, the lieutenant governor is supposed to do. Newsom was made aware of the limits of the job early in his tenure, in 2011, when he decided to focus on economic development, even publishing a report, with input from the Brookings Institution and the McKinsey Global Institute, on how California should change its economic policies to better support growth. But Brown—the person in the best position to turn those recommendations into policies—didn’t seem much interested in adopting Newsom’s ideas, on the economy or on other matters. He cared more about balancing the state’s budget; plus, the two men, who ran against each other ahead of the 2010 gubernatorial primary, before Newsom dropped out and sought the lieutenant governorship instead, aren’t said to have a particularly warm relationship, and Newsom’s economic-development report was interpreted, in some quarters, as a challenge to Brown. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Since then, Newsom seems to have settled for quieter moves—opposing proposed tuition hikes at the University of California, for example—while biding his time. When he ran for reëlection, in 2014, the Los Angeles Times editorial board preceded its endorsement of him by calling the position a “notoriously do-little job.” The board wrote, “Being lieutenant governor mostly serves as a perch for gubernatorial candidates-in-waiting. Nevertheless, voters are asked every four years to choose among the aspirants, so here goes.” It’s little wonder, then, that Newsom—who, love him or hate him, did more as mayor of San Francisco than most—is eager to start doing something again. By the time 2018 comes around, California will have changed tremendously since 2009, the last time Newsom campaigned for governor. In some ways, his race, and the way Californians react to it, will be a proxy for that evolution. Some of those changes bode well for Newsom. The last time he ran for governor, he recalls, even his friends questioned whether his gay-marriage stunt, in 2004, would hurt him. In 2008, after all, Californians had passed the Proposition 8 ballot measure, which defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. It wasn’t until 2010—after Newsom had dropped his bid for governor—that the percentage of Californians supporting gay marriage surpassed the percentage opposing it, and it wasn’t until 2013 that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the legalization of gay marriage in the state. “His bet, and it was a courageous bet, when he was mayor, was that supporting gay rights would not be a career killer—he was right,” Bruce Cain, a political-science professor at Stanford University and a longtime observer of California politics, told me. “It’s going to be something that’s he’s going to be able to rightfully tout.” The idea of universal healthcare, once seen as radical, has also become more accepted, particularly in California, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But the California electorate is also changing in ways that may not favor Newsom. The four counties that are expected to see the greatest population growth, in absolute numbers, from 2010 to 2020, are all in Southern California—Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and Orange. The differences among the California electorate are blurry for those on the outside—they look like varying shades of blue—but they’re real; Democratic voters in some parts of the south, for instance, describe themselves as “conservative” at much higher rates than those in the Bay Area do. Southern Californians can also be mystified by—and resentful of—Silicon Valley and its solutionist ethos. Though Newsom has now won two statewide races, he is perceived as a distinctly San Francisco type, with the gel-enabled good looks, and the breezy confidence—in himself and in the power of technology to solve problems—of a venture capitalist. In 2013, he wrote a book called “Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government,” which, as George Packer wrote, in a 2013 article about Silicon Valley’s politics, includes lines like: “What if you could create competition among city services . . . through a kind of government Yelp? Then we’d be on to something.” Newsom is also, of course, white, in a state with a growing non-white population; last year, the number of Latinos in the state was estimated to have surpassed the number of white non-Latinos. “From a distance, you think, He has matinee-idol looks, he’s kind of glossy—but he comes across, in university settings, as somebody who tries to dig into things,” Cain said. “I think Gavin is a person of substance. The question is whether the changing demographics of the state and the growing resentment from Southern California of Northern California dominance is going to be a problem for him.” When I ran the notion of a North–South divide by Newsom, he acknowledged that there’s some truth to it, but largely dismissed it as “just a lot of politics.” He told me, “I have, as lieutenant governor, a moral, ethical responsibility to represent everyone in the state—including people in the rural parts of the state.” Indeed, “Citizenville” aside, Newsom has spent his time as lieutenant governor on issues with broad appeal—economic development, higher education. He said that, as governor, he would continue to represent the interests of the state at large. In his letter announcing his bid for the governorship, he wrote, “We must continue to grow our economy and create private-sector jobs, we must invest in public education and keep college affordable, we must address the widening inequalities that separate our communities and we must maintain California’s historic leadership in meeting the climate challenge.” He also promised, “This won’t be an ordinary campaign.” Newsom’s language and the timing of his announcement were reminders of the dramatic tactics he once successfully deployed as mayor, but has avoided as lieutenant governor—surely calibrated with the headlines in mind (and, this time around, the tweets). It seems to have worked, attracting more attention than he has seen in at least half a decade, and donor money may well follow. But if, in the long, long run-up to the 2018 election, he’s to win over those voters who regard his legacy as mayor with suspicion and his time as lieutenant governor with apathy, he’ll have to use the time as he says he plans to, by making considered decisions about policy positions that appeal to all Californians—and that presumably don’t mention Yelp.

"Jon Stewart, We Need You in 2016",5506,"The last hope for bringing some rationality to the 2016 Presidential field died Tuesday night when Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving “The Daily Show.” He didn’t say when—he muttered the names of a few late-2015 months, and something about working out details—but it sounds like it will be before the earliest primary. This is the first good argument that I’ve heard for making the New Hampshire and Iowa contests even earlier. Someone needs to sort out who is clumsy and who is absurd, who is semi-serious and who is wholly alarming; the Republican base isn’t going to do that on its own. And one of those characters—as Stewart might put it, the guy from Jersey, the Dr. Seuss fetishist, the Aqua Buddha ophthalmologist, the little brother of the other guy—has to get the nomination. Stewart, in his Tuesday night announcement, said, “This show doesn’t deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you.” What about the poor G.O.P.? Doesn’t Jon Stewart want to help? This is a bipartisan problem. Let’s say Hillary Clinton announces that she is running. It seems unavoidable now— just as unavoidable as the investigative pieces that will come, laying out questions about her finances and entanglements and those of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Many will be petty, and some, for Democrats, may be painful. Bill Clinton will also be out on the campaign trail. Picture that, even before you picture him back in the White House, but without a proper job. Even last time, with an abbreviated campaign, he said things that got his wife in trouble. He might also do things that have profound comedic and political implications (he has before). When all that happens, who, above the undifferentiated wail from Fox News, will calibrate the needle on the dis- scale? (That’s the one that ranges from dismissible to disappointing, to disquieting and disgusting, and on until disqualifying.) And, speaking of Fox News, who will point out, as Stewart did in the program last night, that its commentators have suddenly begun criticizing President Obama for not behaving more like an autocratic Islamic king? And who will encourage Megyn Kelly when she uses her powers for good? As for MSNBC, who will help the network to distinguish between what is actually outrageous on the right and what is politics as usual? VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Jon Stewart may not, one day to the next, drive a candidate from the field; at times, his attention appears to slightly prolong a candidate’s presence. (Herman Cain.) And his disdain can sometimes be used as a rallying point. But he is very good at making it clear when we are looking at Citizens United-funded performance art, and when what’s on stage is something, even something quite funny, approximating real politics. He made Elizabeth Warren, whom he had on as a guest many times when she was still a Harvard professor, seem most serious not by being grim himself but by making clear to the audience that the reason he so enjoyed her company was that it was awfully fun listening to someone so smart. (Vox recounts how, when Warren’s first appearance wasn’t going well, Stewart got her back on track.) Over the years, that’s how we’ve come to feel about him. But not only him, one might say. This is where, for reassurance, one might rewatch clips of John Oliver doing his Carlos Danger shimmy routine. Maybe Comedy Central is talking to HBO, where Oliver is now. One of Stewart’s triumphs has been fostering talent like Oliver. And, of course, Colbert, who recently left Comedy Central, and Larry Wilmore, Jason Jones, Samantha Bee, and Jessica Williams. It won’t be hard for one of them to be funny, but Stewart exhibited a particular genius in bringing them together and deploying them over the political landscape, and conveying that he enjoyed their company. It created a pleasure in politics itself, which is otherwise endangered in this country. Is it because Mitt isn’t running that Stewart had enough? Is it because a Bush and a Clinton are? (“The Daily Show” chyron for the 2012 Republican National Convention was “The Road to Jeb Bush 2016.”) Front-runner implosions are still possible, of the sort that would unleash the sort of ego-driven political free-for-all that Stewart seems uniquely capable of making sense of. He made it clear that he has some brittle feelings about the treatment of Brian Williams. Fine—but none of those things, one must concede, are of the sort that have flustered Stewart before. Maybe he really does need a break—couldn’t he squeeze one in the form of some long naps before the election starts, then come back? “I don’t have any specific plans—got a lot of ideas, got a lot of things in my head,” Stewart said on Tuesday night. But that is what the Republican debates are all about! And they are starting soon. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Bill,27103,"“Working in the White House on a Saturday afternoon had become routine for Zeke Emanuel and Bob Kocher,” Steven Brill tells us at the beginning of Chapter 9 of his ambitious new history of the Affordable Care Act, “America’s Bitter Pill” (Random House): But they were usually able to leave at a decent hour. However, at 5 p.m. on Saturday, April 25, 2009, they were thrown into a state of near-panic. Emanuel, Kocher, and the rest of the staff from the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council had been blindsided by the domestic policy crew. At issue was a briefing paper written by the head of the White House health-care-reform effort, Nancy-Ann DeParle. It was early in the planning stages for Obamacare, and DeParle’s memo was a three-thousand-word document, in which she made the political case for a broad expansion of coverage. Kocher and Emanuel were taken aback. They were worried about the cost of the bill. The memo was supposed to go to the President at eight o’clock that night, which gave them just three hours to respond. “Any hopes for an early departure that Saturday evening were gone,” Brill writes. By this point in the narrative, the reader is well acquainted with the cast of characters. DeParle was “a Rhodes scholar and graduate of Harvard Law School . . . a seasoned manager and savvy infighter when she had to be,” with a background in private equity. Kocher, a “Harvard-trained internist,” late of McKinsey, was “a walking encyclopedia of healthcare markets data who had an uncanny ability to turn it all into eye-opening PowerPoint presentations illustrating the dysfunction of the American system.” Emanuel was the “brashest” and most “academically credentialed of the trio of brilliant Emanuel brothers,” took “edgy” positions, and had an “MD and a PhD (in political philosophy) from Harvard, a master’s from Oxford, and a position teaching oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.” He had “brains, cunning and [a] biting persona,” and was “ready, willing and able to layer it with the self-righteousness of a guy who treated cancer patients.” The two worked with Lawrence Summers—the “celebrated Harvard economics professor” and former Harvard president—and Peter Orszag, the whiz kid out of the Congressional Budget Office by way of Princeton and the London School of Economics. Brill, a graduate of Yale and Yale Law School, tends to specify the Ivy League credentials of his protagonists up front, with the result that his book sometimes reads like the class-notes section of an alumni bulletin. Barack Obama, we are reminded, is “the former Harvard Law Review president.” Jonathan Gruber, who was a Ph.D. student of Larry Summers at Harvard, was “an outgoing guy who had the intellectual chops of an Ivy League academic without the withdrawn personality.” And so on. So there they were, Kocher of Harvard and Emanuel of Harvard blindsided by DeParle of Harvard. The evening became a blur. The two men tried desperately to alter the language of the briefing paper. But they were blocked by DeParle and her colleague Jeanne Lambrew—the “highly respected policy wonk,” who, at one of the first major congressional health-care summits, had “pushed back on the notion that the private sector could always be the answer.” The best they could do was alter a few words and phrases. Round One to DeParle. For six pages, Brill painstakingly carries the story forward. Key phrases of the memo are parsed, their implications interrogated. “These options have been presented to your senior staff, and we have developed a package that could plausibly offset the cost of reform,” DeParle wrote. But the pronoun “we,” Brill argues, was ambiguous: it included her team but not the economic team. And could one side of the White House policy staff formulate a “package” without the other side? The directive from the Oval Office was clear. “Don’t bring us your problems,” Valerie Jarrett, the President’s gatekeeper, was known to say. “Bring us your solutions.” From that Saturday evening through the following Thursday, the two sides battled. Then came the showdown: On April 30, 2009, a large group gathered with the president in the Roosevelt Room to review a PowerPoint about health-care reform. This was the meeting that DeParle’s April 25 memo had been meant to prepare the president for. But this time, the PowerPoint had been prepared jointly by the economic team and DeParle’s healthcare policy people. Peter Orszag and Larry Summers had insisted on that. In fact, Kocher, who prided himself on his McKinsey-bred PowerPoint skills, controlled the document. Kocher controlled the document. Near-history, the journalistic reconstruction of contemporary events, has come to be dominated by two schools. The first is represented by Michael Lewis. Lewis wrote about the 1996 Presidential election through the story of a Republican candidate no one had ever heard of, the eccentric millionaire Morry Taylor. “The Big Short” was an account of the financial crisis told through the eyes of four obscure short-sellers. Lewis’s interest is psychological and moral. His books have won him many admirers (including me) because they offer deceptively simple narratives in the service of a grand canonical theme. “Liar’s Poker,” which recounts the young Lewis’s stint in the Wall Street of the nineteen-eighties, is Daniel in the lion’s den. “Money Ball,” about the strategies of small-market baseball teams, is David and Goliath. “The Blind Side” is the Good Samaritan. “The Big Short” is Noah’s Ark, and “Flash Boys” is Jesus casting the money changers out of the temple. The second school is associated with the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Woodwardian history is kaleidoscopic. The reporter makes many telephone calls and office visits, and reads many documents. All key players are represented and events detailed. The approach is sociological: the great theme of the Woodward school is the interaction of institutions and vested interests. In a Lewis, if you remove the titles of the characters and simply identify them by their first names, nothing is lost: an individual’s character, not his position, is what matters. In a Woodward, the opposite is often true. Names may be irrelevant; titles tell you what you need to know. That is what makes Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s “All the President’s Men” a masterpiece: its great achievement was to show how the institutional power of the White House led to the President’s personal corruption. The Lewis brings drama to what we thought was prosaic. But when the underlying subject is inherently dramatic, and when the heart of the story lies behind doors that only dogged reporting can unlock, the Woodward is what we need. You don’t want Michael Lewis on Watergate. He’d get distracted by Rose Mary Woods and would never make it into the Oval Office. “America’s Bitter Pill” is Brill’s attempt at a Woodward. The book is wrapped in the presumption of controversy: reviewers who received early copies had to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The reporting is exhaustive. Brill tells us that he interviewed “243 people—many of them multiple times—over twenty-seven months.” When Brill informs us that Valerie Jarrett likes to use the common managerial adage “Don’t bring us your problems; bring us your solutions,” he states that his source for this fact is the testimony of “three senior members of Obama’s staff.” Next comes a footnote: Although Jarrett declined comment, assistant press secretary Eric Schultz denied this account offered by these senior Obama advisers, saying, “Valerie doesn’t use this phrase and regularly reminds our staff that the president and our senior team don’t like surprises, to further encourage staff to bring to their attention both problems and solutions.” Then, in an appendix, Brill presents the text of questions that he submitted to Obama, including: I am told by five people who have served in senior capacities in the Administration that Ms. Jarrett often told them that “the President wants you to bring us your solutions, not your problems.” . . . I feel compelled to ask you to comment on that. Note how the three sources he interviewed in the text have now grown to five. Between the writing of the main text and the completion of the appendix, apparently in the belief that he had not fully explored the issue of Jarrett’s directive, Brill kept on going, enlisting one senior Administration official after another—up to and including the President—in his quest to resolve the Solutions vs. Solutions and Problems conundrum. Brill wants to take us behind the locked door. “America’s Bitter Pill” consists of a series of parallel stories. Brill gives us case studies of Americans whose lives have been devastated by outrageous medical bills. He describes the launch of Obamacare in Kentucky; the early days of Oscar, a health-insurance startup in New York City; and his own terrifying experience with a life-threatening aortic aneurysm. Each of these stories orbits his central narrative, “the roller-coaster story of how Obamacare happened, what it means, what it will fix, what it won’t fix, and what it means to people.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? Brill’s intention is to point out how and why Obamacare fell short of true reform. It did heroic work in broadening coverage and redistributing wealth from the haves to the have-nots. But, Brill says, it didn’t really restrain costs. It left incentives fundamentally misaligned. We needed major surgery. What we got was a Band-Aid. One of Brill’s examples is drug prices. While he was working on his book, he writes, “a drug called Sovaldi burst onto the scene.” Sovaldi is used for hepatitis C, and its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, has priced it at a thousand dollars per pill—which comes out to eighty-four thousand dollars for a course of treatment. Brill quotes Sarah Kliff, who writes on health-care policy, pointing out that California might well end up spending more on Sovaldi for its Medicaid patients than it does on all K-12 and higher education. “The exact price Gilead chose for Sovaldi said something in and of itself about the nonexistent regulatory environment drug companies knew they faced in the United States,” he writes. “Rather than set the price at, say, $989 or $1,021—at least to create the impression that it was based on some calculation other than ‘Let’s charge whatever we want’—the company had chosen a simple round number, $1,000.” How can we have a solution to the health-care crisis without making any attempt to curb runaway drug prices? Medicare isn’t even allowed to negotiate directly with drug companies. “Should we be embarrassed and maybe even enraged that the only way our country’s leaders in Washington could reform healthcare was by making backroom deals with all the interests who wanted to make sure that reform didn’t interfere with their profiteering?” Brill writes, in a section structured around a series of italicized questions. “Of course. We’ll be paying the bill for that forever.” Brill devotes fifty pages to another Obamacare shortcoming, the early malfunctioning of the Web site. He originally thought that the site would be a showcase for what government could do. But, on the train back from his initial round of interviews in Washington, he glanced at his notes and realized that he had been given seven different answers to the question of who was in charge of the launch of the federal exchange, including an “incomprehensible” organizational chart with four diagonal lines crossing one another and forming a “lopsided” triangle: Should we be amazed, and disappointed, at how Obama treated the nitty-gritty details of implementing the law as if actually governing was below the pay grade of Ivy League visionaries?__ Absolutely. This failure to govern will stand as one of the great unforced disappointments of the Obama years. At the end of “America’s Bitter Pill,” Brill offers his own solution to the health-care crisis. He wants the big regional health-care systems that dominate many metropolitan areas to expand their reach and to assume the function of insuring patients as well. He talks to Jeffrey Romoff, the C.E.O. of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who is about to try this idea in the Pittsburgh area, and becomes convinced that the same model would work throughout the country. “The [hospital’s] insurance company would not only have every incentive to control the doctors’ and hospitals’ costs, but also the means to do so,” he writes. “It would be under the same roof, controlled by Romoff. Conversely, the hospitals and doctors would have no incentive to inflate costs or over-treat, because their ultimate boss, Romoff, would be getting the bill when those extra costs hit his insurance company.” Brill talks through his idea with several other prominent health-care-system C.E.O.s (“doctor-leaders,” he calls them), whose résumés are helpfully elaborated: “Glenn Steele, Jr., a former cancer surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School,” and Gary Gottlieb, the head of a Boston group “formed by the merger of the area’s two most highly reputed hospital brands, both of which were affiliated with Harvard Medical School.” A system like this, Brill estimates, based on a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, could slice twenty per cent off the private-sector health-care bill. It’s at moments like this that Brill’s book becomes problematic. The idea he is describing is called integrated managed care. It has been around for more than half a century—most notably in the form of the Kaiser Permanente Group. Almost ten million Americans are insured through Kaiser, treated by Kaiser doctors, and admitted to Kaiser hospitals. Yet Brill has almost nothing to say about Kaiser, aside from a brief, dismissive mention. It’s as if someone were to write a book about how America really needs a high-end electric-car company that sells its products online without being the least curious about Tesla Motors. In a Lewis, this wouldn’t matter so much. “Flash Boys” was criticized by some on Wall Street for mischaracterizing the world of high-frequency trading. But “Flash Boys” explicitly set out to tell its story through the eyes of a renegade trader named Bradley Katsuyama, and the test of the book’s success was whether it captured Katsuyama’s view of high-frequency trading. In a Woodward, the goal is different. A book like Mark Bowden’s “Black Hawk Down”—a Woodward that outdoes even Woodward—sets out to describe things as they actually happened, not things as filtered through one person’s idiosyncratic perspective. The currency of the Lewis is empathy. The currency of the Woodward is mastery—and nothing is more corrosive to the form than the suspicion that the author doesn’t grasp the full picture. Does the botched launch of the Web site deserve fifty pages? Maybe so. This certainly was something that felt significant at the time. But what we want to know is how much it ultimately mattered, and there is little in Brill’s reporting that sheds light on that question. The Administration built a Web site in order to give Americans access to one of the most complex pieces of legislation in history. The site had lots of bugs, in the beginning, as complicated pieces of software often do. Then the Administration fixed the bugs quickly, and the response was such that the Affordable Care Act reached its enrollment targets. “I was, like, never worried,” Brill quotes Mickey Dickerson, an expert from Google whom the Administration brought in to get the Web site on track, as saying. “It’s just a website. We’re not going to the moon.” Brill wants the Web-site saga to stand for something larger, but in the end what it seems to stand for is the fact that Web sites, in the beginning, sometimes crash a lot. The Sovaldi example is equally puzzling. A thousand dollars for a pill sounds like a lot of money. But hepatitis C is a costly disease. It’s the leading reason for liver transplants, which are among the most expensive of all medical procedures. A 2013 study published in the journal Hepatology estimated the lifetime health-care costs of the average hepatitis-C patient (when medical inflation was factored in) at more than two hundred thousand dollars. The drug regimens that came before Sovaldi didn’t work very well and had terrible side effects. Brill quotes Sarah Kliff on how much the drug will cost the state of California, but what he doesn’t mention is that Kliff followed up on her initial analysis with another that was headlined, above a picture of Sovaldi capsules, “each of these hepatitis c pills costs $1,000. that’s actually a great deal.” The problem with the pharmaceutical industry is not that it makes too many drugs like Sovaldi. It’s that it makes too many drugs that aren’t like Sovaldi, drugs whose costs vastly outstrip their benefits: cancer treatments that cost tens of thousands of dollars and extend life only minimally, or expensive me-too drugs that perform no better than cheap generics. We certainly need to be smarter about the drugs we use, and Medicare should be relieved of the congressionally mandated restrictions that make it impossible to bargain directly with drug companies. But Sovaldi targets a painful and costly disease with a substantially cheaper, safer, and more effective one-time cure. This is what we want drug companies to do. Of all the examples that Brill could have used to bolster his argument, why did he pick that one? On May 2, 2009, Brill writes, the domestic-policy group at the White House blindsided the economic team with a second memo. It concerned something called the medical loss ratio, or M.L.R. The medical loss ratio compares what an insurer earns in premiums with what it pays out in benefits. An insurer who takes in a dollar and gives back eighty-five cents has a loss ratio of eighty-five per cent. Jeanne Lambrew wanted to place a floor on every insurer’s loss ratio: if a company kept too much of that dollar—if its M.L.R. fell below eighty-five or eighty per cent, say—it should have to refund the difference to its customers. “Lambrew was certainly on firm political ground,” Brill writes. One senior White House aide called the proposal a “winner.” The rule would make it impossible for one of the economy’s least liked sectors to make excess profits. The feeling was, Brill says, that “it might end up being the single most politically appealing piece of healthcare reform.” The economic team, however, wasn’t so sure: Summers called it a “stupid idea,” and told his people to try to kill it. It was “dumb for us to cap anyone’s profits,” he said, dismissing the idea much the way the legendarily blunt Summers might have taken down a freshman economics student at Harvard who said something in class that he thought was “dumb.” Summers’s point was that an M.L.R. floor distorted the insurer’s incentives. The argument goes like this: Suppose your doctor sends you to an imaging center to get a thousand-dollar MRI. But then your insurance company calls you and says that it’s found an equivalent provider just down the street that charges two hundred dollars. This, presumably, is what we want insurers to do. The market for medical procedures lacks price transparency and competition, and it’s scandalous that insurers routinely pay thousands of dollars for an MRI scan when the true cost of the procedure, by any metric, is a fraction of that. By taking steps like this, Summers thought, insurers could finally rein in, or even reduce, health-care premiums, which had been rising faster than inflation for years. But it is also highly likely that the insurer will keep a chunk of that eight-hundred-dollar savings for itself, in the form of higher profits. The prospect of higher profits is an insurer’s incentive for going to the trouble of looking for a cheaper MRI. In other words, if insurers do what we want them to do—cut costs and rein in premiums—it is likely that their loss ratios will fall. Why, Summers wondered, would you want to penalize them for doing that? The economic team felt that health care could use a good dose of market incentives. The Lambrew-DeParle view, on the other hand, was that health care is different: the complex nature of the relationship between patients and their health-care provider is so unlike ordinary economic transactions that it can be governed only through cost controls and complicated regulatory mechanisms. When the two sides argued, they weren’t just reflecting a difference in tactics or emphasis. Their disagreement was philosophical: each held a distinct view about the nature of the transactions that take place around medical care. Brill sides with the DeParle camp. His solution for the health-care problem is to treat the industry like a regulated oligopoly: he believes in price controls and profit limits and strict regulations for those who work within the health-care world, restrictions that he almost certainly thinks would be inappropriate for other sectors of the economy. A patient, he explains at the beginning of his book, is a not a rational consumer. That was the lesson he took from his own heart surgery. “In that moment of terror,” he writes, of blacking out after his surgery, “I was anything but the well-informed, tough customer with lots of options that a robust free market counts on. I was a puddle.” But Brill spends very little time examining why he thinks this means that the market can’t have a big role in medicine, where most care is routine, not catastrophic. He just takes it for granted. And because he is not much engaged by the philosophical argument at the heart of the health-care debate, he can never really explain why someone involved in health-care reform might be unhappy with the direction that the Affordable Care Act ended up taking. He tells us who controlled the PowerPoint. But he can’t tell us why it mattered. It is useful to read “America’s Bitter Pill” alongside David Goldhill’s “Catastrophic Care.” Goldhill covers much of the same ground. But for him the philosophical question—is health care different, or is it ultimately like any other resource?—is central. The Medicare program, for example, has a spectacularly high loss ratio: it pays out something like ninety-seven cents in benefits for every dollar it takes in. For Brill, that’s evidence of how well it works. He thinks Medicare is the most functional part of the health-care system. Goldhill is more skeptical. Perhaps the reason Medicare’s loss ratio is so high, he says, is that Medicare never says no to anything. The program’s annual spending has risen, in the past forty years, from eight billion to five hundred and eighty-five billion dollars. Maybe it ought to spend more money on administration so that it can promote competition among its suppliers and make disciplined decisions about what is and isn’t worth covering. Goldhill writes: Medicare is cheaper to run than private insurance. So what? Cheaper doesn’t mean more efficient. It may be cheaper to run banks without security guards, hotels without housekeepers, and manufacturers without accountants, but that wouldn’t make those businesses more efficient. Many state Medicaid programs have, similarly, a rule that says health-care providers cannot charge Medicaid more than the lowest price they give to anyone else. If you run an MRI machine and allow a privately insured patient to get a scan for two hundred dollars instead of a thousand dollars, you have to give all your Medicaid patients MRI scans for two hundred dollars. That’s a classic “health care is different” solution to the problem of excess health-care costs: pass a law guaranteeing the “sale price” to publicly funded patients. So what’s the result? Goldhill asks. Health-care providers behave the way any market participant would under the circumstances. They don’t have sales. What incentive would the Gap have for holding a Boxing Day blowout if, by law, it would have to offer those same low prices every other day of the year? Goldhill takes a far more radical position than the economic team at the White House does. He believes that most of our interactions concerning health care are actually no different from our transactions concerning anything else: if we trust people to buy cars and houses and food and clothing on their own, he doesn’t see why they can’t be trusted to do the same with checkups, tonsillectomies, deliveries, flu shots, and the management of their diabetes. He thinks that the insurance function—inserting a third party between patients and providers—distorts incentives and raises prices, and has such an adverse impact on quality that health insurance should be limited to unexpected, high-cost occurrences the way auto insurance and home insurance are. These ideas are unlikely to make their way into policy anytime soon. But, in elaborating the market critique of the health-care status quo, Goldhill helps us understand what the argument we’re having right now is about. It is not just a political battle over Obama. It’s a battle over whether health care deserves its privileged status within American economic life. The frustrating thing about “America’s Bitter Pill” is that Brill could have taken us one step further. He has introduced us to the policymakers, to Summers and DeParle, Kocher and Lambrew. He has taken us to the Roosevelt Room, where the two sides battle for the President’s attention. But, just at the point where “America’s Bitter Pill” could have become illuminating, exploring the conceptual gulf behind all the wrangling, Brill gets restless. He wants to get on to the next page in his notebook—to the next meeting that Obama had in the Roosevelt Room, to the briefing paper about such-and-such that was sent to So-and-So, and then, of course, to the debacle of the Web site, which had bugs until those bugs were fixed. “Do you recall a memo that Peter Orszag wrote to you just after the law was passed urging you to put in charge someone with experience launching and running ventures as complicated as healthcare.gov?” Brill asks the President. He’s trying to be Woodward. It’s not as easy as it looks. “What were your reasons for not doing so? If you do not recall the memo, do you recall Peter and Larry Summers advising you to do this? . . .” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Top Five Legal Stories of 2015,5296,"It’s time for my annual year-in-review-in-advance. Here’s my take on the big legal stories of 2015. 1. Same-sex marriage comes to all fifty states. The Supreme Court has finally run out of reasons to duck this issue. Since the Sixth Circuit ruled last month that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to same-sex marriage, there is a now a clear split in the circuits on the subject. The Justices, who earlier declined to hear challenges to appeals rulings in three circuits in favor of marriage rights, now more or less have to take the case. The liberals on the Court have been afraid to get ahead of the country on the issue, but that’s not really a concern anymore. With same-sex couples able to marry in thirty-five states, and a majority of the country (according to polls) supporting their right to do so, same-sex marriage has become mainstream, almost boring. The decision will be seen, properly, as a landmark, but the real surprise is that the reaction will be so muted. Besides, the same-sex-marriage decision will give the conservative Justices a distraction from their other big case... 2. The crippling of the Affordable Care Act. The relentless legal attacks on Obamacare will finally succeed in a big way, in the case of King v. Burwell. In the case, the plaintiffs insist that the wording of the statute allows the government to subsidize health insurance purchased on the fourteen state-based exchanges but not on the federal exchange, which covers the remaining thirty-six states. It’s a tortured argument, but the case has become a convenient vehicle for those fighting an endless war on the law. The stakes are immense: the loss of subsidies, and probably insurance, for as many as seven million people. (Given my record on Supreme Court predictions regarding the A.C.A., supporters of the law should take some comfort.) For the conspiratorially minded, there is, again, a link between the two cases. A highly-publicized victory for marriage equality in the first case would give the conservatives a kind of political cover to gut Obamacare in the second. Both results would wind up helping Republicans. Opposition to same-sex marriage has become a political albatross for the G.O.P., and the Supreme Court could do the party a favor by taking the issue off the table. And destroying the signature achievement of the Obama Presidency would be cause for great Republican celebration. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist 3. The beginning of the end of the N.C.A.A. The contradictions in college sports are beginning to resonate within the legal system. One court has found that the National Collegiate Athletic Association violated antitrust laws, and one region in the National Labor Relations Board has allowed the players on the Northwestern football team to form a union. Universities and big-time coaches have been reaping millions from sports for a long time, and the players (uh, I mean the students) should soon begin to share in the bounty. There’s simply too much money sloshing around at this point to deprive the players of any cut at all. No one—no one—knows the implications of ending the current system of phony amateurism in major college sports. Indeed, there’s no guarantee that a more free-market-oriented system would be an improvement. It’s only Division 1 football and men’s basketball that turn a profit (and even then only at certain universities). The risk to smaller sports, especially those played by women, is considerable. Perhaps football and men’s basketball will simply evolve into the semi-pro leagues that they already are, and the rest of college sports will discover ... amateurism. 4. A standoff on the law of sexual assault. Few legal issues drew as much attention in 2014. The appalling story of Bill Cosby’s alleged multi-decade reign of terror (which he and his lawyers have alternately refused to comment on and denied) joined an ugly procession of stories about sexual assaults on university campuses. But there was also the collapse of a Rolling Stone exposé about the University of Virginia and, more importantly, if less sensationally, questions raised about the fairness of some of the new codes on college campuses. (Those concerns were spelled out in this letter by members of the Harvard Law School faculty.) The issue is intractable, and the solutions are less than clear. Focussed attention on the issue may be a positive step in itself. Finally, of course, there is my annual prediction, one that is guaranteed to come true every year... 5. Celebrity arrest. A celebrity will be arrested. Analysis will ensue. Year in review: New Yorker writers look back on 2014. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

G.O.P. Unveils Immigration Plan: “We Must Make America Somewhere No One Wants to Live”,2249,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled his party’s long-awaited plan on immigration on Wednesday, telling reporters, “We must make America somewhere no one wants to live.” Appearing with House Speaker John Boehner, McConnell said that, in contrast to President Obama’s “Band-Aid fixes,” the Republican plan would address “the root cause of immigration, which is that the United States is, for the most part, habitable.” “For years, immigrants have looked to America as a place where their standard of living was bound to improve,” McConnell said. “We’re going to change that.” Boehner said that the Republicans’ plan would reduce or eliminate “immigration magnets,” such as the social safety net, public education, clean air, and drinkable water. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   The Speaker added that the plan would also include the repeal of Obamacare, calling healthcare “catnip for immigrants.” Attempting, perhaps, to tamp down excitement about the plan, McConnell warned that turning America into a dystopian hellhole that repels immigrants “won’t happen overnight.” “Our crumbling infrastructure and soaring gun violence are a good start, but much work still needs to be done,” he said. “When Americans start leaving the country, we’ll know that we’re on the right track.” In closing, the two congressional leaders expressed pride in the immigration plan, noting that Republicans had been working to make it possible for the past thirty years.

Is China Really Going Green?,8689,"To most people, myself included, this week’s agreement between the United States and China on tackling climate change came as a big surprise. For more than a decade, the Chinese government has resisted international calls for it to place a cap on carbon emissions, arguing, with some justification, that its first priority was industrializing its economy, expanding its G.D.P., and raising living standards. As recently as September, at a U.N. climate summit, China refused to say when its production of CO2 would peak. But here was President Xi Jinping pledging that, by 2030, his country’s carbon emissions would max out, and energy from renewable sources would meet twenty per cent of its total energy needs. In a sense, there’s less to the deal than meets the eye. It’s non-binding, and, as the White House statement about it makes clear, the dates aren’t necessarily firm. China has said that “it intends” to make sure its emissions will peak “around 2030,” and that the share of the energy it consumes that comes from non-fossil fuels rises to “around 20%.” The United States has said it “intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025.” Clearly, there’s wiggle room on both sides. However, the fact that the world’s two largest polluters have agreed to work together on this issue, rather than sniping at each other from afar, is important. A major problem with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was that it exempted China, India, and most other developing countries from imposing restrictions on emissions. (That failure prompted the Bush Administration, in 2001, to say that the United States was dropping out and wouldn’t honor the protocol.) Now, for the first time, there appears to be the possibility of a larger international agreement, a successor to the Kyoto treaty, that would encompass developed and developing nations. If such an arrangement could be constructed, it would mark the first serious effort to tackle climate change on a global, rather than a regional, basis. In short, China’s change of heart is a big deal. But what lies behind it? And it is for real? The first point to note is that the shift isn’t as sudden as it appears. Although the government in Beijing has been unwilling to make international commitments on global warming, it long ago recognized the existence of the problem, and took some internal measures to alleviate it. In 2007, during the premiership of Hu Jintao, the Chinese authorities formulated a National Climate Change Program, which was intended to “build a resource conservative and environmentally friendly society.” At a time when China was building coal-fired power plants across the country to meet the soaring demand for electricity from a rapidly growing economy, it was easy to scoff at such a declaration. (Between 2005 and 2009 alone, China added coal capacity equivalent to all the coal-fired plants in the United States.) But the Chinese, in their own way, were serious. In addition to putting up new coal-fired plants, they invested heavily in nuclear, wind, hydroelectric, and solar power. The government set a target of ten per cent for the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources in 2010. China didn’t hit this figure on schedule, but, four years later, it has just about reached the target—meaning it supplies about the same share of its energy needs with renewables as the United States does (based on figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration). And, even before this week’s announcement, the Chinese government had already raised its goal for renewables, to fifteen per cent of its total energy needs by 2020. To help reach this target, the country is still investing heavily in alternative-energy projects. Indeed, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, China now accounts for about thirty per cent of worldwide investment in renewables—more than Europe or the United States. China’s new projects include solar-energy plants and offshore wind farms. Last year alone, according to Bloomberg, the country installed twelve gigawatts' worth of solar panels, which is about equal to all the solar capacity in the United States. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Re-creating the Syria of His Memories, Through Miniatures At the same time, of course, China has been building more coal plants. Indeed, coal still accounts for more than seventy per cent of the country’s energy consumption. This has come at a high price: horrible smog in many of China’s cities, including Beijing. When the Beijing Marathon was run recently, the city’s air-quality index, which measures how much pollution there is in the air, was more than sixteen times the level that the World Health Organization deems healthy. The high levels of pollution are an embarrassment to the Communist regime. In advance of this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the government closed down many coal plants in the neighboring Hebei province, leading some Beijing inhabitants to dub the resulting clear skies “APEC blue.” But the country’s image is far from the only issue. Among the Chinese population, asthma has turned into a chronic problem; in 2012 alone, according to one study, nearly seven hundred thousand people died from smog-related causes. Responding to growing public concerns, the government earlier this year vowed to take action. Li Keqiang, China’s second-ranking official, told the country’s parliament, “We will resolutely declare war against pollution, as we declared war against poverty.” In the past, China has always regarded serious efforts to tackle environmental concerns as too costly, in terms of foregone jobs and G.D.P. But the country’s thinking is starting to change. And that, ultimately, is what offers the most hope for a greener China, even as, for the next decade or more, it will continue to build more coal plants and emit more CO2. It’s not that the Chinese have downgraded economic growth: far from it. The country’s current Five-Year Plan envisages the continuation of its current rate of G.D.P. growth, which is about seven per cent. Its next Five-Year Plan, which it will adopt in early 2016, will doubtless feature a similar target. What’s different is where that growth will come from. As the Chinese economy starts the shift from manufacturing to services that all developing economies make sooner or later, more of the country’s growth will come from industries that don’t use energy so intensively, such as health care and entertainment. And that, rather than any diktat or international agreement, will be what enables China, eventually, to combine rapid economic development with lower carbon emissions. Or, at least, that is how some of the smartest people in the Chinese government see things evolving. “Healthcare, education, information technology, sports, and the cultural and entertainment industries will all enjoy great potential for rapid growth,” Ma Jun, the chief economist at China’s central bank, wrote in a recent article. “Real estate, the automobile industry and the construction materials’ industry, on the other hand, will likely face a prolonged period of profit deceleration and weaker investment in the medium and longer run. The proportion of heavy, polluting industries in economy will decrease.” According to this vision, policy developments will also play a role. Cleaner energies will be substituted for coal (or, possibly, practical carbon-sequestration technologies will emerge), there will be more investment in public transportation, and, in 2016, according to officials, China will introduce a national cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. (A number of cities are currently experimenting with local schemes.) Will it all be enough to prevent China from boiling the planet, a possibility raised by Jonathan Watts in his 2010 book, “When a Billion Chinese Jump”? Even after this week’s developments, there’s not yet a definitive answer to this question. But things are looking a bit brighter, and not just for residents of Beijing.

Will California Again Lead the Way on Prison Reform?,8817,"For much of the twentieth century, if you committed a serious crime in California, a judge would sentence you to an ambiguous-sounding prison term—say, five years to life. While you were serving your sentence, a parole board would review your record and decide how long the rest of the sentence should be, based on factors such as your behavior and your participation in prison rehabilitation programs. The idea was to take the specifics of the crime into account in the original sentencing, and then to reward those who seemed to be taking steps toward genuine rehabilitation. But in the sixties and seventies, liberal lawmakers, influenced by the civil-rights movement, started to observe that the racial and class biases of parole-board members were influencing their decisions. At the same time, conservatives, troubled by rising crime, began to argue that parole boards had too much power, which was leading to lenient sentencing decisions. In 1976, under pressure from both sides, Governor Jerry Brown, a moderate Democrat, signed a law mandating “determinate” sentences in California: from then on, judges would choose from a set of firm sentences for each crime, stripping power from fickle and possibly racist parole boards. “It is the most far-reaching criminal-justice reform in the last fifty years,” Brown said at the time. The reform was far-reaching, but perhaps not in the way that Brown had expected. California’s prison population began to balloon—the determinate sentences, set by the state legislature, turned out to be longer, on average, than the indeterminate ones. This trend was compounded by new federal laws that were passed in the aftermath of California’s (and of one passed by New York earlier in the seventies, which enacted strict penalties for selling drugs). Among them was the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, signed by Bill Clinton, which included the notorious “Three Strikes, You’re Out” provision, for dealing with repeat offenders. Many states enacted similar tough-on-crime measures. In 1978, state prisons held a hundred and twenty-three people for each hundred thousand U.S. residents; by 2007, that figure had risen to four hundred and sixty-one. The effects were disproportionately felt by low-income men of color. As Adam Gopnik wrote, in a 2012 article about the prison boom, “For most privileged, professional people, the experience of confinement is a mere brush, encountered after a kid’s arrest, say. For a great many poor people in America, particularly poor black men, prison is a destination that braids through an ordinary life, much as high school and college do for rich white ones.” A great deal has happened over the past several decades to precipitate a change in public sentiment about prisons. In the late seventies, voters and politicians on the left were preoccupied with civil rights, and, on the right, with crime. But over the following decades, liberals became more focussed on the systems that perpetuate economic inequality—subpar schools, low access to healthcare, and, yes, high incarceration rates—and conservatives began to concentrate on government spending. When the recession of the late aughts devastated state budgets, liberal and conservative concerns converged: this time, liberals sought to lower imprisonment rates in service of social justice and in order to free up resources for education and health programs, while conservatives sought the same in service of reduced spending. A prison exodus began not only in California and other blue states but also in conservative states such as Texas. By the time Brown was inaugurated as governor for a third time, in 2011, California’s prison population had already fallen, but it was largely because his Republican predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, had transferred thousands of prisoners to out-of-state facilities. A few months after Brown became governor, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California’s prisons were so overcrowded as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy called the situation “exceptional,” describing gymnasiums that housed hundreds of inmates and toilets shared by upward of fifty people. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? Later that year, the state began implementing a law, signed by Brown, mandating that people convicted of certain low-level crimes be punished at the county level—by being put in county jails or on probation overseen by county officers, instead of into the state system of prison and parole. The plan was known as “realignment.” With that move, Brown came to the fore of efforts to reverse prison growth, decades after he’d played a key role in its expansion. It wasn’t a sudden shift, however. In 2003, while Brown was serving as mayor of Oakland, he had publicly repented about the determinate-sentencing decision, calling it an “abysmal failure” and describing California’s prisons as “postgraduate schools of crime.” Brown’s policies are seen as largely responsible for lowering the total number of inmates in the state’s prisons by about a fifth since 2011, to about a hundred and seventeen thousand people. Still, the law hasn’t accomplished as much as Brown and other advocates had hoped it would. California prisons still house far more people than they were built for. In 2011, the Supreme Court mandated that the state heed a call from a three-judge court to bring its prison population down to close to a hundred and ten thousand people; the Supreme Court gave the state until 2013. But, now, the panel has been forced to give California an extension, to 2016, to get there. On Tuesday, California voters went further still, passing a ballot measure, Proposition 47, that will turn certain felonies that often result in state-prison sentences into misdemeanors, which are typically punished by lower-level sentences, such as time in county jail. The measure passed by a wide margin, with fifty-eight per cent in favor and forty-two per cent opposed. The development has been widely celebrated in criminal-justice circles and seen as a continuation of Californians’ repudiation of the tough-on-crime age. “There’s a shift in the national consciousness,” Allen Hopper, the criminal-justice and drug-policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of California, told the Sacramento Bee. “I think that ‘smart on crime’ sort of captures the mood of the nation now.” Though this may be true, the outcome of Prop. 47’s passage is uncertain. The measure’s opponents had argued, for example, that the muted deterrence effect would lead to more crimes. This could well happen. But Hayley Munguia, of FiveThirtyEight.com, looked on Thursday at similar laws that have recently passed in other states—Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas—and found that, in three of the four states, crime rates had decreased afterward. Since California started enacting reforms, in 2011, its rate of violent crimes has fallen, too, from four hundred and thirty-nine per hundred thousand residents, in 2010, to under four hundred, in 2013. (This continued a general decline since 1992, when the rate hit a record of eleven hundred.) Also uncertain is whether Prop. 47 will actually keep people out of prison, let alone lower California’s prison population enough to the level mandated by the judges. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, which advises the state legislature, estimated before the measure’s passage that it would reduce the state prison population by “several thousand” inmates, but it didn’t offer a more specific figure. None of this is to suggest that California is making poor decisions—only that the outcomes won’t be known for quite a while. That’s to be expected with big legislative changes meant to reverse decades’ worth of public policy. Discussing the realignment law, Brown recently made a remark that was eerily similar to his 1976 comment about determinate sentencing, calling the new law “the biggest change, probably, in our prison system in the last forty years.” Both times, Brown was prescient in recognizing that an important transformation was afoot; the hope is that this time it’s for the better.

Inside the Biggest-Ever Hedge-Fund Scandal,76572,"As Dr. Sid Gilman approached the stage, the hotel ballroom quieted with anticipation. It was July 29, 2008, and a thousand people had gathered in Chicago for the International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease. For decades, scientists had tried, and failed, to devise a cure for Alzheimer’s. But in recent years two pharmaceutical companies, Elan and Wyeth, had worked together on an experimental drug called bapineuzumab, which had shown promise in halting the cognitive decay caused by the disease. Tests on mice had proved successful, and in an initial clinical trial a small number of human patients appeared to improve. A second phase of trials, involving two hundred and forty patients, was near completion. Gilman had chaired the safety-monitoring committee for the trials. Now he was going to announce the results of the second phase. Alzheimer’s affects roughly five million Americans, and it is projected that as the population ages the number of new cases will increase dramatically. This looming epidemic has added urgency to the scientific search for a cure. It has also come to the attention of investors, because there would be huge demand for a drug that diminishes the effects of Alzheimer’s. As Elan and Wyeth spent hundreds of millions of dollars concocting and testing bapineuzumab, and issued hints about the possibility of a medical breakthrough, investors wondered whether bapi, as it became known, might be “the next Lipitor.” Several months before the Chicago conference, Barron’s published a cover story speculating that bapi could become “the biggest drug of all time.” One prominent investor was known to have made a very large bet on bapi. In the two years leading up to the conference, the billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen had accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Elan and Wyeth stock. Cohen had started his own hedge fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors, with twenty-five million dollars in 1992 and developed it into a fourteen-billion-dollar empire that employed a thousand people. The fund charged wealthy clients conspicuously high commissions and fees to manage their money, but even after the exorbitant surcharge investors saw average annual returns of more than thirty per cent. S.A.C. made investments in several thousand stocks, but by the summer of 2008 the firm’s single largest position was in Wyeth, and its fifth-largest was in Elan. All told, Cohen had gambled about three-quarters of a billion dollars on bapi. He was famous for making trades based on “catalysts”—events that might help or hurt the value of a given stock. Sid Gilman’s presentation of the clinical data in Chicago was a classic catalyst: if the results were promising, the stocks would soar, and Cohen would make a fortune. Gilman had not wanted to make the presentation. Seventy-six years old and suffering from lymphoma, he had recently undergone chemotherapy, which left him completely bald—like the “evil scientist in an Indiana Jones movie,” he joked. But Elan executives urged Gilman to participate. He was a revered figure in medical circles, the longtime chair of neurology at the University of Michigan’s medical school. In Ann Arbor, a lecture series and a wing of the university hospital were named for him. His C.V. was forty-three pages long. As a steward for the fledgling drug, he conveyed a reassuring authority. But soon after Gilman began his thirteen-minute presentation, accompanied by PowerPoint slides, it became clear that the bapi trials had not been an unqualified success. Bapi appeared to reduce symptoms in some patients but not in others. Gilman was optimistic about the results; the data “seemed so promising,” he told a colleague. But the investment community was less sanguine about the drug’s commercial prospects. One market analyst, summarizing the general feeling, pronounced the results “a disaster.” The Chicago conference was indeed a catalyst, but not the type that investors had expected. It appeared that Cohen had made an epic misjudgment. When the market closed the following day, Elan’s stock had plummeted forty per cent. Wyeth’s had dropped nearly twelve per cent. By the time Gilman made his presentation, however, S.A.C. Capital no longer owned any stock in Elan or Wyeth. In the eight days preceding the conference, Cohen had liquidated his seven-hundred-million-dollar position in the two companies, and had then proceeded to “short” the stocks—to bet against them—making a two-hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar profit. In a week, Cohen had reversed his position on bapi by nearly a billion dollars. Gilman and Cohen had never met. The details of the clinical trials had been a closely guarded secret, yet S.A.C. had brilliantly anticipated them. Cohen has suggested that his decisions about stocks are governed largely by “gut.” He is said to have an uncanny ability to watch the numbers on a stock ticker and intuit where they will go. In the assessment of Chandler Bocklage, one of his longtime deputies, Cohen is “the greatest trader of all time.” But federal authorities had a different explanation for S.A.C.’s masterstroke. More than three years after the Chicago conference, in December, 2012, prosecutors in New York indicted a young man named Mathew Martoma, who had worked as a portfolio manager for Cohen. They accused him of using confidential information about bapi to engineer the most lucrative insider-trading scheme in history. According to the indictment, Martoma had been receiving secret details about the progress of the clinical trials for nearly two years and, ultimately, obtained an early warning about the disappointing results of the second phase. His source for this intelligence was Sid Gilman. In 1977, after completing medical school at U.C.L.A. and teaching at Harvard and Columbia, Gilman was recruited to run the neurology department at the University of Michigan. He moved to Ann Arbor with his first wife, Linda, and their two sons. Gilman’s marriage unravelled in the early eighties, and the older son, Jeff, developed psychological problems. Jeff committed suicide in 1983, overdosing on pills in a hotel room near campus. Gilman had experienced tragedy before: his father had walked out on the family when he was a boy, and his mother later committed suicide. After Jeff’s death, Gilman seems to have dealt with his despair by throwing himself into his job. “The man worked himself to distraction,” one of his many protégés, Anne Young, who went on to become the chief of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, told me. In 1984, Gilman married a psychoanalyst named Carol Barbour, but they never had children, and though his surviving son, Todd, attended the University of Michigan, they eventually became estranged, leaving him with no ties to his former family. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Over the years, however, Gilman became a father figure to dozens of medical residents and junior colleagues. “Helping younger people along—that was a constant,” Kurt Fischbeck, a former colleague of Gilman’s who now works at the National Institutes of Health, told me. Gilman was “incredibly supportive” of younger faculty, Young said. “He would go over grants with us, really putting an effort into it, which is something chairs rarely do.” One day in 2002, Gilman was contacted by a doctor named Edward Shin, who worked for a new company called the Gerson Lehrman Group. G.L.G., as it was known, served as a matchmaker between investors and experts in specialized industries who might answer their questions. “It was kind of ridiculous that the hedge-fund business got so much information by asking for favors . . . when it would certainly pay,” the company’s chief executive, Mark Gerson, told the Times. Shin proposed that Gilman join G.L.G.’s network of experts, becoming a consultant who could earn as much as a thousand dollars an hour. Gilman was hardly alone in saying yes to such a proposal. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that, by 2005, nearly ten per cent of the physicians in the U.S. had established relationships with the investment industry—a seventy-five-fold increase since 1996. The article noted that the speed and the extent of this intertwining were “likely unprecedented in the history of professional-industrial relationships.” Gilman read the jama article, but disagreed that such arrangements were objectionable. In an e-mail to Shin, he explained that investors often offered him a fresh perspective on his own research: “Although remuneration provides an incentive, the most attractive feature to this relationship (at least for me) is the exchange.” Gilman’s university salary was about three hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year, a sum that went a long way in Ann Arbor. As he took on more paid consultations, he began supplementing his income by hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Acquaintances did not notice any abrupt change in his life style: Gilman wore elegant clothes, but otherwise he and his wife appeared to live relatively modestly. “He was not a flashy guy who revelled in expensive toys,” Tim Greenamyre, a former student, who now runs the Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, told me. Gilman counselled Greenamyre and other colleagues to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest in their professional dealings, and he made a point of telling people that he never invested in pharmaceutical stocks. The consulting, he later maintained, was simply “a diversion.” In the summer of 2006, Gilman received a call from Mathew Martoma, who explained that he had recently joined S.A.C. and was focussing on health-care stocks. They spoke about Alzheimer’s remedies, and specifically about bapineuzumab. Although Martoma had no medical background, he was attuned to the scientific intricacies at play. His mother and his wife, Rosemary, were physicians, and he had a long-standing interest in Alzheimer’s, dating back to his childhood, in Florida, when he volunteered as a candy striper at a local hospital. He and Gilman talked for more than two hours. Afterward, Martoma asked G.L.G. to schedule another consultation. S.A.C. was a notoriously intense place to work. Its headquarters, on a spit of land in Stamford, Connecticut, overlooking the Long Island Sound, are decorated with art from Cohen’s personal collection, including “Self,” a refrigerated glass cube, by Marc Quinn, containing a disembodied head sculpted from the artist’s frozen blood. It was nearly as frigid on the twenty-thousand-square-foot trading floor, which Cohen kept fiercely air-conditioned—employees were issued fleece jackets with the S.A.C. monogram, for keeping warm. The atmosphere was hushed, with telephones programmed to blink rather than ring, but a curious soundtrack could be heard throughout the building. As Cohen sat at his sprawling desk, before a flotilla of flat-screen monitors, and barked orders for his personal trades, a camera—the “Steve cam”—was trained on him, broadcasting his staccato patter to his subordinates. Cohen is not a physically imposing man: he is pale and gnomish, with a crooked, gap-toothed smile. But on the Steve cam he was Oz. When S.A.C. first approached Martoma about a job, he was ambivalent. He was living in Boston, working happily at a small hedge fund called Sirios Capital Management. He knew that careers at S.A.C. followed a starkly binary narrative. Portfolio managers were given a pot of money. If their investments were consistently profitable, they became very rich very quickly. If their investments lost money, they were out of a job. Contracts at S.A.C. contained a “down and out” clause, so it was prosper or die. Cohen likened his traders to élite athletes; for many years, he paid a psychiatrist who had worked with Olympic competitors to spend several days a week at S.A.C., counselling employees about mastering their fears. He hired high achievers who were accustomed to gruelling pressure. Martoma had studied bioethics at Duke, graduating summa cum laude. After a year working at the National Institutes of Health, where he co-authored a paper, “Alzheimer Testing at Silver Years,” in the Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, he was admitted to Harvard Law School. He departed a year later, during the dot-com boom, and launched a startup. Next, he obtained an M.B.A. from Stanford. S.A.C. was another brand-name institution, a strong allure for someone like Martoma. After visiting the office in Stamford and spending a day shadowing Cohen on the trading floor, he accepted the job. S.A.C. relied on portfolio managers to devise novel investment ideas. In a marketplace crowded with hedge funds, it had become “hard to find ideas that aren’t picked over,” Cohen complained to the Wall Street Journal, in 2006. In the business, a subtle but crucial informational advantage was called “edge.” Richard Holwell, a former federal judge in New York who presided over high-profile securities-fraud cases, told me that, in order to evaluate a technology stock, hedge funds sent “people to China to sit in front of a factory and see whether it was doing one shift or two.” He added, “An edge is the goal of every portfolio manager.” When Cohen was asked about edge during a deposition in 2011, he said, “I hate that word.” But S.A.C.’s promotional materials boasted about the firm’s “edge,” and Cohen provided his employees with every research tool that might offer a boost over the competition. The eat-what-you-kill incentive structure at S.A.C. put a damper on collegiality. Employees with edge had no motivation to share it with one another. But every good idea was shared with Cohen. Each Sunday, portfolio managers sent a memo to an e-mail address known as “Steve ideas,” in which they spelled out their most promising leads, weighted by their level of conviction. Martoma had always been avid about research, and he was impressed by S.A.C.’s resources. At his disposal was a boutique firm full of former C.I.A. officers who could monitor the public statements of corporate executives and evaluate whether they were hiding something; S.A.C. also had a “buffet plan” with the Gerson Lehrman Group, giving Martoma unrestricted access to thousands of experts. From his first days in Stamford, he was interested in the investment potential of bapi. He contacted G.L.G. with a list of twenty-two doctors he hoped to consult, all of whom were involved in the clinical trials of the drug. Most declined, citing a conflict of interest; clinical investigators had to sign confidentiality agreements that constrained their ability to talk about the progress of the trials. But Sid Gilman accepted, noting, in his response to G.L.G., that he would “share only information that is openly available.” On the Sunday after the initial conversation with Gilman, Martoma sent an e-mail to Steven Cohen, suggesting that S.A.C. buy 4.5 million shares of Elan stock, and noting that his conviction level was “High.” Martoma was born Ajai Mathew Thomas in 1974, and grew up in Merritt Island, Florida. His parents had emigrated from Kerala, in southern India, during the sixties. They were Christian; the name Martoma, which the family adopted around the turn of the millennium, is a tribute to the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, an Orthodox denomination that is based in Kerala. Mathew’s father, Bobby, was a stern man with a sharp nose and a clipped mustache. He owned a dry-cleaning business, and placed enormous pressure on his son to succeed. Mathew obliged, excelling in school and starting a lawnmowing operation in which he outsourced the actual mowing to other kids. The oldest of three brothers, he seems to have taken naturally to the role of family standard-bearer. Childhood photographs show him grinning, with his hair neatly parted, in a tiny three-piece suit. When Martoma’s father first came to America, he was admitted to M.I.T., but he could not afford to attend. He retained a fascination with Cambridge, however, and prayed daily that his oldest son would go to Harvard. Martoma graduated from high school as co-valedictorian, but he ended up going to Duke. Shortly after Mathew’s eighteenth birthday, Bobby presented him with a plaque inscribed with the words “Son Who Shattered His Father’s Dream.” During college, Martoma volunteered in the Alzheimer’s wing of the Duke Medical Center, and developed an interest in medical ethics. Bruce Payne, who taught Martoma in a course on ethics and policymaking, remembers him as “creased and pressed—very pre-professional.” Payne wrote a recommendation letter for Martoma’s application to business school at Stanford, praising his subtle readings of Sissela Bok’s “Lying” and Albert Camus’s “The Plague.” Martoma was unusually adept at cultivating mentors. “He was ambitious—he wanted to make something of his life,” Ronald Green, who supervised Martoma during his year at N.I.H. and is now a professor at Dartmouth, told me. “To some extent, I felt like Mathew was an adopted son.” At Stanford, Martoma was introduced to a young pediatrician from New Zealand named Rosemary Kurian. Strikingly beautiful, she was studying for her medical boards so that she could practice in the United States. She had grown up in a sheltered family and had never dated before. But she felt an immediate bond with Mathew: her parents were also from Kerala, and she, too, felt both very Indian and very Western. “I was just enamored with how lovely he was,” she told me recently. “And he seemed to be very respectful of my parents.” Her mother and father endorsed the relationship, and in 2003 Mathew and Rosemary were married, in an Eastern Orthodox cathedral in Coral Gables, Florida. By the time they moved to Connecticut, they had one child and Rosemary was pregnant with a second. She stopped working, but she was very involved in advancing Mathew’s career. “Mathew didn’t just do that job by himself,” she told me, with a smile. He worked perpetually. “It was heads-down, tails-up, twenty-four-seven kind of work.” Martoma rose at 4 a.m. to keep up with the European health-care markets, then worked until the market in New York closed. After spending a few hours with the children, he put in another shift, sitting in bed with his laptop while Rosemary fell asleep beside him. He had numerous investment prospects, but bapi was the most promising, and it became an obsession. “As a portfolio manager, you live by your ups and downs,” Rosemary said. “These stocks, they’re your babies, and you’re following them and you’re nurturing them.” The fixation became a running joke, and her conversations with him were often punctuated by the word “Bapsolutely!” Rosemary never met Sid Gilman, but throughout the fall of 2006 Martoma arranged frequent consultations with him about bapi. Much later, in court, Gilman recounted this phase in their relationship as a kind of intellectual seduction. They spoke for hours about the trials for various Alzheimer’s drugs. “Every time I told him about a clinical trial, he seemed to know a good deal about it,” Gilman testified. “The more I told him about each of the trials, the more he wanted to know.” Gilman found himself wishing that his students in Ann Arbor were as bright and curious as Martoma. That October, Gilman had plans to visit New York on other business, and Martoma arranged to meet with him at S.A.C.’s offices in Manhattan. In an e-mail to G.L.G., Martoma specified that he wanted the meeting “to be with just me and dr. gilman alone.” The appointment was at lunchtime, and when Gilman was shown into the room he was pleased by a small courtesy—an array of sandwiches. Martoma walked in, broad-shouldered and genial, with close-cropped black hair and long eyelashes that gave his face a feline aspect. He was “very, very friendly,” Gilman recalled. Martoma complimented him on “the previous consultations we had.” According to G.L.G.’s records, Gilman and Martoma had forty-two formal consultations over two years. Gilman consulted with many other investors during this time, and Martoma spoke to many other doctors, but neither spoke to anyone else with nearly the same frequency that they did with each other. It seemed to Gilman that Martoma shared his passion for Alzheimer’s research, and regarded the efforts to create an effective drug as much more than a matter of financial interest. In e-mails, Martoma had a tendency to slip into the first-person plural, using “we” when discussing how medical professionals treated people with the disease. Gilman also got the impression that Martoma wanted to be friends. Martoma proposed that they have coffee after meetings of the American Academy of Neurology. He talked to Gilman about his family’s emigration from India, and about how he and Rosemary had had their children in rapid succession. In e-mails, he sent his best wishes to Gilman’s “better half.” Gilman called Martoma “Mat,” but, even when they were speaking almost daily, Martoma always addressed him as “Dr. Gilman.” Once, when Gilman was travelling in Istanbul, he forgot about a scheduled consultation. Unable to reach him, Martoma had his assistant make multiple calls to try to track the doctor down. Eventually, a hotel employee discovered Gilman by himself, reading, and alerted him to the calls. “I was in a foreign country, and he couldn’t find me,” Gilman testified. “It was touching.” Later, Gilman had trouble pinpointing just when his relationship with Martoma crossed into illegality. But he recalled a moment when Martoma asked, repeatedly, about the side effects that one might expect to see from bapi. “I didn’t quite recognize it for what I think it was, which was an attempt to find confidential information,” Gilman said. Initially, he offered theoretical responses, but Martoma “persisted in wanting to know what really happened,” and finally the answers “slipped out.” Gilman told him how many patients and how many placebo cases had experienced each adverse effect. While he was talking, Martoma periodically asked him to slow down, so that he could transcribe the numbers. In 1942, lawyers in the Boston office of the Securities and Exchange Commission learned that the president of a local company was issuing a pessimistic forecast to shareholders and then offering to purchase their shares. What the president knew, and the shareholders didn’t, was that earnings were on track to quadruple in the coming year. He had edge, which allowed him to dupe his own shareholders into selling him the stock at far below its real value. Later that year, the S.E.C. established Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, making insider trading a federal crime. At the time, one of the commissioners remarked, “Well, we’re against fraud, aren’t we?” In the ensuing decades, however, enforcement of this prohibition has been inconsistent. Some academics have suggested that insider trading is effectively a victimless crime, and should not be aggressively prosecuted. At least privately, many in the financial industry agree. But in 2009, when Preet Bharara took over as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, with jurisdiction over Wall Street, he made it a priority to curb this type of securities fraud. The problem had become “rampant” in the hedge-fund industry, Bharara told me, in part because of a prevailing sense that the rewards for insider trading were potentially astronomical—and the penalty if you were caught was relatively slight. “These are people who are in the business of assessing risk, because that’s what trading is, and they were thinking, The greatest consequence I will face is paying some fines,” Bharara said. His strategy for changing their behavior was to throw a new variable into the cost-benefit equation: prison. Agents from the F.B.I. and the S.E.C. began asking investment professionals to identify the biggest malefactors. Peter Grupe, who supervised the investigations at the F.B.I., told me that all the informants were “pointing in the same direction—Stamford, Connecticut.” Rumors about insider trading had circulated around Steven Cohen since his first years in the business. As a young trader at a small investment bank called Gruntal & Company, he was deposed by the S.E.C. in 1986 about suspicious trades surrounding General Electric’s acquisition of R.C.A. Cohen asserted the Fifth Amendment and was never indicted, but, during the nineties, as his fund became extraordinarily profitable, observers and rivals speculated that he must be doing something untoward. Like Bernard Madoff’s investment firm, S.A.C. enjoyed a level of success that could seem suspicious on its face. “A lot of people assumed for years that S.A.C. was cheating, because it was generating returns that didn’t seem sustainable if you were playing the same game as everyone else,” the manager of another hedge fund told me. When Cohen was growing up, as one of eight children in a middle-class family in Great Neck, New York, his father, who owned a garment factory in the Bronx, brought home the New York Post every evening. Cohen read the sports pages, but noticed that there were also “these other pages filled with numbers.” In an interview for Jack Schwager’s book “Stock Market Wizards” (2001), he recalled: I was fascinated when I found out that these numbers were prices, which were changing every day. I started hanging out at the local brokerage office, watching the stock quotes. When I was in high school, I took a summer job at a clothing store, located just down the block from a brokerage office, so that I could run in and watch the tape during my lunch hour. In those days, the tape was so slow that you could follow it. You could see volume coming into a stock and get the sense that it was going higher. You can’t do that nowadays; the tape is far too fast. But everything I do today has its roots in those early tape-reading experiences. Cohen was never a “value investor”—someone who makes sustained commitments to companies that he believes in. He moved in and out of stocks quickly, making big bets on short-term fluctuations in their price. “Steve has no emotion in this stuff,” one of his portfolio managers said in a deposition last year. “Stocks mean nothing to him. They’re just ideas, they’re not even his ideas. . . . He’s a trader, he’s not an analyst. And he trades constantly. That’s what he loves to do.” The business model at S.A.C., though, was based not on instinct but on the aggressive accumulation of information and analysis. In fact, as federal agents pursued multiple overlapping investigations into insider trading at hedge funds, it began to appear that the culture at S.A.C. not only tolerated but encouraged the use of inside information. In the recent trial of Michael Steinberg, one of Cohen’s longtime portfolio managers, a witness named Jon Horvath, who had worked as a research analyst at S.A.C., recalled Steinberg telling him, “I can day-trade these stocks and make money by myself. I don’t need your help to do that. What I need you to do is go out and get me edgy, proprietary information.” Horvath took this to mean illegal, nonpublic information—and he felt that he’d be fired if he didn’t get it. When Cohen interviewed job applicants, he liked to say, “Tell me some of the riskiest things you’ve ever done in your life.” In 2009, a portfolio manager named Richard Lee applied for a job. Cohen received a warning from another hedge fund that Lee had been part of an “insider-trading group.” S.A.C.’s legal department warned that hiring Lee would be a mistake, but Cohen overruled them. (Lee subsequently pleaded guilty to insider trading.) White-collar criminals tend to make soft targets for law enforcement. “The success rate at getting people to coöperate was phenomenal,” Peter Grupe told me. Most of the suspects in insider-trading investigations have never been arrested, nor have they contemplated the prospect of serious jail time. When Michael Steinberg was waiting for the jury in his trial to pronounce a verdict, he fainted in open court. So the authorities approached hedge-fund employees, one by one, confronting them with evidence of their crimes and asking them what else they knew. Because the suspects weren’t anticipating being under surveillance, the F.B.I. could tail them for weeks. Then one day, as a suspect headed into a coffee shop and prepared to place his usual order, an agent would sidle up and place the order for him. The tactics echoed the approach the F.B.I. had used to dismantle the New York Mob. The plan was to arrest low-level soldiers, threaten them with lengthy jail terms, and then flip them, gathering information that could lead to arrests farther up the criminal hierarchy. Over time, agents produced an organizational chart with names and faces, just as they had with La Cosa Nostra. At the top of the pyramid was Steven Cohen. In 2010, F.B.I. agents approached a young man named Noah Freeman, who had been fired by S.A.C. and was teaching at a girls’ school in Boston. Freeman became a key witness. Asked in court how often he had attempted to obtain illegal edge, he replied, “Multiple times per day.” According to an F.B.I. memo, “Freeman and others at S.A.C. Capital understood that providing Cohen with your best trading ideas involved providing Cohen with inside information.” When Martoma first came to S.A.C., his due-diligence report had noted his “industry contacts” and his personal “network of doctors in the field.” Through the fall of 2007, he acquired more and more Elan and Wyeth stock, and Cohen followed his lead, supplementing the money that Martoma was investing from his own portfolio with funds from Cohen’s personal account. That October, Martoma e-mailed Cohen that bapi was on track to start Phase III trials soon, and that they would make up “the most comprehensive alzheimer’s program to date.” S.A.C. had a proprietary computer system, known as Panorama, which allowed employees to monitor the company’s holdings in real time. Employees checked Panorama incessantly, and many noticed the scale of the bet that Martoma, a relatively junior portfolio manager, was making, and the fact that Cohen was backing him. Because of the open plan in the Stamford office and the simulcast from Cohen’s desk, people could watch as Martoma approached the boss and murmured recommendations. A portfolio manager named David Munno, who had a Ph.D. in neuroscience, was skeptical about bapi’s prospects. He didn’t like Martoma, and didn’t understand the source of his conviction. At one point, he wrote to Cohen, wondering whether Martoma actually knew something about the bapi trial or simply had “a very strong feeling.” “Tough one,” Cohen replied. “I think Mat is the closest to it.” It’s impossible to know exactly how Martoma buttressed Cohen’s confidence in bapi. Portfolio managers at S.A.C. often wrote detailed explanations to support trading recommendations, but, when it came to bapi, Cohen and Martoma preferred to talk. Martoma’s e-mails to his boss often consisted of a single line: “Do you have a sec to talk?” “Do you have a moment to speak when you get in?” Whenever Munno pressed Cohen on how Martoma knew so much about bapi, Cohen responded cryptically. “Mat thinks this will be a huge drug,” he wrote to Munno at one point. On another occasion, he explained simply that “Mat has a lot of good relationships in this area.” A second portfolio manager, Benjamin Slate, shared Munno’s concerns, suggesting, in one e-mail, that it was “totally unacceptable to bet ½ billion dollars on alzheimers without a real discussion.” In a message to Slate a month before the Chicago conference, Munno complained that Martoma was telling people he had “black edge.” In subsequent legal filings, S.A.C. has claimed that Munno and Slate coined the term “black edge,” as “humorous commentary.” But, according to subsequent filings by the Department of Justice, “black edge” was “a phrase meaning inside information.” Initially, Gilman may have “slipped” when he divulged secret details to Martoma, but as their friendship continued the malfeasance became more systematic. Whenever Gilman learned about a meeting of the safety-monitoring committee, Martoma scheduled a consultation immediately afterward, so that Gilman could share whatever new information he had obtained. Apart from consultation fees, Gilman did not receive any additional remuneration from Martoma, yet he slid into ethical breaches with an ease verging on enthusiasm. At one point, Gilman proposed outright deception, suggesting to Martoma that they supply the Gerson Lehrman Group with fraudulent pretexts for meetings, in order to deflect suspicion. On June 25, 2008, Gilman sent an e-mail to Martoma with the subject line “Some news.” Elan and Wyeth had appointed him to present the results of the Phase II clinical trials at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease, in July. Martoma scheduled a consultation, informing G.L.G., inaccurately, that he and Gilman would be discussing therapies for multiple sclerosis. Up to this point, Gilman had been given access to the safety results of the trials, but he had been “blinded” to the all-important efficacy results. Now, in order to present the findings, Gilman would be “unblinded.” Two weeks later, Elan arranged for a private jet to fly him from Detroit to San Francisco, where the company had offices. He spent two days with company executives, crafting his conference presentation. When he returned to Michigan, an Elan executive sent Gilman an e-mail titled “Confidential, Do Not Distribute.” It contained an updated version of the twenty-four-slide PowerPoint presentation that would accompany his remarks. After downloading the slide show, Gilman received a call from Martoma. They spoke for an hour and forty-five minutes, during which, Gilman later admitted, he relayed the contents of the presentation. But the material was complicated—too complicated, perhaps, to convey over the phone. Martoma announced that he happened to be flying to Michigan that weekend; a relative had died, but he had been too busy to attend the funeral, so he was going belatedly to pay his respects. Could he swing by? “Sure, you can drop in,” Gilman replied. Two days later, Martoma flew from J.F.K. to Detroit, took a taxi to Ann Arbor, and met with Gilman for an hour in his office on campus. He flew back to New York that evening, without having visited his family. Rosemary picked him up at the airport. The next morning, Sunday, Martoma e-mailed Cohen, “Is there a good time to catch up with you this morning? It’s important.” Cohen e-mailed Martoma a phone number, and at 9:45 a.m. Martoma called him at home. According to phone records introduced in court, they spoke for twenty minutes. When the market opened on Monday, Cohen and Martoma instructed Phil Villhauer, Cohen’s head trader at S.A.C., to begin quietly selling Elan and Wyeth shares. Villhauer unloaded them using “dark pools”—an anonymous electronic exchange for stocks—and other techniques that made the trades difficult to detect. Over the next several days, S.A.C. sold off its entire position in Elan and Wyeth so discreetly that only a few people at the firm were aware it was happening. On July 21st, Villhauer wrote to Martoma, “No one knows except me you and Steve.” Martoma said nothing to Gilman about the selloff, and a week later he flew to Chicago for the conference, bringing along Rosemary and their children, as he often did when he travelled. Gilman also did not know that Martoma had cultivated a second source connected to the clinical trials—Joel Ross, a New Jersey doctor who had been involved in the efficacy tests. Ross had plans to attend a dinner the night before Gilman’s presentation, at which he and other principal investigators would be shown the full data from the trials. Martoma met Ross in the lobby of the hotel immediately after the dinner. But Ross was mystified by their interaction. He was still moderately optimistic about bapi, having seen real improvements in the patients he was supervising, but Martoma was more skeptical. “He was always very detail-oriented,” Ross later testified. And, indeed, Martoma knew every detail of the results that Ross had learned at the dinner, moments earlier. Ross was unnerved: it was as if Martoma had been “in the room.” As Gilman made his presentation, the next evening, word of the ambiguous results hit the news wires. Tim Jandovitz, a young trader who worked for Martoma, watched in dismay as the news appeared on his Bloomberg terminal in Stamford. He checked Panorama, which showed that S.A.C. still held huge positions in Elan and Wyeth. Jandovitz believed that both he and Martoma had just lost more than a hundred million dollars of Steven Cohen’s money—and, along with it, their jobs. The next morning, he braced himself and went to the office. But when he consulted Panorama he saw that the Elan and Wyeth shares had vanished. Some time later, Martoma informed Jandovitz that S.A.C. no longer owned the stock. The two men had worked closely together, and Jandovitz was hurt that he had been left out of the loop. Martoma explained that the decision to sell had been kept secret on “instructions from Steve Cohen.” People outside the firm were equally startled to learn that S.A.C. had turned a potential disaster into a windfall. “tell me martoma got out of elan,” a friend of Jandovitz’s, who worked at J. P. Morgan, said in an instant message. Jandovitz replied, “w/out getting into detail, wed and this week have been great for us.” “i love it,” his friend wrote. Jandovitz agreed: “Stuff that legends are made of.” S.A.C., by dumping its shares in Elan and Wyeth and then shorting the stocks, made approximately two hundred and seventy-five million dollars in profit. That year, Martoma received a bonus of $9.3 million. The last time he saw Gilman—before the two men met again in court—was the day after the presentation, when Martoma invited Gilman to lunch at a Chicago hotel. “Did you hear about what happened to Elan stock?” Martoma said, adding that it had plummeted. The market does not like a drug that helps only half the people who receive it, he explained. Several months later, at the end of September, 2008, Gilman sent Martoma an e-mail with the subject heading “How are you?” Hi Mat. I haven’t heard from you in awhile and hope that all is well with you and your family. I hope that you have not been too terribly set back by the great turmoil in the markets plus the disappointing drop in Elan stock. . . . Anyway, no need to call, I have nothing new; I just wonder how you are faring. Martoma never responded. Regulators at the New York Stock Exchange monitor millions of transactions. Six weeks after the Alzheimer’s conference, investigators flagged the huge reversal by S.A.C. before Gilman’s presentation and alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the summer of 2009, Charles Riely, an attorney at the S.E.C., and Neil Hendelman, an investigator, began combing through hundreds of phone records, trying to identify a link between an insider at one of the drug companies and S.A.C. It took more than a year of investigation, but one day Riely and Hendelman** were looking through Gilman’s phone records and came across the cell-phone number of Mathew Martoma. Sanjay Wadhwa, who oversaw the S.E.C. investigation, told me, “That’s when we said, ‘This is probably the guy.’ ” By that time, federal authorities had been investigating Steven Cohen for years. But Cohen was a more elusive target than perhaps they had imagined. He described his firm as having a “hub and spokes” structure, with him at the center, pulling in information, while his specialized portfolio managers ran their accounts with a degree of autonomy. This meant that the authorities could arrest and flip low-level suspects who might describe the crooked culture of the place, but these employees would not necessarily be in a position to testify that Cohen knowingly traded on inside information. In the summer of 2009, the F.B.I. obtained a wiretap on Cohen’s home, a thirty-five-thousand-square-foot mansion in Greenwich, but the tap yielded no incriminating evidence. According to a person involved in the investigation, Cohen spent most of the month that it was operational in a house that he owned in the Hamptons. For a time, the agency wanted to place an informant in Cohen’s company, and groomed a stock trader who had once worked at S.A.C. to seek employment there again. But Cohen rejected the overture, explaining, in a 2011 deposition, that “rumors from people on the street” indicated that the trader was wearing a wire. In most white-collar cases, the authorities subpoena reams of internal communications, but this approach had limited utility with S.A.C., whose legal department warned employees not to “compose or send any electronic communication, or leave any voice mail message, if you wouldn’t want it . . . read by regulators.” On one occasion in July, 2009, a new portfolio manager sent Cohen an instant message saying that he was going to short Nokia on the basis of “recent research.” He apologized for this oblique rationale but explained that he had just gone through S.A.C.’s compliance training—“so I won’t be saying much.” Any time a written exchange approached potentially incriminating territory, Cohen insisted on oral communication. “I am getting coffee on tues afternoon with the guy who runs north American generics business,” a colleague once informed him. Cohen’s reply: “Let’s talk later.” Even when there appeared to be ironclad evidence that Cohen had received and acted upon inside information, his lawyers went to impressive rhetorical lengths to challenge it. One day in 2008, Jon Horvath, the analyst, sent an e-mail to two colleagues about an upcoming earnings report from Dell. His source, he wrote, was “a 2nd hand read from someone at the company.” One of the colleagues forwarded the e-mail to Cohen’s personal research trader, who forwarded it to Cohen—and then telephoned him. Two minutes after the call, Cohen began liquidating his position in Dell, which was worth ten million dollars. Yet when this trade became a focus in the Steinberg trial Cohen’s lawyers argued that Cohen’s decision to sell Dell was independent: although the “2nd hand read” e-mail was sent to his inbox, Cohen “likely never read” it. He received a thousand e-mails each day, the lawyers elaborated; he sat at a desk with seven monitors, and it was on the far left monitor that his Outlook inbox appeared. Moreover, the Outlook window was behind two other programs, and the window was minimized, allowing Cohen to see only five e-mails at a time: “Cohen would have had to turn to the far left of his seven screens, minimize one or two computer programs, scroll down his e-mails, double-click into the ‘second-hand read’ e-mail to open it, read down three chains of forwards, and digest the information.” Steinberg was ultimately charged with insider trading in the Dell case and convicted; he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, but, having posted a three-million-dollar bond, he remains free while pursuing an appeal*. Cohen was never charged. In theory, Steinberg could have testified against his boss, but he might not have been able to produce any additional evidence that Cohen had knowingly traded on inside information. Moreover, Steinberg was an old friend of Cohen’s who had worked with him for more than a decade, and was therefore unlikely to betray him. Martoma had no such loyalty to Cohen. After receiving his enormous bonus in 2008, he lost money in 2009. In 2010—down and out—he was fired. In an e-mail, a former colleague disparaged him as a “one trick pony with Elan.” Martoma and his family moved to Boca Raton, where he and Rosemary bought a large house in a waterfront community, for $1.9 million. Neither of them had a job, and they focussed instead on their kids (they had a third child in 2009) and on charity, establishing the Mathew and Rosemary Martoma Foundation and giving it an endowment of a million dollars. Martoma’s best friend from Duke, Tariq Haddad, who is now a cardiologist in Virginia, told me that Mathew has always been passionate about philanthropy. “He’s given ten per cent of his life savings away,” he said. “Over a million dollars, he’s donated.” On the evening of November 8, 2011, the Martomas returned home from running errands to discover two F.B.I. agents in their front yard. One of them, B. J. Kang, had been a key figure in the investigation of Steven Cohen. Kang has a buzz cut and a brusque demeanor, and he is known for carrying his service weapon—and several magazines of extra ammunition—with a regularity that may not be entirely necessary for an agent on the hedge-fund beat. “Get inside the house,” he told Rosemary. “This has nothing to do with you.” “I’m staying right here,” she replied. “Whatever you have to say to Mathew you can say to me.” Kang turned to Martoma. “Do you want to tell her or should I?” Martoma looked unsteady. Then he said, “You can go ahead and tell her if you like.” Rosemary was confused and terrified. She had no idea what this was about. According to Rosemary, Kang then said, “We know what you did at Harvard.” Martoma fainted. When Martoma was accepted at Harvard Law School, his father was so happy that he insisted on driving his son in a U-Haul all the way from Florida to Massachusetts. Martoma, who at the time was still using his birth name, did well in his first year. He was an editor of the Journal of Law & Technology, and he co-founded the Society on Law and Ethics. In the fall of his second term, he sent applications for judicial clerkships to twenty-three judges. But when a clerk for one of the judges scrutinized Martoma’s transcript, something looked off, and the clerk got in touch with the registrar at Harvard. On February 2, 1999, the registrar confronted Martoma. His transcript had apparently been doctored: two B’s and a B-plus had all been changed to A’s. (A remaining B-plus, an A, and an A-minus were left unchanged.) Martoma initially insisted that “it was all a joke.” But the school referred the matter to Harvard’s Administrative Board, which recommended expulsion. He fought the decision vociferously, hiring a lawyer and taking two polygraph examinations. There had been a misunderstanding, Martoma explained: he had altered his transcript not for the judges but for his parents. He brought the faked transcript home over winter break, and they were ecstatic. (The panel evaluating his case noted that Martoma was “under extreme parental pressure to excel.”) But, after showing his parents the transcript, Martoma continued, he had to leave town abruptly, so he asked one of his younger brothers to compile the clerkship applications that he had left out in his bedroom. Unwittingly, the brother picked up a copy of the forged transcript, and included it in the mailing for the judges. Martoma had discovered the mistake before being confronted by the registrar, he insisted, and had sent e-mails to the secretaries of two professors from whom he had sought recommendations, asking them not to send the letters, “as I am no longer looking for a clerkship.” The Administrative Board remained dubious, because the secretaries did not receive the e-mails until the night of February 2nd—hours after Martoma had been questioned by the registrar. The e-mails were time-stamped February 1st, and Martoma maintained that there had been some sort of server delay, because he had definitely sent them the previous day. His mother, father, and brother all testified before the board and backed his account. Martoma even turned over his laptop to a company called Computer Data Forensics, which produced a technical report for the Administrative Board analyzing the metadata of the e-mails in which he asked to withdraw the recommendations. The firm found that the e-mails had indeed been sent on February 1st. Nevertheless, Harvard finalized the expulsion. While contesting his dismissal, Martoma had moved to an apartment complex in Framingham, Massachusetts, where he became friends with a young M.I.T. graduate named Stephen Chan. The two began eating dinner together and training in martial arts at a local gym. Eventually, they started a business. Martoma’s parents took out a second mortgage to assist the enterprise, and Martoma and Chan hired several employees. Martoma told the employees that he was a Harvard-trained lawyer. The name of the company was Computer Data Forensics. Martoma had supplied Harvard with a forensic report issued by his own company. The partnership between Martoma and Chan ended, acrimoniously, not long afterward, with Martoma taking out a restraining order against Chan, and Martoma’s parents were forced to mediate with disgruntled employees (who had not been paid). Bobby Martoma, incensed with his son, called him “a complete liability.” Later that year, Martoma applied to business school at Stanford. Soon after being accepted, he stopped calling himself Ajai Mathew Thomas and legally adopted his current name. Stanford surely would not have accepted him had it known of his expulsion from Harvard, but because Stanford will not comment on the case it is impossible to know whether Martoma mischaracterized his year in Cambridge or left it out of his academic history altogether. To Ronald Green, his former supervisor at the N.I.H., he explained his departure from Harvard by pointing to the entrepreneurial opportunities available at that time. “The way I understood it, he dropped out to start a business, and it was booming,” Green told me. When I asked Rosemary Martoma when she learned about the expulsion, she said that Mathew had confided it to her early in their relationship. “I’m a full-disclosure person,” she explained. But the incident was a source of humiliation for Martoma and for his family, and it became a closely held secret. Even his best friend, Tariq Haddad, always believed that Martoma dropped out of law school; he learned the truth only recently, after Martoma was indicted. Martoma always feared exposure of the Harvard incident, Rosemary said: “It was like a dagger that had been hanging over his head.” (S.A.C. performed background checks on prospective employees, but it is not known whether the firm detected this blemish in Martoma’s record. Of course, S.A.C. could have learned of it and hired him anyway; forging a law-school transcript and mailing it to twenty-three federal judges demonstrates impressive comfort with risk.) When Martoma regained consciousness, Agent Kang told him that the F.B.I. knew about “the trade in 2008.” Both Rosemary and Mathew immediately understood what he meant. The other agent, Matt Callahan, hung back, but Kang was aggressive. “Your whole life is going to be turned upside down,” he said. “You’re going to lose all your friends, and your children are going to grow up hating you, because you’re going to live your years in a jail cell.” According to Rosemary, Kang said that the government would “crush” Martoma unless he coöperated. “We want Steve Cohen,” Kang said. Martoma was not an ideal star witness: if Cohen’s lawyers could find a path of escape through a minimized Outlook window, imagine what they might do to Martoma’s credibility on the stand by bringing up his Harvard career. Then again, criminal kingpins are often convicted on the testimony of morally dubious underlings. The key witness who put away John Gotti was Sammy (the Bull) Gravano, who had confessed to nineteen murders. A rap sheet was practically a prerequisite to testify against Whitey Bulger. And Martoma clearly possessed a dogged instinct for self-preservation. His parents still called him by his birth name, Ajai, which in Hindi means “Undefeatable.” But then something surprising happened. Martoma refused to coöperate. Agent Kang had already paid a visit to Sid Gilman. At an initial meeting at the university, and in several subsequent conversations, investigators asked Gilman if he had supplied confidential information about bapineuzumab to Martoma. Gilman repeatedly lied to them. “I was intensely ashamed,” he explained later. “I had betrayed my colleagues, myself, my university.” Kang told Gilman that he was a minor player in this saga—a “grain of sand”—and that the person the authorities were really after was Steven Cohen. Eventually, Gilman agreed to tell the government everything, in exchange for a promise not to prosecute him. Would Martoma flip next? In criminal cases where coöperation is a possibility, a defendant’s attorney goes to prosecutors with a “proffer,” explaining what the client might offer in exchange for lenient treatment. But, despite warnings from Agent Kang that if Martoma went to trial the F.B.I. would “ruin his life,” Martoma’s attorneys never broached the notion of a plea deal. Here was a hedge funder who might finally deliver Cohen and, because of his enormous profits from the bapi trade, would face extensive jail time if he didn’t. Yet Martoma was intransigent. Eventually, a team of F.B.I. agents returned to Boca Raton and, in front of the children, marched him out of his house in handcuffs. In financial and law-enforcement circles, many wondered why Martoma accepted the role of fall guy. One explanation suggested to me by numerous people was that a numbered account had been set up for the Martomas in some tropical banking haven. But this scenario struck me as unlikely. Suppose that Cohen did seek to witness-tamper in this way. Even if he did so in the billionaire’s fashion—through multiple intermediary layers of deniability—wouldn’t he be handing Martoma the ammunition for a lifetime of blackmail? If someone promised Martoma ten million dollars not to testify about securities fraud, what would stop him from renegotiating on the spot, by demanding twenty million not to testify about obstruction of justice on top of securities fraud? Even so, Cohen’s money was an inescapable factor in the case. After working briefly with a criminal-defense attorney named Charles Stillman, Martoma chose to retain Goodwin Procter, a major law firm with very high fees. But Martoma was not paying for his lawyers: S.A.C. was. So the attorneys advising Martoma on whether he should risk a jail sentence or testify against Cohen were sending their bills to Cohen’s company. After the U.S. Attorney’s office announced an indictment of Martoma, Cohen convened a company-wide meeting at S.A.C. and said that he was furious about the behavior of “a handful of employees.” Martoma was the eighth person who had worked for Cohen to be charged with insider trading—the largest number of individuals from any U.S. financial institution to be criminally charged in recent years. Even if Martoma didn’t turn on Cohen, the company was clearly in trouble. In March, 2013, lawyers for S.A.C. agreed to pay six hundred and sixteen million dollars to the S.E.C. in order to settle civil insider-trading charges. Several months later, the S.E.C. launched a separate case against Cohen personally, charging him with “failure to supervise” subordinates, and alleging that he received “highly suspicious information that should have caused any reasonable hedge-fund manager . . . to take prompt action.” (That case is still pending.) Last summer, the Department of Justice announced a criminal indictment of S.A.C.—though not of Cohen directly—alleging that the company had become a “magnet for market cheaters,” and that Cohen had presided over insider trading “on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.” Not long afterward, the firm pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, agreeing to pay a historic $1.8-billion fine. Cohen had always greeted allegations of impropriety at S.A.C. with bored disdain. When a lawyer asked him in a deposition in 2011 about Rule 10b-5—the federal regulation against insider trading—Cohen claimed not to know what it said. The lawyer pointed out that Cohen’s own compliance manual at S.A.C. spelled out the rule. Cohen responded that he didn’t know what the compliance manual said, either. The lawyer was incredulous: “You don’t know, sitting here today as the head of the firm, what your compliance manual says?” “That’s right,” Cohen said. “I’ve read it. But if you’re asking me what it says today, I don’t remember.” Not long after S.A.C. announced its settlement with the S.E.C., the news broke that Cohen had bought Picasso’s “La Rêve,” for a hundred and fifty-five million dollars—the second-highest price in history for a painting. While he was at it, he bought a new house in East Hampton, a waterfront property worth sixty million. The trial of Mathew Martoma began in January, 2014, and lasted a month. Blizzards had deposited huge snowbanks around the federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan, and every morning Mathew and Rosemary Martoma arrived in a chauffeured car and clambered, with their lawyers, over cordons of dirty snow. They had brought the children with them to New York and were staying at a midtown hotel. Mathew’s mother and father had come from Florida for the trial, and they sat in the front row, bundled in winter coats and scarves and looking solemn. Rosemary’s parents sat beside them. “Ladies and gentlemen, the case is not about scientific testing and it is not about trading,” the government’s lead lawyer, Arlo Devlin-Brown, told the jury. “The case is about cheating.” Martoma, wearing a dark suit, watched impassively as a parade of former S.A.C. colleagues testified; Rosemary smiled when she agreed with a witness and flared her nostrils when she didn’t. She wore eye-catching clothes, becoming an attraction for the tabloid photographers who clustered at the base of the courthouse steps. An article in Bloomberg Businessweek remarked on her poise in the courtroom and the defiant smile she maintained when she and Mathew walked in and out of the courthouse, hand in hand, “as if she’s walking a red carpet.” The government presented dozens of e-mails that Martoma sent to Cohen and other colleagues, and called on Joel Ross, the doctor from New Jersey, to recount how he shared inside information with Martoma. But the heart of the case was the testimony of Sid Gilman, who in the second week made his way, slowly, to the stand. Gilman had resigned from the University of Michigan, and administrators had scrubbed all traces of him from the institution: the wing of the hospital, the lecture series, the university’s Web site. His federal grant support disappeared, his former colleagues wanted nothing to do with him, and he was banned from the campus. He had lately been advising patients at a free clinic. “I had given a great deal to that university, and I am suddenly ending my career in disgrace,” he said. Gilman still dressed elegantly, his shirt and tie cinched tightly around his neck, accentuating his large, round head. But he was eighty-one and visibly frail. During five days of testimony, he looked marooned in the witness box, a shipwrecked man. Several lawyers suggested to me that Martoma’s attorneys should never have let the case go to trial, because the evidence against him was so conclusive that he didn’t stand a chance. But his defense team, a pair of lean and intense litigators, Richard Strassberg and Roberto Braceras, relentlessly attacked Gilman’s credibility as a witness. He had apparently told prosecutors that he had e-mailed a copy of the PowerPoint presentation to Martoma. But, the defense team pointed out, the prosecutors had failed to find any trace of that e-mail. At times, Gilman just seemed confused. Asked about the population of Ann Arbor, he said that it was fifteen hundred. (The population exceeds a hundred thousand.) Some of Gilman’s colleagues speculated that, after decades of studying neurodegenerative disorders, he was now succumbing to cognitive decline himself. Of course, this may be a generous interpretation of actions that many who knew him found inexplicable. “Nobody could believe it,” Anne Young told me. “To jeopardize his career for a hundred thousand dollars or so is insane.” Martoma, Strassberg told the jury, was “the quintessential American success story,” whereas Gilman was a confused old man who had been coached by the government. When speaking to Gilman, Strassberg combined the elevated volume you might use to address a deaf person with the patronizing tone you might employ with a seven-year-old. If this was a strategy, it backfired. Every time Strassberg asked whether Gilman hadn’t heard or understood something he said, Gilman bristled. “You’re slurring your words,” he snapped at one point. Martoma’s lawyers suggested that the information Gilman shared with Martoma was already publicly available. “There is nothing nefarious or improper about trying to get edge,” Braceras argued. “That was the job.” The lawyers challenged the government’s narrative of a special relationship between Gilman and Martoma, observing that Gilman had consultations with scores of other investors. But former colleagues of Gilman told me that the government’s story was plausible. “Sid was a mentor to so many people, and enjoyed that role, and was good at it,” Tim Greenamyre said. “I could certainly see how, if someone was cunning and perceptive, they could pick up on that, and take advantage of it.” As Gilman answered questions on the stand, day after day, he looked, above all, lonely. His son Todd lived nearby, in New Haven, but they had hardly spoken for years. On his final day of testimony, Gilman was asked what set Martoma apart from the other investors he had dealt with. “He was personable,” Gilman replied. After a pause, he said, “And he, unfortunately, reminded me of my first son. In his inquisitiveness. His brightness. And, sadly, my first son was very bright also, and committed suicide.” One matter that was not illuminated at trial was the substance of the twenty-minute phone call that Martoma had with Cohen on the Sunday morning after his trip to Michigan. If Martoma took the stand, prosecutors would attack his credibility by introducing evidence of his expulsion from Harvard Law School, so he elected not to testify in his own defense. Steven Cohen wasn’t called to testify, either. In 2012, he had been asked about the phone call during his deposition with the S.E.C. He said only that Martoma was “getting uncomfortable with the Elan position.” Asked whether he inquired why Martoma had grown uncomfortable, Cohen said that he remembered having done so—but that he could not recall Martoma’s answer. A second theory about why Martoma didn’t flip on Cohen was that any conversation the two of them had that day would have been deliberately opaque. Cohen would never be so foolish as to sit and listen while a subordinate laid out the full provenance of an illegal tip. At some firms, Judge Holwell told me, there is an unwritten “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, where the fact that a piece of information came from an insider would be conveyed not in so many words but with a facial expression, a tone of voice, or coded language (say, a conviction level of nine). The sociologist Diego Gambetta, in his book “Codes of the Underworld,” explains that people engaged in criminal conduct often evolve an elaborate semiotics to communicate with one another, because they cannot speak openly about their plans. One federal official who has investigated S.A.C. told me, “In the Mob, sometimes it’s just an expression. One expression means ‘Kill him.’ Another expression means ‘Don’t kill him.’ How do you bring that to a jury?” After deliberating for three days, the jury convicted Martoma of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. Rosemary wept as the verdict was read. The guidelines for his sentence would be based not just on the $9.3-million bonus he had received from S.A.C. in 2008 but also on the two-hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar profit that S.A.C. had made on the bapi trades. Yet Cohen was not charged with those trades, or even named as an unindicted co-conspirator. The judge, Paul Gardephe, went so far as to ask the attorneys to avoid discussing Cohen altogether, because he had not been charged with any crime. “General questions about how Steve Cohen conducted his trading, I think, are very dangerous,” he told them. “They represent a risk of opening the door to a broader examination of how Steve Cohen did business. . . . And I think we all agree that that is not a path we want to go down.” (In a subsequent ruling, Gardephe left little doubt about his own views, concluding that Cohen’s trades in July, 2008, “were based on inside information that Martoma had supplied.”) During the trial, Cohen was photographed at a Knicks game, sitting courtside with the art dealer Larry Gagosian. According to a recent article in New York, Cohen told his children that he felt betrayed by his subordinates. “People in the company have done things that are wrong, and they’re going to pay for what they did,” he said. “I didn’t do anything wrong.” Before Judge Gardephe delivered his sentence, Martoma’s family sent him a hundred and forty-three letters from friends and supporters, pleading for leniency. “We pressed him to excel until he maxed out,” Bobby Martoma wrote. “As a father, I wonder . . . whether I was wrong to dream as I did.” On September 8th, Gardephe sentenced Martoma to nine years in federal prison. Delivering the sentence, he invoked the deception at Harvard and suggested that there was a “common thread” between that transgression and this case: an “unwillingness to accept anything other than the top grade, the best school, the highest bonus—and the willingness to do anything to achieve that result.” Afew days after the sentencing, I took an elevator to the twenty-sixth floor of a skyscraper on Forty-second Street to meet with Rosemary and Mathew Martoma. I walked into a glass-walled conference room that seemed to hover over midtown. Martoma was there, wearing a neat V-neck sweater. He shook my hand, smiled warmly, and thanked me for coming. But he did not want to talk. Rosemary explained that she would speak on his behalf. She was wearing a cream-colored blouse, tan slacks, and a tiny gold crucifix around her neck, and after Mathew left the room we talked for nearly four hours. Things were looking dire for the Martomas. The government would likely take possession of their house in Boca Raton, and Judge Gardephe had ordered them to forfeit the millions of dollars that they have spread across several bank accounts, which would clear out their savings while still falling well short of the nine million dollars that they have been ordered to pay the U.S. government. When I consulted the tax returns of the Mathew and Rosemary Martoma Foundation, I discovered that the couple had not, in fact, given a million dollars to charity. Instead, after parking that sum in their tax-exempt nonprofit, they had given away smaller amounts to various charities. In 2011, they gave away only three thousand dollars; this included a check to the Florida chapter of the American Alzheimer’s Association, in the amount of two hundred and ten dollars. All the remaining money in the foundation will now go to the government. When I asked Rosemary why Mathew didn’t flip on Cohen, her answer did not match any of the prevailing theories. “He’s innocent,” she said. Martoma could not plead guilty to a crime he did not commit. Outside the courthouse, after the sentencing, Bobby Martoma had told me much the same thing, invoking the Ten Commandments and bellowing, “Thou shalt not bear false witness!” The government’s case was a fiction, Rosemary assured me. “At S.A.C., there’s an expectation that you’re using the resources to formulate a hypothesis, and that’s what he did,” she said. But Gilman had admitted to violating his own confidentiality agreement, I pointed out. He may have had “little mini brain infarcts, where he was slipping on things he shouldn’t have,” Rosemary said. But these were “irrelevant to Mathew’s trading.” Gilman had lost everything. Why would he lie on the stand about having committed these crimes? Because, Rosemary explained, when he was initially interviewed by F.B.I. agents, he lied to them, and at that point they had him on obstruction of justice. So the prosecutors could make him say anything they wanted. “His story was coerced,” she said. She told me about her grandfather, a lawyer in India who had worked alongside Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for independence. British authorities threw her grandfather into prison, where he contracted cholera and other ailments, from which he never fully recovered. Rosemary noted the “parallels” between her grandfather’s martyrdom and her husband’s. Rosemary’s mother, in a letter to Judge Gardephe, elaborated: “Mathew has given Rosemary courage by reminding her of her grandfather’s suffering for a noble principle, and that he too is standing for a noble principle, that is sticking to the truth.” While Rosemary and I spoke, Mathew retreated to an inner room in the law offices where we were meeting. Periodically, Rosemary left me alone in the conference room and went to confer with him. It was a discomfiting interview scenario, with Martoma lurking in the wings like Polonius. People who maintain their innocence after a criminal conviction are often desperate to get their stories out, and, each time Rosemary disappeared to debrief Mathew on our conversation, I half-expected him to walk back in with her, and tell me that he had been railroaded by the feds. But he never came. They had arranged for a single chicken-salad sandwich to be delivered, and it sat on a sideboard, wrapped in plastic. Eventually, alone in the conference room, I ate it. When Rosemary returned, she spoke at length about the duplicity of Sid Gilman. “He’s a strange man, and he compromised his values to save himself,” she said. The notion that Gilman and Martoma had a special relationship was “farfetched”—a fabrication of the prosecutors that Gilman had parroted. “There is no relationship outside of a cordial consulting relationship,” she said, mocking the notion that Gilman was genuinely moved by Martoma having arranged lunch at their initial meeting, in New York. She looked at me pointedly and said, “I mean, were you touched when we served a sandwich to you?” Throughout our conversations, Rosemary was quick, animated, and intelligent. But her account stood at odds with what I had witnessed during the monthlong trial and had encountered in my reporting. She stressed that, when Mathew visited Michigan that summer weekend before the 2008 Alzheimer’s conference, it was indeed because a relative had died. “Did he see Gilman while he was there?” I asked. “I don’t think he has a specific memory of it,” she replied. Early in our conversation, I had asked if Martoma felt vindicated by his acceptance at Harvard Law School, having been denied admission at Harvard College. After one of her visits with him, Rosemary returned to the room and said that she needed to correct one point: “Mathew did get into college at Harvard.” “As an undergrad?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “He was admitted and chose to go to Duke instead.” This struck me as hard to believe. I asked why Martoma, the very opposite of a rebellious kid, might defy his father’s deepest wish. She responded, vaguely, that Duke “was Southern” and “felt a little bit more comfortable to him.” I wondered if, on this and other points, Rosemary was simply lying to me. But as our conversation progressed it became clear that she ardently believed in her husband. She reminisced about her medical residency in Boston, when she would be on call overnight and Mathew would sleep in the hospital with her so that she wouldn’t be alone. She pointed to the many letters written to Gardephe as evidence of the degree to which Mathew remained a beloved friend and a role model for his extended family. “Every Indian parent I’ve known, they take the weight of their children on their shoulders,” she said. “When you look into the eyes of all the four parents that are left behind, every single heart is broken.” Mathew’s mother had told him recently that she wished she could serve his prison sentence for him, Rosemary said. She added, “I’ve said that to him, too.” Within this close-knit family, it seemed crucial to maintain that Martoma was going to prison for a crime that he did not commit, and it occurred to me that there might be one final explanation for his unwillingness to accuse Cohen of criminality. In order to implicate Cohen in a conspiracy, Martoma would have had to plead guilty and admit to being part of that conspiracy himself. Could it be that Martoma was prepared to leave his wife and family and spend the better part of a decade in prison for the sake of preserving their illusion that he was an honorable man? I thought of Gilman on the stand, abandoned by his friends and colleagues, while the first few pews in the courtroom were filled by Martoma’s extended family—by people who believed in him. Martoma is scheduled to begin his sentence, at a federal prison in Miami, next month. When I asked how Rosemary and the children would manage, she said, “I’m not sure.” The children are nine, seven, and five. “They understand Daddy’s going to jail,” she said. “I mean, as an adult, I’m having a hard time understanding it.” Neither side of the family has any savings to give them, she said, adding, “There is not, and never was, and never will be, any discussion of Steve Cohen taking care of us.” In April, S.A.C. ceased to exist, and Cohen’s company was rechristened Point72 Asset Management. Under an agreement with the government, it will be limited to investing Cohen’s personal fortune of roughly nine billion dollars. Cohen has announced that he will institute more robust compliance measures to prevent insider trading, and he has hired the Silicon Valley security company Palantir Technologies to monitor his traders. He has also reportedly banned certain kinds of instant messaging at the firm. When I asked Preet Bharara about the ultimate failure of his multi-year effort to catch Cohen, he responded, through a spokesman, that his office brings charges against “those for whom there is sufficient proof.” The S.E.C.’s lawsuit charging Cohen with “failure to supervise” will progress, as will a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of hundreds of Elan and Wyeth shareholders who lost money when Cohen shorted the stocks. Insider trading may not be a victimless crime after all—at any rate, not when the victims sue you. In August, the litigants amended their suit to include a racketeering provision, which alleges that Cohen, like a Mob boss, sat on top of a criminal enterprise. After Martoma’s conviction, Stanford Business School rescinded its original offer of admission, effectively stripping him of his degree. “What to make of the early interest in ethics?” his professor from Duke, Bruce Payne, asked. “A hugely ambitious guy wanting to know the exact contours of the boundaries that might limit him? Or an anchor to the windward for self-protection by someone already willing to break the rules to his own advantage? If it was the latter, I was conned, and conned quite effectively.” When I asked Rosemary about the future, she cried. “I don’t have the answers, but you know it is my goal to find them,” she said. “And I do pray that America will give us a chance to survive. And to thrive.” ♦ *An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Michael Steinberg was serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence. **An earlier version of this article misspelled Riely's and Hendelman’s names.

Dr. Roboto,6989,"In medical school, I watched a robot remove a woman’s uterus. The machine reminded me of a spider, but its arms held scissors, forceps, and a tissue grasper. The surgeon operating the machine made a few centimetre-long incisions in the patient’s skin and placed the instruments, along with a small camera, inside her body. Then, she moved to the other side of the room and controlled the robot’s movements using a video-game-like console. To my untrained eye, it was like watching science fiction. Not long ago, doctors used robots mainly for gynecologic and urologic surgeries, but over the past decade robots have become popular for all kinds of operations. Now we use them for surgeries on the head and neck, the heart, the digestive system, and more. In the field of general surgery, which focusses on abdominal operations, the number of robotic procedures rose more than fivefold between 2011 and 2013. It’s easy to see the appeal. Traditional open procedures typically involve big incisions; robotic surgeries leave impressively small scars. The use of robots has been linked to less blood loss, less pain after surgery, and faster recovery. Laparoscopy, an older form of minimally invasive surgery in which the instruments are attached to long poles that a surgeon holds outside the body, can also deliver these benefits, but some doctors have found that robotic surgery is easier to master, since laparoscopic instruments can be difficult to maneuver in small spaces like the pelvis. Still, there’s a lot that robots can’t do. They don’t guarantee better outcomes. For patients who need surgery to treat cancer, a robotic approach doesn’t necessarily provide more effective treatment; many studies suggest that laparoscopy and open surgery offer similar rates of disease recurrence and survival. Nor do robots improve surgeons’ skills. Dr. Julio Garcia-Aguilar, who is the chief of the colorectal service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York, and who performs robotic surgery, told me that the proficiency of the surgeon matters more than the approach. “I’d rather have short-term discomfort and long-term benefits with a good open surgeon than less pain this week and the tumor back in a year,” he said. There are also risks associated with using a robot. In March, 2013, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine issued an advisory to the state’s physicians after receiving reports of “patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery.” Surgeons who are inexperienced with robots take longer to operate; a procedure that could be completed in two hours using an older technique might take eight with a robot. The more time patients spend strapped to the operating table, the greater the chance of nerve damage. Then there’s the price: a robot typically costs millions of dollars, and each procedure also requires costly disposable equipment. A study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association compared robotic and laparoscopic uterus removals at more than four hundred hospitals, and found that the robotic procedures cost more than two thousand dollars more per surgery (with no improvement in the rate of complications). VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? “Rest assured, we waste just as much money as everyone else,” a department chairman joked when he informed me that his hospital owned two robots. A study published in January in the Annals of Surgery reported that hospitals are more likely to acquire robots if other hospitals in their immediate vicinity have them. Many hospitals, faced with the pressure to compete with high-tech programs, are advertising robots aggressively—on billboards, on YouTube, even at baseball games. Some may be overselling the benefits of the technology. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University analyzed the Web sites of four hundred U.S. hospitals and, in a study published in the Journal for Healthcare Quality, reported that the majority of sites claimed that robotic surgery offered an “overall better outcome,” and a third of the sites touted “improved cancer control.” (None of the Web sites mentioned risks.) A study by researchers at Columbia University investigated the marketing of robotic gynecological procedures and found that many hospital Web sites described robotic surgery as the “most effective treatment.” Jason Wright, who worked on the Columbia University study and is the chief of gynecologic oncology at the university, told me that many claims made about robotic surgery aren’t based on clinical evidence. “When you see an ad for a drug on television, the claims that are made have to be backed up by scientific data,” he said. “There’s not the same level of scrutiny for devices.” There is no standardized process for deciding whether surgeons qualify to perform robotic surgery. Hospitals set their own criteria. To help insure a baseline of skill, some surgical societies have recommended the use of proctors—experienced robotic surgeons who supervise procedures and provide help—until trainees can operate with the robot independently. But it’s up to the hospitals to adopt and enforce these requirements. The New York Times reported last year that when representatives of Intuitive Surgical, the company that manufactures the robot, pressured hospitals “to ease the training path for busy surgeons, to increase use of the equipment and to drive sales,” some hospital officials agreed to consider cutting back on the requirements. Geoff Curtis, a spokesman for Intuitive Surgical, told me by e-mail, “It is the hospital's responsibility to credential and privilege the surgeon and determine the nature and extent of observation, training and proctoring necessary.” The introduction of any new technology comes with tension, of course. “The discussions today are very similar to the ones we had twenty years ago with laparoscopy,” Garcia-Aguilar said. It takes time for surgeons to master a new technique, for regulation to catch up, and for patients to learn their options. The newest tool isn’t always the right tool. Novelty must give way to familiarity. And all surgery, by whatever means, remains a human enterprise. “I don’t think there’s anything magical about the robot,” Garcia-Aguilar said.

The Doctor Will See You Onscreen,8925,"One night last summer, when I was working as a medical student in an emergency room, a woman pulled me aside. Her left eye was pink and looked painfully irritated. She had been waiting for hours to get it checked but would have to leave soon to catch a train home. How much longer, she asked, before she could be seen? A doctor was able to evaluate the patient before she dashed out the door, but her dilemma struck me. We buy groceries, trade stocks, and chat with friends across the globe without getting out of bed. Yet seeing a doctor remains a fantastically old-fashioned routine: minutes of medical attention can cost hours spent in transit or in a waiting room. When the price of losing that time gets too high, we might not even bother to be seen. There’s a potential solution to this problem: using technology to deliver health care remotely. That approach, known as telemedicine, involves locating available doctors over the Internet and connecting with them, at a moment’s notice, using video chat. Telemedicine lets you see a doctor whenever and wherever you want, freeing you to choose a doctor based on merit rather than location. It can also improve the quality of medical care and reduce costs. Telemedicine works especially well for urgent care, which deals with issues that need prompt attention but can be diagnosed and treated without an in-person exam—respiratory illnesses or urinary tract infections, for example. But it has many other possible uses. A study published last month in Health Affairs focussed on an off-hours telemedicine service in a chain of Massachusetts nursing homes. When residents got sick, an outside physician could use two-way video-conferencing equipment to see them instead of going to the facility in person or transferring patients to a hospital. Homes that used the service regularly sent a smaller portion of residents to the hospital than those that didn’t. The cost savings for Medicare, which would have had to pay for those hospital visits, far exceeded the cost of the telemedicine service. In 2010—around the time that the nursing-home study was being conducted—telemedicine seemed on the verge of a breakthrough. Milt Freudenheim wrote, in the Times, that telemedicine was “gaining traction as never before”; Bernard A. Harris, Jr., a venture capitalist, told him that Americans were arriving at “a gold rush of new investment in telemedicine.” But there was a problem: many health-care providers weren’t on board. In the nursing-home study, for example, two of the facilities barely used their telemedicine services. Not surprisingly, their hospitalization rates were similar to those of facilities that didn’t have telemedicine capabilities. “Simply making off-hours telemedicine coverage available does not guarantee that nursing homes will use the service,” the study’s authors wrote. In this instance, the staff had no incentive to learn a new system. Avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations didn’t save them money—in fact, it cost them money. “As long as nursing homes pay for the service and Medicare realizes the savings that result, we suspect that the use of the service will be limited,” the authors wrote. In the wake of the Affordable Care Act, the outlook may be changing. Health-care providers are forming Accountable Care Organizations, large groups that win bonus payments from the government for meeting certain standards of quality and efficiency but lose money if their costs exceed target levels. Bundled payment schemes pay providers a fixed amount to manage a given medical condition, in contrast to the traditional model that reimbursed a la carte for each service. “In the past, we were paid for the process rather than the outcome,” Thomas Nesbitt, the associate vice-chancellor for technology at the University of California Davis Health System, told me. Now, doctors have an added interest in improving their patients’ health efficiently. That makes telemedicine newly attractive. “Physicians see that they can manage their chronic-disease patients on a regular basis and achieve better outcomes, and get financial rewards for that,” Nesbitt said. Policymakers are also warming to telemedicine. Medicare, which previously only paid for telemedicine in rural locations, extended its coverage this year to “the fringes of metropolitan areas,” according to the American Telemedicine Association. The number of states making telemedicine coverage mandatory for private insurance plans has also grown—from five in 2000 and twelve in 2011 to nineteen as of early March. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Interest and opportunity, of course, aren’t enough. There is also the question of execution—how to schedule virtual patients, document encounters, and ensure that health-care providers get paid. To simplify logistics, the U.C. Davis Health System has a telemedicine clinic that provides technical, operational, and billing support. “The physicians just show up,” Nesbitt said. But he acknowledged that, “eventually, if we want telemedicine to be more widespread, incorporating it into the normal workflow process is a barrier we will need to overcome.” Meanwhile, for-profit telemedicine companies, which compete with hospital systems for business, are gaining momentum. “Since the A.C.A., we’re seeing a lot of interest in the area,” Bob Kocher, a venture capitalist at the firm Venrock, told me. Kocher, who is also a physician and a former special assistant for health care in the White House, recently took part in Venrock’s investment in a telemedicine company called Doctor on Demand, which launched in December of 2013. Startups like Doctor on Demand have the potential to offer what Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, calls “disruptive innovation”—innovation from smaller firms at the “bottom” of a market. Eventually, these firms can displace industry leaders. In his book “The Innovator’s Prescription,” Christensen proposes that telemedicine can be disruptive if it is used to “extend care into areas of nonconsumption, where the alternative is no health care at all.” If competing against nonconsumption is telemedicine’s best bet, the people to woo are not payers, providers, or policymakers, but patients. That may be why Doctor on Demand is marketing its services directly to consumers. One of the company’s founders is Jay McGraw, the son of Phil “Dr. Phil” McGraw and the creator and executive producer of “The Doctors,” a daytime talk show about health and medicine. On his show, Dr. Phil recently demonstrated how the service might work. “If you wanted to see my throat…could I show it to you?” he asked a Doctor on Demand physician via video chat, aiming an iPhone camera at his open mouth. “What if you just need a prescription refill?…What about something like”—he feigned a cough—“Viagra?” The audience laughed and clapped. As gimmicky as these tactics seem, Doctor on Demand may have tapped into a psychological truth: behavior change is as much about emotion as it is about reason. Simply recognizing the benefits of telemedicine isn’t enough; patients must want to use it. “It’s like going from buying clothes in the store to online,” Pat Basu, the chief medical officer of Doctor on Demand, told me. “The user experience needs to be good, or they won’t do it.” Perhaps the user experience will never be good enough to replace face-to-face medicine entirely. Skeptics say that there is no substitute for human touch. In his 2011 ted Talk, titled “A Doctor’s Touch,” Dr. Abraham Verghese warned against losing the physical exam, stating, “We’re losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent, and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship.” Then again, as care becomes more accessible, the patient-doctor relationship could change for the better. By turning occasional encounters into ongoing dialogues, telemedicine could enhance, rather than diminish, the human capacity for connection. “A lot of people think it’s about the technology,” Nesbitt said. “But it’s really about a new model of care that the technology facilitates.” Rena Xu is a student at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Business School.

A New Kind of Free Speech: Drug Reps’ Pitches to Doctors,7791,"Can a pharmaceuticals representative tell a doctor that he should recommend Bupropion, an anti-depression drug, to help patients quit smoking? What about suggesting Zoloft to help with certain sex problems? Currently, the answer is no: when the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug, it specifies which uses may appear on the label, and it bars pharmaceuticals companies from promoting “off-label” uses to doctors. (Doctors themselves, however, may prescribe drugs for off-label purposes.) But pharmaceuticals companies and their lobbyists have raised concerns that this ban could violate the First Amendment. And at the recent annual meeting of the Food and Drug Law Institute, in Washington, D.C., Leslie Kux, the assistant commissioner for policy at the F.D.A., suggested that the agency is reconsidering its rules. You might be wondering what these labelling policies have to do with freedom of speech. Well, if you construe drug reps’ conversations with doctors as speech, then F.D.A. rules that restrict those conversations arouse First Amendment concerns. They limit what kind of “commercial speech”—the Supreme Court’s term for advertising and other messaging undertaken by for-profit companies—is allowed. For most of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court understood advertising and promotion to fall outside the bounds of the First Amendment: no matter how much a law restricted commercial speech, it couldn’t be challenged. Then, in 1976, the Court struck down a Virginia law that prohibited pharmacists from advertising the prices of the drugs they sold. The Justices reasoned that “the suppression of prescription drug price information,” whatever its upside, came at the expense of vulnerable consumers: “the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged.” In other words, the Virginia law restricted listeners’ access to speech (in the form of price information) that the First Amendment entitled them to. From these auspicious beginnings, the idea of commercial speech has transformed into a tool for big companies to fight regulation. In 2011, the Supreme Court struck down a Vermont statute that prohibited pharmaceuticals companies from getting access to information about the prescriptions doctors were writing—information that the companies then used for marketing purposes. The Vermont legislature saw the law as a run-of-the-mill privacy protection. But to six Supreme Court Justices the Vermont law amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on speech: by restricting the information that pharmaceuticals sales reps could gather, it limited what they could say while marketing the drugs. The case—IMS Health v. Sorrell—exemplified a newfound willingness among federal judges to view drug promotion as an issue of free speech. Now when large companies lose advertising-related battles in the legislature, they can resurrect the fights as lawsuits. In 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered the case of a pharmaceuticals sales rep, Alfred Caronia, who had been charged with “misbranding” Xyrem, a drug approved to treat some types of narcolepsy. At trial, Caronia had been found guilty of promoting Xyrem’s off-label uses to physicians—for example, recommending the drug to treat other sleep disorders—and had been sentenced to a year of probation and community service. The Second Circuit, relying on the Sorrell decision, determined that punishing Caronia for “promoting the lawful, off-label use of an F.D.A.-approved drug” was a violation of the First Amendment. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold At the time of the Caronia decision, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (phrma), a trade group that represents big biopharmaceuticals companies, had been mounting First Amendment arguments against restrictions on off-label promotion for at least a decade. In a 2002 filing with the F.D.A., phrma argued that F.D.A. rules concerning the dissemination of “truthful, non-misleading speech about lawful products and activities”—like the off-label prescription of drugs—should be “scrutinized” through the “First Amendment lens.” The organization has been “consistently noting” these problems for the past twelve years, according to Stephanie Fischer, a spokeswoman. But the recent Sorrell and Caronia decisions could give their arguments more traction. On March 3rd of this year, the F.D.A. solicited public input about whether, and to what extent, drug reps should be allowed to inform doctors about scientific research regarding off-label uses of drugs. In a response to the draft guidance, phrma urged the F.D.A. to make its regulations “conform with the First Amendment” so as to “ensure that healthcare professionals may benefit from scientifically accurate, data-driven information.” The message was clear: stop limiting the flow of information to physicians. phrma argues that doctors already prescribe drugs for off-label uses and don’t rely only on pharmaceutical labels to decide the best course of medical action. Mit Spears, the general counsel of phrma, argues that the right regulatory approach would be one that enables pharmaceutical sales reps to get drug studies, prescriber data, and other medically relevant information into the hands of doctors, to inform decisions about off-label uses. Other experts take a more skeptical view of off-label promotion. Amy Kapczynski, a professor of intellectual property and public health at Yale Law School, where I am a fellow, would caution the champions of off-label use to remember that there’s a reason these uses aren’t on the label: they haven’t been shown to be safe. Because privately underwritten studies rarely replicate the stringency of the research used in the F.D.A. approval process, off-label uses are simply not as reliable as their “on-label” counterparts. As Kapczynski put it, “Without testing, and rigorous and independent review of the results, we simply have no way of knowing how new populations will respond to repurposed drugs.” She offered the example of Gabitril, a drug approved to help treat epileptics. When Gabitril was promoted off-label to non-epileptics—for things like anxiety—the drug turned out to cause seizures. Another organization that responded to the F.D.A.’s March 3rd solicitation for public input was the American Medical Association, which came out in favor of letting sales reps incorporate scientific studies about off-label uses into their promotional materials but also emphasized that the information should be “accurate and unbiased.” In the abstract, this seems like a sensible compromise. But it’s not an easy balance to strike. As doctors continue to prescribe drugs for off-label uses, they need information about how those uses stand to affect patients. Yet the parties with the most information—pharmaceuticals sales reps—inherently have financial incentives to promote off-label uses. There’s good reason to be concerned about the distortion that can result from privately financed scientific research; after all, it’s one of the reasons we require F.D.A. approval of drugs in the first place.

"Get Out of Jail, Inc.",65078,"On a cold November afternoon, Harriet Cleveland, a forty-nine-year-old mother of three, waved me over from the steps of her pink cottage in Montgomery, Alabama. She was off to her part-time job as a custodian at a local day-care center, looking practical but confectionary: pink lipstick, a pastel yellow-and-pink tunic, and dangly pink earrings. We’d need to start walking soon, she explained. The job, which paid seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour, was the only one she’d been able to find for some time, and was four and a half miles away. As we set off beneath loblolly pines, she recounted the events that had led me to her doorstep: her arrest and jailing for a string of traffic tickets that she was unable to pay. It was, in part, a story of poverty and constraint, but it was also a story of the lucrative and fast-growing “alternatives to incarceration” industry. Cleveland’s troubles began in 2008, when a police roadblock went up in her neighborhood. She soon received several tickets for driving without insurance and without a license. “I knew it was wrong,” she told me, but she had to take her son to school and to travel to work. When she was unable to pay her fines, a judge sentenced her to two years of probation with Judicial Correction Services, a for-profit company; she would owe J.C.S. the sum of two hundred dollars a month, with forty of it going toward a “supervision” fee. Cleveland considered the arrangement a reprieve. The first year, Cleveland regularly reported to the J.C.S. office with cash in her purse, whatever she could put together, handing it to a woman in a crisp collared shirt, who she assumed was working for the state. But she quickly fell behind on payments, in part because her weekly cash deliveries sometimes went solely to covering the company’s supervision fee. She had lost her full-time day-care job the previous winter, after the local Hyundai plant cut workers’ hours, and employees stopped dropping their kids off each morning. Cleveland was broke. Instead of hiring someone to fix the holes in her bedroom walls, caused by shifting prairie soil beneath the house’s foundation, she stuffed towels in the cracks to keep out the cold. In early 2012, she turned over nearly all her income-tax rebate—some two thousand dollars—to J.C.S. But by that summer her total court costs and fines had soared from hundreds of dollars incurred by the initial tickets to $4,713, including more than a thousand dollars in private-probation fees. For much of the previous year, a J.C.S. officer had warned Cleveland that her probation would soon be revoked and her name placed on what Cleveland called the “jail list.” As she looked for full-time work, she rented an empty room in her home to an elderly stranger with dementia, and sifted through neighbors’ trash for soda cans to cash in at the scrap yard. For months, she felt hopeful that she could fend off a reckoning. Now, as we walked against the bitter wind, Cleveland paused to point out various landmarks. She gestured toward two modest white clapboards: “See that there? That’s Ralph Abernathy’s house. And Nat King Cole’s!” Earlier, we’d stopped at a curb where a birdhouse was stuffed with books; a piece of plywood nailed to its roof read, “Granny Jackson’s Little Free Library.” Cleveland often borrowed novels from the book box, relishing, in fiction, the very things that dogged her in real life: suspense and sudden plot twists. Cleveland told me that when she was first assigned to J.C.S. her probation officer had taken down the names and phone numbers of her family members. As she fell behind on her payments, the company began calling Cleveland’s relatives—her daughter, her estranged mother, her daughter’s paternal grandmother—to tell them that if she couldn’t come up with the money she would be sent to “sit out” her probation debts in jail. The size of her debt now seemed impossibly large, but months went by without any signs of trouble. Maybe the people at J.C.S. would be lenient. Within the private corrections industry, “alternatives to incarceration”—including probation services and halfway houses—used to be regarded as an afterthought. The size of America’s incarcerated population more than quadrupled in the three decades since 1980, and, in time, the private sector seized an immensely lucrative opportunity; between 1990 and 2009, the number of inmates in private prisons increased seventeen-fold, and revenues for the largest private-prison firm, Corrections Corporation of America (C.C.A.), reached $1.7 billion. In the past few years, however, politicians from both major parties have begun to turn against mass incarceration. Attorney General Eric Holder has routinely condemned the “inadvisable and unsustainable” policies that have made America’s prison population by far the largest in the world. In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie has denounced a “failed war on drugs that believes incarceration is the cure of every ill.” In Texas, Governor Rick Perry has helped redirect some two billion dollars from the prison economy toward alternatives like drug treatment. Incarceration rates have slowly declined since 2010; conventional private prisons may no longer be a growth industry. Some investors have begun to turn their attention to extra-carceral institutions, such as private halfway houses, electronic monitoring, “civil commitment” centers for sex offenders, and for-profit residential treatment facilities. Private-prison corporations themselves have begun to expand into the “alternatives” industry. The GEO Group now has an array of “community reëntry services” and treatment programs. In 2011, it acquired the country’s largest electronic-monitoring firm, BI Incorporated, for four hundred and fifteen million dollars. Last August, C.C.A. bought a California-based enterprise called Correctional Alternatives. Private-probation companies, too, have quietly taken off in recent years, often selling themselves as a cheap way to keep small-time offenders out of jail. In 2010, Judicial Correction Services made the magazine Inc.’s list of “the fastest growing private companies in America,” for the third year in a row; a year later, it was acquired by Correctional Healthcare Companies, which now boasts of attending to the “full spectrum” of offenders’ lives: “pre-custody, in custody, and post-custody.” Probation companies say that they provide a vital social service, with an emphasis on rehabilitation. “At the very center of our mission is keeping probationers out of jail by helping them successfully complete probation,” J.C.S. declares. (For the most part, these companies deal not with felony probationers—“probation” as it’s usually understood—but with people whose offenses are often too minor to merit jail time.) Florida Probation Service has adopted the motto “Probation with a heart,” and emphasizes that its supervision services have lofty social ambitions: “With just a small amount of desire from the probationer, together we can achieve the restoration of a successful life.” In addition to debt collection, many companies offer electronic ankle bracelets, drug testing, and behavioral-therapy courses with names like Cage Your Rage. With municipal budgets under enormous strain across the country, the industry has also pitched itself as a source of revenue for small courts. “If your municipality is looking to reduce incarceration rates and to increase the collection of fines and court costs in the municipal court, please give our office a call today,” the Georgia-based Freedom Probation Services advertises. In return for an exclusive contract with a municipality, companies like Freedom Probation offer their services to courts for free. The private-probation business has established a presence in such states as Utah, Missouri, Montana, and Colorado, although its home remains in the Cotton Belt. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER In Pursuit of the Perfect Storm The industry aims to shift the financial burden of probation directly onto probationers. Often, this means charging petty offenders—such as those with traffic debts—for a government service that was once provided for free. These probationers aren’t just paying a court-ordered fine; they’re typically paying an ever-growing share of the court’s administrative expenses, as well as a separate fee to the for-profit company that supervises their probation and enforces a payment schedule—a consolidated weekly or monthly set of charges divided between the court and the company. The system is known as “offender-funded” justice. But legal challenges to it are mounting, amid concerns about abuse, corruption, and the use of state penalties to collect private profits. In a wide range of cases, offender-funded justice may not result in justice at all. Some courts seem to take seriously the probation companies’ promises. One recent morning, in the faded mining town of Bessemer, Alabama, a judge named Lynneice Washington presided thoughtfully over a room of people packed into battered church pews that had been repurposed as court benches. Small brown bugs crawled in and out of empty Bible racks, and mildew prompted a chorus of sneezes. “Good grades—that’s awesome!” Washington told a seventeen-year-old boy who was struggling to pay a speeding ticket. When the boy confirmed that he had a job at a local Piggly Wiggly, she sent him home with more time to round up the cash. A young homeless man shuffled up to the bench. Judge Washington scolded him for disregarding court fines: “This isn’t Burger King, ‘Have it your way’! When the court tells you to do something, you have to do it.” After he explained that he had a job at Radio Shack, she gave him more time to pay up, pointing him to a woman standing at the back of the court who wore an Alabama Court Services badge. “All services are provided at no charge to the courts that we serve,” A.C.S. declares. “All programs are offender funded.” “Probation services is more than just a collection agency,” Washington told the assembled. “They can help you find housing, help you get a job.” Many in the court looked relieved to hear about the company’s services. “I thought it was going to be ‘three hots and a cot,’  ” said Eugene Acoff, a gray-haired employee of Klean Kuts Lawn Care, who was waiting his turn in court between landscaping jobs. Probationers in other municipal courts around the state have a harder time of it. Although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Bearden v. Georgia (1983), that probation cannot be revoked, or jail time dispensed, simply because a defendant is too poor to pay a fine, few judges check to see if defendants have the means to pay before jailing them. Many cases are resolved in less than two minutes, without a lawyer representing the defendant or a court reporter present. As I travelled around Alabama, I watched more than a hundred defendants face possible jail time for unpaid fines tied to minor offenses. Some defendants were simply careless, and there is no constitutional impediment to jailing a driver who willfully refuses to pay a ticket. But many people I met were indigent; some were homeless. Like Eugene Acoff, they often belonged to the growing number of Alabama residents who are at once employed and unable to make ends meet. Nearly fifty miles east, in the small town of Childersburg, an icy atmosphere prevailed in the court of Judge Larry Ward. (Another municipal court that he presided over, in nearby Harpersville, had been shut down in 2012, after a scathing legal ruling declared the debt-collecting practices there “disgraceful.”) On the afternoon I visited, last fall, shortly before Ward’s retirement, dozens of defendants pleading guilty formed a line curling out the door. There was hardly a lawyer in sight. Tense whispers swept the courtroom each time Judge Ward sent a debtor to jail. “Alicia,” people murmured, like a round of telephone, as a stout, sad-looking woman with spiky blond hair was handcuffed and escorted out by police. Meagan Poole, a young mother who had just been released from medical care, was threatened with jail after she failed to pay several hundred dollars in court costs and J.C.S. supervision fees tied to an expired license plate. She was thirteen dollars short. “Either you go get the money or you’re going to jail,” Judge Ward said. She ran to the parking lot to see what she could shake from friends and family by the 5 p.m. deadline. “Here’s how it is,” said a gaunt construction worker who was waiting for a public-intoxication hearing outside the courthouse in Clanton, a peach-farming town at the center of the state. “If you don’t have seven hundred dollars, then the company makes you pay one thousand four hundred.” He shook his head. “They’re jacking it all up!” He rattled off the names of friends and family members also “on J.C.S.”: a brother, a brother-in-law, a cousin, a pink-sneakered friend standing beside him. “They really don’t care what you do, as long as you hand over your money,” a student in his twenties told me outside the J.C.S. office in Montgomery, where he was dropping off his payment. “It’s like paying protection to the Mafia.” He shrugged, gave a small laugh, and climbed back into the rusty Jeep he’d driven, illegally, to make the payment—his license had been suspended, but he had to report regularly to the J.C.S. office for his payments in order to avoid jail. Harriet Cleveland often did the same, when she still had a car. “I know I done wrong,” she told me, about her practice of driving without a license to pay off fines for driving without a license. When a warrant was finally issued for her arrest, she figured that fighting back would get her nowhere; the law had her on the hook. On a windy night in Birmingham, I sat down at the Rogue Tavern with two state judges who are concerned about the rise of private probation. “Welcome to a Third World country,” Tommy Nail, who has a longtime seat on the Tenth Judicial Circuit, said as he beckoned me over to a table. A weathered man in his late sixties, Nail is an outspoken critic of private probation. “There is clear legal precedent that you can’t incarcerate someone because they’re indigent,” he told me. When courts are driven to seek revenue, Nail said, their objective is “no longer in the best interest of the defendant, or society.” “We’re no different than a payday or a title-loan company, if our central purpose is collections,” Stephen Wallace, a criminal-court judge in his thirties, added. The trend, Wallace pointed out, is rooted in a financial crisis facing America’s small courts. “The legislature cut budgets so drastically that the judiciary have to be debt collectors,” he said. This predicament is hardly unique to the states where private probation operates. Although debtors’ prisons were abolished by federal law in the eighteen-thirties, people across America are routinely jailed for fees and fines that they are too poor to pay. Spokesmen for the private-probation industry stress that only judges, not the firms under contract, have the authority to decide who goes to jail for nonpayment, and who counts as indigent. But private-supervision fees, which are often significantly higher than what states would charge for equivalent services (many states charge nothing at all), can add substantially to judicial fines, and Wallace notes that companies rely on the threat of jail time to generate collections. Nail worries, too, that competition among probation companies for exclusive contracts with local courts invites corruption. Not long ago, in Tennessee, a judge was sent to prison after an F.B.I. probe found him taking kickbacks estimated to be as large as a hundred thousand dollars from a private-probation company and a driving school in exchange for sending them offenders. In Idaho, a decade-long experiment with private probation collapsed following complaints of profiteering and illegal fees. (Public probation has had its share of scandals, too, often owing to the simple fact that government-run offices in most states are grossly overstretched.) Even lawful dealings can reveal uncomfortable intimacies between public and private interests. As a prosecutor in Hoover, Alabama, Charlie Waldrep brought cases against individuals who were often sentenced to probation with J.C.S. At the same time, as an attorney in private practice, Waldrep represented J.C.S. when it acquired a profitable exclusive contract with the city of Birmingham, in the same county. The prominent Birmingham firm where Waldrep is a partner has also represented J.C.S. in an ongoing lawsuit, defending it against allegations that the firm had violated the constitutional rights of indigent probationers. Gayle Gear, a Birmingham lawyer and activist who often lobbies on behalf of poor probationers, says, “You would have to close your ears, shut your eyes, and grit your teeth to not think that gives the appearance of impropriety.” The real problem, in her view, arises from “the inherent conflict of interest when the court is making money off of a private enterprise.” She has asked the U.S. Justice Department’s Office for Civil Rights to investigate the issue. “J.C.S. was in Hoover long before I got there,” Waldrep told me. “I don’t have anything to do with anybody being placed on probation with them. I didn’t get paid more or less in Hoover, or anywhere else, because of representing them.” Decisions about probation, he noted, ultimately rest in the hands of judges, not prosecutors. In such a context, “private-probation companies serve a very useful purpose,” he went on, since “they shift the cost of probation onto the person who was irresponsible in the first instance.” “There are a lot of reputable, honest people in this industry,” David Hamil, who runs his own small private-probation firm in Acworth, Georgia, told me. The key, he thinks, is to encourage more transparency about the scale of profits, and to institute regulations that prevent profiteering. “To be fair and treat folks right, we may not make a million bucks out of the gate, but we’re going to provide a service and we’ll be able to go to sleep at night and not have to look over our shoulder.” Both transparency and oversight are currently in short supply, however. This past February, Human Rights Watch published a report that catalogued problems endemic in private-probation services across the South, including “easy opportunities for corruption,” the wielding of “coercive power” against debtors and their families, and “Kafkaesque” electronic-monitoring sentences for minor crimes, which subject offenders to steep surveillance fees. The report found that these problems were “not a consequence of probation privatization per se” but what comes to pass when “public officials allow probation companies to profit by extracting fees directly from probationers, and then fail to exercise the kind of oversight needed to protect probationers from abusive and extortionate practices.” Last fall, I spoke with Jack Long, a Georgia attorney who filed a habeas petition on behalf of a client who, after stealing a two-dollar can of beer from a convenience store, was ordered to spend a year wearing an ankle bracelet operated by a company called Sentinel Offender Services. The man wound up owing more than a thousand dollars to the company in fees and late-payment penalties, and started selling his blood plasma to keep pace. It wasn’t enough. Eventually, a judge whose court had an exclusive contract with Sentinel jailed him for the unpaid fees. Long told me that he’s met dozens of probationers who were jailed because of Sentinel’s electronic-monitoring bills, most of which, he argues, were not authorized by any legal statute. “Imagine if every hospital or credit-card company were allowed to do that,” Long said of Sentinel’s practice of turning debtors back to the state to be jailed. “There’s nothing wrong with making a profit, but our court system is not a business, and our courts should not be used as a profit channel.” In September, a state Superior Court judge ruled that part of Sentinel’s operation “offends fundamental tenets of due process,” and prohibited the use of electronic monitoring for misdemeanors. The ruling was stayed while the company is appealing. Back at Birmingham’s Rogue Tavern, Tommy Nail grew exasperated as he described how politicians, reluctant to raise taxes, have invited abuses by making municipal courts ever more reliant on high collection rates. (Alabama has the lowest state and local tax collections per capita in the nation.) “When you inject a profit motive into the criminal-justice system, you’re opening it up to corruption and abuse,” he later told me, adding, “You are asking the poorest of the poor to fund the court system, and that’s what’s causing all of these abuses, in my opinion.” Stephen Wallace stressed that probation is meant to be a legal sentence with a precise duration. But in Alabama, as in Georgia, private companies often continue to collect fees and fines from debtors long after their legal authority to do so has elapsed. “It’s in their best interest to keep the collections process going, instead of calculating when probation has expired,” Wallace explained. “They’re terrorizing people.” Harriet Cleveland didn’t share Nail and Wallace’s distrust. Her weekly trips to the J.C.S. office were a hardship, but she also considered them an act of penance. “She was very nice,” Cleveland said of her probation officer. “She would listen to me, but it wasn’t her job to help me get a job. She’d just say, ‘You’ll go back to court’—which I knew meant jail—‘but bring me some money and I can stop that.’  ” Cleveland told me another reason that she felt loyal to the J.C.S. office: its employees had been mercifully understanding on an occasion when she did something “terrible.” It was around the time that Cleveland faced foreclosure on her home, in May, 2012, just before her utilities were shut off. She had been briefly jailed twice for failure to service her debts. The amount continued to compound; every six months, she owed two hundred and forty dollars in supervision fees. Unless she quickly came up with some cash, she feared that she would be sent to jail for a longer time, and lose the part-time custodial job she had found. Then, one day, her youngest child, a junior in high school, forgot his backpack at school. When Cleveland picked it up, she discovered fifty dollars in one of its pockets—“an act of God,” she said. She hurried to the J.C.S. office and handed over the cash, explaining tearfully, “This is my son’s money.” “You do what you have to do, Ms. Cleveland,” her probation officer replied, striking Cleveland’s name off the list of people to be reported to the court that day. Stealing from her son sent Cleveland into a spiral of self-reproach, and damaged their relationship. He hardly spoke to her for months. “He still ain’t forgiven me for that,” she told me. According to Foster Cook, the director of a program at the University of Alabama called Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities, actions like Cleveland’s are common. Cook recently conducted a survey of more than sixty private probationers after he noticed that many of his clients in addiction programs were “buried” under court debts that often created more problems for taxpayers than they solved. The vast majority of respondents had forgone rent, groceries, medicine, or all three to pay fees to private-probation firms. A third had committed an illegal act, such as selling drugs or stealing, to make their payments. Cleveland redoubled her efforts to find better-paying work, studying the job-counselling signs at the probation office. “Women’s Interview Attire,” one poster read, listing items that she could only covet: “Solid color, conservative suit,” “manicured nails,” “portfolio or briefcase.” Another sign, “Top Reasons You Can’t Find a Job,” summed up Cleveland’s troubles: “Lack Confidence”; “gaps in work history that are unexplained or unaccounted for” (unless “jailed for debt” was a sufficient explanation); “Phone Number Disconnected Often.” Cleveland rarely heard back when she dropped off her handwritten résumé at gas stations, fast-food restaurants, and toy stores. Operating on tips from friends, she began walking through abandoned homes to gather metal parts to resell. After a neighbor complained, Cleveland was sent to jail for five days on a trespassing charge, and was threatened with yet another fine. Although the period of her legal probation had expired that March, J.C.S. continued to collect what little it could from her and warned that revocation—meaning, most likely, more jail time—was inevitable if she didn’t increase her payments. By then, she felt that she had exhausted every avenue, including taking out a title loan on her car at an annual interest rate of three hundred per cent. (The car was repossessed.) She had reason to worry that she would lose her home. Soon, J.C.S. gave up on trying to collect more from her and turned her case back to the court. Last June, Cleveland received a letter from the District Attorney’s office. “Balance Due: $2,714,” it warned. “You must pay this amount in full . . . or you may be arrested.” Cleveland noticed that the amount she owed was far higher than the original fees she had chipped away at for more than two years, and she called the D.A.’s office, desperate for an explanation. Only much later did she learn that the D.A. had nearly doubled her fines because of her failure to pay, adding a thirty-per-cent collection fee, a warrant fee, and other surcharges. Terrified of another jailing, but broke, Cleveland failed to appear in court as ordered. She hoped that her case would slide by until her tax rebate came, in January. On a Tuesday morning in August, Cleveland was at home babysitting her two-year-old grandson when a policeman rolled up in an unmarked Chevy. She had left her front door open to allow in the breeze. “Can I speak to Harriet Cleveland?” the officer asked. Cleveland let him inside, to the living room she’d decorated with a Thomas Kinkade poster, a big fish tank, and family photographs. He placed her under arrest. Cleveland panicked, crying, “I’ve got my grandbaby here!” She called her eldest son to come pick up the child, and changed out of her pajamas. Then she was led in handcuffs to the back of the police car, and taken to a cell in Montgomery’s city jail. She was sentenced to spend the next month there unless she could come up with seventeen hundred dollars—a policy known as Pay or Stay. She slept on the floor, using old blankets to block the sewage from a leaking toilet. She quickly made friends, though. That was her way. As a child growing up in the nineteen-seventies in Montgomery’s Gibbs Village projects, one of the most violent in the state, Cleveland had a watchful nature that her aunt called “grown-folks sense.” She studied the adults around her and learned how to detect trouble before it came, even if she couldn’t fend it off. Sometimes that meant making herself unseen. She had a speech impediment, and learned to avoid her classmates’ taunts by staying silent. Now, as an adult, she kept an eye out for fellow-invisibles. In jail, she helped a woman give birth on the floor of the cell, laying down a towel and massaging her as other women screamed for medical help. None arrived; the baby was stillborn. Early in her jail stay, she was visited by an attorney named Sara Zampierin and a researcher named Jacob Denney, both with the Southern Poverty Law Center. At the courthouse on the day of her sentencing, Denney had approached Cleveland’s eldest son and told him that Cleveland’s arrest appeared to violate state law and the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. His organization could help the family try to get her out of jail. Now Zampierin and Denney had come to the Montgomery jail to see if Cleveland would consider filing suit against the court. Cleveland was tired of sleeping on a sewage-soaked floor, far from her kids, for traffic debts that felt insurmountable. She wanted to keep her job, and her home. She agreed to file suit. She wasn’t alone. Across Alabama, a series of legal challenges alleging constitutional violations have been brought against private-probation companies and courts. Often, the plaintiffs are people who hardly imagined themselves to be fight-the-man types. Last November, I ate barbecue with Tim Fugatt, a church music director in the pinprick town of Sylacauga. In early 2012, while he was preparing for services on a Sunday afternoon, police came to his door, threatened him with a Taser, and locked him up because he’d fallen behind on J.C.S. probation costs tied to driving with an expired license plate two years earlier. His wife, Kristy, was jailed the same day, on similar charges. The couple had used their car to visit their son, who had been hospitalized for a serious neurological condition that later proved fatal; they had informed the company of their dire financial straits and provided medical records. The Fugatts’ lawyer, Danny Evans, told me that J.C.S.’s fee-collection methods are like “putting your foot on the necks of the most vulnerable people.” Zampierin and Denney returned to the Montgomery jail a few days after their first visit. Cleveland learned that J.C.S. was a private enterprise that had made profits from cases like hers, and that courts were legally required to determine whether a person had the ability to pay before revoking probation for nonpayment. She was excited by the return visit, but she wasn’t sure how much to hope for. She was worried about whether she’d still have a home when she got out; her tenant with dementia had bounced two rent checks. “I felt a little relief, but not much,” she recalled. “I told myself, We’ll just have to wait and see.” Probation and other institutional alternatives to incarceration date to mid-nineteenth-century reform movements. The aim was to remedy the problem that “houses of correction” seldom lived up to their name. In 1841, a wealthy Boston cobbler named John Augustus tendered bail for a man awaiting sentencing for public drunkenness. Augustus brought the man home for three weeks and gave him a bed, hearty meals, and help finding a job. When the defendant returned to court, the judge was impressed enough by his sobriety that he waived the man’s prison time and dropped his fines to a penny. Augustus called his institution “probation,” from the Latin for “to test, to prove.” His personal scroll of supervisees soon grew to sixteen feet. Around the same time, the Quaker abolitionist Isaac T. Hopper founded the Prison Association of New York, in part to support inmates returning home to their families. His daughter, Abby Hopper Gibbons, went further, establishing the Home for Discharged Female Convicts in a brick Greek Revival row house in the East Village, where a small group of women and girls fresh from prison would study the Bible and receive training in basic skills like sewing. When rehabilitation was deemed complete, they were given work as domestic servants. Most of the women had been locked up for “intemperance.” By the time they left the home, after months of no cursing, no drinking, and lots of singing around a grand piano, few remained in the throes of addiction. Gibbons’s halfway-house concept won early converts; the Prison Association of New York boasted that its homes cut recidivism to less than five per cent. The Times declared in 1862 that the institution “has convinced us that the cheapest as well as the surest protection to society against the bad, is to make them good; to convert felons into upright and virtuous citizens.” In recent years, small nonprofit and religious treatment homes with state and local contracts have been bought out or replaced, in many states, by large-scale halfway-house companies. These organizations shelter hundreds, even thousands, of people on their way back from prison, and offer drug treatment, stable housing, and job training. As with the private-probation industry, they have allowed penal corporations to expand beyond prison walls. Some halfway-house facilities are offshoots of private prisons; the GEO Group’s Reëntry Services, for instance, promises “safe, secure alternatives to detention that are proven to reduce recidivism.” Others, like the New Jersey-based Community Education Centers, are independent companies devoted to helping “each offender to make a successful transition back into their community.” One of the nation’s biggest commercial halfway-house operators is Avalon Correctional Services. Founded in 1985, Avalon is headquartered in Oklahoma and also operates in Texas and Wyoming, with bids to expand further. The company’s founder, Don Smith, reportedly worked his way up from laboring in oil fields, gas stations, and grocery stores, and recently purchased a mansion in a wooded area outside Oklahoma City. In 2001, a profile in the Tulsa World noted that Smith had set out looking for “a recession-proof niche.” Halfway-house programs turned out to be a savvy bet. In 2012, Oklahoma, which has one of the nation’s highest incarceration rates, adopted reform legislation known as Justice Reinvestment, which is expected to curtail the growth of the state’s prisons by eighteen hundred beds over ten years; some of the savings—a projected hundred and twenty million dollars—would be devoted to rehabilitation. Avalon has been well placed to meet the need for prison alternatives. According to promotional materials, the company’s approach “Reduces Crime” and is “More cost effective than building new prisons, Reduces overcrowding, Saves Taxpayers Millions of dollars, Generates Revenue.” Brian Costello, Avalon’s C.E.O., told me in an e-mail, “Our halfway-house focus is gainful employment, one of the best indicators of future success.” But when I visited Tulsa in December I heard troubling stories from former employees and residents about Avalon’s for-profit homes for men and women in the city. Soon, I received an envelope in the mail stuffed with hundreds of pages of incident reports about drug use, sales, and overdoses at the men’s facility. The envelope contained a copy of a handwritten letter to state authorities from a onetime Avalon resident named Patrick Harvey, describing an unnerving code of discipline. Offenders were ordered by staff to beat each other bloody, for punishment or sport, Harvey wrote: “We were told to fight or we would be jumped on.” He was writing from jail, where he feared being seen as a snitch. “I was just wanting to brief you on what’s going on and maybe you can help please! Please! Please! I have a wife and three kids.” Other documents in the envelope revealed an investigation at the jail by state Department of Corrections officials, who found that half a dozen offenders had arrived there from Avalon after having been beaten, some so badly that they had to be hospitalized. One man was described as being “forced to fight other offenders while staff and offenders made bets.” Other men echoed Harvey’s description of widespread drug use, and what he called “extortion big time.” I spoke with former halfway-house staff who confirmed these claims and took them further. Rich Lohman, a former Avalon case manager who spent more than five years working for the company before losing his job, believes that the beatings had an economic motive: instead of using established means of punishment, which typically required residents to be sent back to prison for infractions like escapes or drug sales, facility administrators relied on “informal discipline” to insure that offenders remained “a big six-foot pile of money in a bed.” (For each bunk occupied at Avalon, the company reportedly receives more than thirty dollars a day; an inmate “shipped out” on account of discipline means a loss of that revenue.) In January, a Tulsa civil-rights lawyer named Louis Bullock sent me a video captured on a cell phone inside the facility. It showed what Avalon residents called “fight night,” an event allegedly organized by the staff, where two shirtless young men pounded each other as onlookers placed bets. (One called out, “Sock that nigger!”) “In all of these years, I’ve never seen anything as out of control and destructive as the environment that they created at Avalon, the openness of the inmate-to-inmate violence,” Bullock told me. He had spoken to half a dozen inmates, who had remarkably consistent stories of enduring, or dispensing, vicious beatings, and is now preparing to sue on their behalf. Of another set of beatings, he said, “They called it ‘taking them to court’—that was used as a disciplinary tool. “Clearly, this was so that the inmates wouldn’t be moved out of the facility, so that they would keep their beds full,” Bullock went on. “That’s why the drug use was so widely tolerated—they’d start losing people to occupy their beds if they busted that.” (One former resident told me that he had relapsed within seventy-two hours of his arrival, upon finding “a dope man in almost every room. In one room you could go and get the K2”—a hallucinogen—“in another room you could go and get the ice, down the hall you can go get the weed, and in another room you could go get the pills.”) Avalon officials had denied rumors of fight nights at the halfway house. “If they’re fighting, then they must be using cotton gloves, because there’s nobody hurt,” an administrator named Donnie Coffman told the Oklahoman’s Graham Lee Brewer last November. Then, shortly after my conversation with Bullock, the video he sent me hit the local news, followed by additional allegations in papers like the Tulsa World. It was a major setback for Avalon, which had been lobbying for a significant expansion. The Department of Corrections disclosed its own investigations into the men’s facility in Tulsa, and then suspended the company’s contract. “The violations are so serious that the Department will begin depopulating Avalon Tulsa immediately without notice,” Reginald Hines, a deputy director in the Department of Corrections, wrote in a public letter to the company, citing problems with “count, security, possession of contraband and offender safety.” (Avalon acknowledged the existence of “isolated incidents” and, in a press release, said it would institute changes. The company also noted that “incidents occur daily at every correctional facility, public or private,” and characterized the crackdown as “politically motivated retaliation.”) Concerns have not been limited to Oklahoma. Several years ago, in Colorado, an Avalon halfway house was shuttered after a state public-safety examination revealed lax security, poor drug-testing procedures, and tunnels where weapons and drugs were stashed, as well as allegations of sex between offenders and staff in a so-called Boom Boom Room. More recently, in Texas, the escape of a serial rapist from an Avalon facility drew public scrutiny, and prompted the company to promise to review its security procedures. Down the road from the Avalon men’s facility in Tulsa is the Turley Residential Center, the company’s female facility. The vast majority of Turley’s residents spend their days in a work-release program, prepping Taco Bell burritos or cleaning motel rooms or styling hair. Much of the women’s salaries goes back to the state to repay the cost of their incarceration, making the arrangement a good deal for taxpayers. (Housing a woman at an Avalon facility costs the state around thirty-five dollars a day, compared with the approximate forty-five-dollar expense of prison.) According to Brian Costello, some of the jobs that women obtained in work release have helped them launch careers. He told me in an e-mail that several recent Turley graduates founded Muddy Paws, a “very successful” dog-grooming enterprise, and that others are employed in hotel management. Still, work-release programs have a troubled history. The institution recalls the convict-lease system that arose in the South during Reconstruction and lasted until the Second World War. According to Douglas Blackmon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Slavery by Another Name” (a book banned from an Alabama prison not long ago for being “incendiary”), thousands of debtors, most of them black, were sent to “work off” court fines for a host of petty crimes, like vagrancy, gambling, or “selling cotton after sunset”—leased out to private companies as free or cheap labor for coal mines, lumberyards, and railroads. Melissa Poore, with two of her children, is one of several women who say they suffered “outrageous” abuse at a for-profit halfway house. Modern work-release programs have undergone a major transformation since then. At best, they can help cut incarceration costs while easing the transition from prison to employment. Although Oklahoma law stipulates that “work release placement is not a voluntary program,” participants are entitled to any wages that might be left from their jobs at fast-food shops and thrift stores after fines, fees, taxes, and incarceration costs are subtracted. Even so, some former residents of Avalon facilities claim that the program was run recklessly, putting both offenders and the public at risk. In the town of Muskogee, I met with a quiet, lumbering man named Fred Oliver, who lost part of his left hand while working on a maintenance crew at a municipal golf course, in an Avalon work-release program. He threatened to sue Avalon, charging a lack of safety gear provided on the site; his lawyer claimed that a private company had been contracted to maintain the grounds and improperly profited from the labor of offenders like Oliver—work-release participants who say that they were rarely, if ever, paid. (Oliver settled with the maintenance company for an undisclosed amount.) At Avalon’s Turley facility, women have raised a very different kind of safety complaint. According to a lawsuit filed last August—which began as Jane Does 1-50 v. Avalon Correctional Services, Inc.—a group of Turley residents sent to work-release jobs at a Quiznos sandwich shop in south Tulsa were subjected to “outrageous” forms of abuse. A male manager who lived at the back of the shop allegedly told his “Turley girls” that if they didn’t submit to his advances he could have them sent back to prison. A former Turley staff member told me that the man gave these women the freedom to do as they wanted (go off during the day, use his car, use drugs), as long as they would give him sexual favors; he would grope and harass those who wouldn’t coöperate. When she notified the chief administrator, she said, Turley stopped sending residents to the Quiznos shop for a while. Options for employment were limited, however, and before long placements there started again, she recalls. (“But you know what he’s doing to those women!” the staffer says she protested. She believes that the decision was financially motivated.) One afternoon last winter, I drove three hours south from Tulsa along the Indian Nation Turnpike, crossing the Muddy Boggy Creek to meet Melissa Poore, a thirty-four-year-old mother of four and one of the lawsuit’s Jane Does. Poore had agreed to sit down with me at her ex-boyfriend’s home in Boswell (population: 709). The route offered long stretches of squat, dense forest and golden grasses, and the few outposts that dotted the way all seemed to bear the names of locals: Linda’s Beauty Shop, Kirk’s Gun Repair, McCann’s Feed. When I reached the address that Poore had given me, a one-story brick-and-plank house at the end of a dirt road, she hurried out to greet me. A member of the Choctaw Nation, she had clear green eyes, steep cheekbones, and long straight hair. It was easy to imagine why the Quiznos manager might have picked Poore for his shop, if reports about his preference for hiring only “the prettiest Turley girls” held any truth. Former Turley residents I interviewed told me that his hiring practices were notorious. Mazie Grant, one of Turley’s older residents, recalls women being dismissed for having gray hair or for being “too dark.” Sitting on a living-room couch beneath a mounted collection of black porcelain angels, her eyes on her lap, Poore described a pattern of drug abuse that began in early adolescence. Meth addiction landed her in prison in 2011; a year later, she arrived at Turley for a work-release program. Her first job was making sandwiches at Quiznos. Sometimes, she said, she stayed overnight, at her supervisor’s request, helping him to restock food supplies. “I wound up relapsing after he put his hands on me,” she told me, recounting how her supervisor would grab her breasts, making remarks like “I want to suck your juices.” When she and other Turley women at the shop threatened to complain, he smirked. “His famous line was ‘You’re just a felon, no one’s going to believe you anyway,’ ” she told me. After he busted her lip and tore out her earring while demanding sexual favors, she complained to Avalon administrators, but, she says, “The chief of security just kind of laughed about it, really—I still got sent back to work the next day.” Poore says she decided to use her cell phone to record audio of her supervisor’s sexual impropriety, so that she would have evidence to back up her wish to change jobs. When he caught her, she alleges, he flew into a rage, grabbing her from behind, ripping her shirt, and attacking her. (Internal Avalon documents confirm that her “shirt appeared to be torn and she had scratched [sic] on her right shoulder area,” although other possible causes were also suggested; when the supervisor was asked later that week for security footage from Quiznos that would have recorded the incident, he claimed that “someone had stole the recording.”) On the afternoon of the alleged assault, Poore fled, and the Quiznos supervisor alerted Avalon’s administrator, who notified the police; the supervisor claimed that he had fired Poore several days earlier, suspecting that she had stolen checks. Although Poore caught a bus back to Turley within a few hours, she was charged with felonious escape, and sent back to prison—solitary confinement for the first month—to serve out the rest of her sentence. Not long after, another Turley resident claimed that the same manager had sexually assaulted her on the job. According to an internal Avalon report, “She alleges that while employed on occasion he would rub his body against her body . . . and also alleges that he has inappropriately touched her buttocks. . . . She reported that she was uncomfortable with her working conditions to the Chief of Security of Turley but was advised to continue her work day to avoid a misconduct, and she complied until a friend helped her gain employment at Subway.” I spoke with a third former Turley resident, who described having sex with the Quiznos supervisor for the privileges it afforded: if she coöperated sexually, he would let her take his credit card to buy “makeup, cigarettes, whatever I needed,” and allow her to visit with her infant son. “It’s disgusting, but I did it,” she said, noting that she “took advantage” of what had seemed at first like an opportunity, relapsing into meth use and funnelling drugs back into Turley. Poore had hoped that Turley would provide a path back to sobriety and steady work. Instead, she told me, between the sexual coercion at Quiznos and the prevalence of drugs at the facility, it encouraged relapse. There was “corruption everywhere” among low-wage guards, she said, which led to residents stealing jeans and perfume while working in stores in exchange for favors from staff. “I’ve always kept quiet about everything,” she said. But what happened at Quiznos broke something in her, Poore told me, and last August she joined the lawsuit against Avalon. The suit claims that a significant number of residents at the Turley Residential Center faced “sexual abuse and sex-based manipulation” at the sandwich shop. It also claims that Avalon’s staff “continually disregarded the complaints despite receiving multiple reports from different women about the same employer . . . and continued to send women to this same employer despite knowledge that women had repeatedly complained of sexual abuse.” Police investigated the Quiznos supervisor, but the District Attorney’s office declined to file charges and the supervisor appears to have fled town. The shop is now closed. But I was able to speak with Abbas Ghanei, a Quiznos franchise owner who had originally brought in the supervisor. “Everyone is innocent until they are proven guilty,” Ghanei said. Of the former Turley residents’ claims, he added, “They are halfway-house girls. They are always full of surprises and excuses. They’re the ones who broke the law, anyway.” Avalon calls the sexual-abuse lawsuit baseless and has sought to have it dismissed, in part on the ground that Oklahoma law bars suits against private corrections companies based solely on mental or emotional injuries. Several months before the allegations, Poore’s case manager noted, “Client . . . states that she really enjoy her job. Nothing further to report.” Two months before the purported escape, the same caseworker wrote, “She do not in any way feel like she is being sexually harassed.” According to Spencer Bryan and Logan Jones, attorneys who represent the Jane Does, other women have come forward with stories of harassment or abuse since they filed the suit. (Internal company documents also reflect reports of “inappropriate staff/offender relationships,” including nightly sexual liaisons between a Turley officer and an offender.) A decade ago, Bryan worked as a corporate lawyer for private prisons. In the years since, he has changed sides. He has come to believe that the for-profit halfway-house industry—at least, when it’s poorly regulated, as he considers it to be in Oklahoma—has “encouraged practices that maximized profits at the expense of the offender population.” The Jane Does’ suit proved to be just one in a series with a common claim: that lax oversight and perverse profit incentives have kept Avalon from supporting the rehabilitation of its offenders, or even, at times, from protecting their lives. Tamico Norton, a plump-cheeked thirty-six-year-old, came to the Turley Residential Center in May of 2013. Almost immediately upon waking on the day after her arrival, she fell ill. “She said, ‘Mama, I’m not feeling so good,’ ” her mother, Monica Norton, recalls of their last conversation, which took place on Turley’s pay phone. Monica urged her to rest. By the next day, Norton lay in a coma at St. John Medical Center, setting in motion yet another civil-rights lawsuit against Avalon. Norton’s symptoms started with pains in her stomach, which quickly spread to her chest and throat. By 2:25 p.m., according to a formal incident report first obtained by the Tulsa World reporter Cary Aspinwall, who broke news of the suit and related developments, “Offender Norton could not walk under her own strength and began vomiting, yelling, and screaming.” Instead of seeking medical help, the staff allegedly issued a scolding, assuming that she was high. Norton was ordered to sit in the “hot seat,” a prominent chair at the building’s security post generally reserved, residents say, for petty humiliation. (A shift supervisor claimed that Norton was put there for observation and to be tested for drugs; at the time, tennis balls stuffed with K2 routinely soared over the facility’s fence, and staff suspected that Norton might be on the drug.) “Is she O.K.?” several Turley residents recall asking in alarm, as Norton grasped at her throat and chest. She urinated in her pants and slumped lower in the chair. By 4 p.m., a supervisor noted that she “did not appear to have movement on the right side of her body.” Norton spent more than five hours slumped in the hot seat before she was taken to the hospital. (“As soon as it became apparent that she might need medical attention, we immediately called 911,” Brian Costello wrote in an e-mail.) The medical diagnosis was a blood clot in the brain. The next evening, she was declared dead. An autopsy was never performed, but Avalon’s own testing found that she was “negative for any illegal drug usage.” Her family has filed a wrongful-death suit. Their attorney, Anthony Allen, said that the death exemplified a “medieval” disregard for Turley residents’ welfare. The pending suits against Avalon piled up. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages could be at stake, and many millions more in government contracts. The litigation appears to have spurred other forms of unwanted attention. In January, corrections authorities acknowledged that the F.B.I. was investigating Avalon’s alleged misconduct at its Tulsa work-release facility for men. In late March, not long after the emergency closure of the Tulsa halfway house, the Department of Corrections ordered a surprise drug test at the company’s largest facility in the state, the Carver Transitional Center, in Oklahoma City. More than fifty per cent of the company’s residents tested positive. Although local news outlets, including the Oklahoman, the World, and Oklahoma Watch, doggedly covered each new development, the company proved quick to rebound, and reopened its Tulsa men’s facility in April, following a series of changes. Justin Jones, who resigned as the head of Oklahoma’s Department of Corrections last year, told me that he had repeatedly advised state legislators, some of whom took sizable campaign contributions from Avalon, about the recidivism rate of residents of private-sector halfway houses. In a March, 2013, letter to State Senator Clark Jolley, he reported that the rate at which offenders were returned to higher-security facilities from Avalon’s Carver Center—often for infractions like escapes and drug use—was nearly quadruple that of the state-run community-corrections facilities. In Jones’s view, the private halfway-house industry lacks incentives to succeed at rehabilitation. “If they are for-profit, and especially if they are publicly traded, they have to answer to shareholders,” he noted, which may come at the expense of treatment and other priorities. Yet the fact that some halfway houses may be managed poorly doesn’t mean that the hopes that nineteenth-century reformers had for the institutions are unattainable. “Good halfway houses will understand that leaving prison and trying to adjust to the outside world can be a very rocky transition,” Nancy La Vigne, the director of the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center, says. “The good halfway houses are the ones that have wraparound services to help people deal with the lack of job skills, substance-abuse problems, and other issues in a way that’s supportive.” In 2013, a Pennsylvania study concluded that inmates released to halfway houses across the state had worse recidivism rates than their counterparts who were sent directly back into society. In congressional testimony, La Vigne cited research showing that “the type and quality of programs” at a halfway house can mean the difference between an institution that makes communities safer and one that raises recidivism rates and fails to treat addictions. Across the country, experiments in prison alternatives are proliferating, many with evident success. In Brooklyn, an ambitious new program called JusticeHome, launched last year, allows a small number of mothers who plead guilty to felonies to stay at home with their families, receiving parenting training, G.E.D. classes, and other resources at a tenth the cost of sending the women to prison. The program is supported by data that show how such investments help to break patterns of imprisonment and reduce the chance that the children of offenders will end up in foster care. Oklahoma, too, has its success stories. While in Tulsa, I attended a graduation ceremony for Women in Recovery, a pioneering outpatient-treatment program launched, in 2009, with funding from the George Kaiser Family Foundation. The program offers intensive addiction treatment to women in lieu of long prison terms, with the goal of disrupting the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Oklahoma has the highest female incarceration rate in the country, and nearly thirty per cent of female inmates in the state have parents who did time. Participants generally enter Women in Recovery on nonviolent charges tied to the state’s substance-abuse plagues—crystal meth, crack cocaine, prescription drugs. If they complete the requirements, their sentences are deferred or suspended. The program is situated on the second floor of Tulsa’s Family and Children’s Services building, and has four pastel rooms for addiction treatment and trauma counselling; a bustling employment lab; and a parental-coaching room filled with plastic tea sets and Tinkertoys. (The coaching room has a two-way mirror, so that when a mother reunites with her kids an observing therapist can offer tips through a bug in her ear.) On the morning of graduation, families made their way across an icy lot toward the sleek Aloft Hotel in downtown Tulsa. The lobby smelled of brownies and fruit; the graduates, trained in a culinary-arts course offered in Women in Recovery’s kitchen, had assembled box lunches for some three hundred attendees. The women lived in semi-independent housing, and all were graduating with jobs—mostly service positions at hotels and chain stores like Panera or Bath & Body Works, but also some higher-skilled jobs, like welding and electrical work—that might help pay off whatever court costs and penalties they owe. Those costs can be substantial: in Oklahoma, strict mandatory sentences are often combined with steep statutory fines, in the tens of thousands of dollars. The hotel auditorium buzzed as the graduates took the stage in groups of three. Duelling photos were projected onto a screen as each woman stepped to the microphone: on the left, a recent mug shot, some red-eyed and ratty-haired, and, on the right, a program portrait bathed in prairie light. The graduates knew that they had been lucky to land where they did. “I started using meth when I was fourteen,” a woman named Sarah told the crowd. “I was in a high-speed chase, hit a tree, and learned that I was pregnant at the hospital.” Her arrest didn’t bring panic so much as relief, she explained: she could finally stop running. Being admitted to Women in Recovery meant that she wouldn’t have to give birth in a prison or a jail. (More than sixty per cent of women in the program were abused as kids; more than a third have been sexually assaulted; and most fled home or foster care in their teens.) “I’m sixty-two years old, and I’ve spent eighteen years in prison, forty-five years in my addiction,” another graduate, Diane Boyd, said. For the first time in nearly half a century, Boyd went on, she had a system in place to stay clean. “It may be cheaper to move people out of prison, but that has to be the beginning, and not the end, of the conversation,” Amy Lerman, a Berkeley political scientist and the co-author of a new book about crime and citizenship, says. “There’s a really big set of questions that we don’t have good answers to.” Halfway houses and private probation are both under-researched and poorly understood, in her view. The alternatives-to-incarceration industry “isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so we need to be thinking about what kind of role private companies play.” If a national debate about the future of halfway houses is starting to arrive at the legislative level—in part owing to revelations of abuse and negligence in recent years, which, as of March, have spurred new regulations of federal facilities—the private-probation industry can expect some scrutiny as well. Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama held a hearing to address the claims of three plaintiffs with cases similar to Harriet Cleveland’s: all had been unable to pay court costs and private-probation fees associated with traffic tickets, and all three had been jailed by the city of Montgomery as a result. The judge made a preliminary ruling in the debtors’ favor—he issued an injunction banning the city from “collecting or attempting to collect all outstanding fines, fees, costs, surcharges, or the outstanding balance of any monies owed to the City or to Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (‘JCS’) associated with traffic tickets.” He also wrote that the plaintiffs “have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the Defendant City of Montgomery (‘the City’) violated their Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights.” He asked the city to submit a plan detailing how it intends to assess a debtor’s ability to pay, and what alternatives to jail, such as community service, it will provide the indigent. At a hearing on June 30th, the judge is expected to make a ruling about how Montgomery will be allowed to collect court debts, including its use of J.C.S. In the meantime, a habeas petition filed by the attorney Sara Zampierin and her team got Harriet Cleveland freed from jail, and the process of discovery in her suit against the court yielded some surprises. It turned out that Cleveland had actually paid one of the tickets that had landed her in jail; sloppy accounting is commonplace in understaffed courts. What’s more, J.C.S. officers had sometimes placed Cleveland’s payments directly into its corporate accounts, with hardly anything applied toward her actual court costs. According to internal company records, Cleveland once made a two-hundred-dollar payment that went straight to J.C.S. Although suits like Cleveland’s are humble in scope, they have implications for the hundreds of thousands of defendants who appear each year before municipal courts tied to private-probation firms. Zampierin is alleging violations of her client’s most basic rights—to counsel, to due process, and to equal protection. On our walk to the day-care center, Cleveland told me that our discussion of her time “on the program”—she still spoke of J.C.S. as if it were a cousin of Weight Watchers—made her think of “Stone Fox,” a children’s book she’d picked up recently at work. It features a young Wyoming boy who lives with his grandfather, a potato farmer, until the old man falls behind on his property taxes and takes to his bed. The boy vows that he’ll save the farm from foreclosure. “He tried everything, but he just couldn’t pay,” she said as we walked our final quarter mile. Eventually, the boy enters a dog-sled race with his dog, seeking the cash prize. Suddenly, Cleveland began to weep. “That dog, it just ran and ran,” she said. “And then it ran its heart out.” In sight of the finish line, the dog collapses of exhaustion, dying on the snow. Cleveland took me to the jungle-themed reading room at the day-care center, where “Stone Fox” was on a shelf beneath a string of lights. She opened it to a sketch of a shadowy “tax man,” who had come to collect from the reed-thin farm boy half his size. “ ‘I’m warning you, if you don’t pay, we have our ways,’ the man said, derringer on his hip. ‘And it’s all legal. All fair and legal.’  ” A district-court judge will soon issue a decision about whether Cleveland’s own treatment has been fair and legal. Cleveland says she prays that her case in Montgomery will be successful, if only because she has hardly anything left to hand over to the authorities. “You can’t squeeze blood from a turnip,” she told me. When we spoke one recent afternoon before her day-care shift, Cleveland still had “Stone Fox” on her mind, so I bought a copy. The tale of the boy’s attempt to hold on to his grandfather’s potato fields turned out to be every bit as grim as she had recounted. In the book’s final chapter, the boy manages to carry his dog’s carcass across the finish line, helped along by a fellow-racer, thus winning the cash that will ultimately save the family farm. Harriet Cleveland prays most nights for a simpler twist—maybe divine intervention, or some cash tucked under a sidewalk flagstone, or, better yet, a full-time job at one of the twenty local businesses where she has left her freshly typed résumé in an attempt to keep her small pink house. “I know it’s raggedy,” she told me. “But at least it’s mine.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Obamacare: Where Are We Now?,9566,"With Monday’s deadline for enrollment in 2014 approaching, Obamacare—sorry, former Speaker Pelosi, but that’s what it’s come to be known as—presents something of a paradox. After the disastrous problems early on with the federal online insurance market, HealthCare.gov, the sign-up process has gone much better than could have been expected a few months ago. But opinion polls show that a majority of Americans still oppose the health-care law. And many Democrats fear that, come November, it could cost them the Senate. What is going on? First, the numbers. According to the latest figures from the White House, more than six million people have signed up for private insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act. Another three or four million low-income families have enrolled in the expanded Medicaid program, and, under a provision of the law introduced in 2010, about the same number of young people have been added to their parents’ private insurance plans. By the Monday deadline, the figures will likely be higher. On Thursday, 1.5 million people visited HealthCare.gov, and more than four hundred thousand people placed calls to the insurance exchange, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a tweet. Of course, these figures can be parsed in numerous ways. A good number of the enrollees, perhaps fifteen or twenty per cent, haven’t paid their first monthly premiums yet, and we can’t be absolutely sure that they will. The churn rate—the proportion of people who drop out after a few months—hasn’t been published. Among those signing up, we don’t know what the final age distribution will be. (In the three months to the end of March, seventy per cent of the enrollees were thirty-five or older, which is more than the government was hoping for.) We don’t know how many of the enrollees were previously uninsured and how many were switching plans—either voluntarily or because their old ones were cancelled. Despite these qualifications, though, the underlying message is a positive one. Lots of Americans who previously couldn’t obtain insurance, either because they couldn’t afford it or because insurers wouldn’t offer it to them, now have health coverage. Despite all the negative publicity surrounding HealthCare.gov’s launch, despite all the attacks by Republicans and other opponents of the law, despite all the carve-outs and delayed deadlines imposed by an anxious White House, Obamacare is up and running. Contrary to the predictions of doom, it hasn’t collapsed under the weight of its own complications. As was the case with the Massachusetts reform on which it was largely based, it will take a couple of years, or even longer, before we can really judge how the new system is working. Because each state is its own insurance market, the outcomes will differ widely across the country. In big Democrat-run states that are running their own insurance exchanges, such as California and New York, and in states like Illinois and Michigan that are operating exchanges in partnership with the federal government, the prognosis is pretty good. Large numbers of people are signing up, and there’s quite a bit of competition among insurers. Over time, as people become increasingly familiar with the system, enrollments are likely to ramp up further, which is what the designers of the plan envisaged. In hard-line Republican states such as Texas and Louisiana, which have leaders who are implacably opposed to the law, the outlook is much less favorable. Enrollment rates on HealthCare.gov are much lower than elsewhere, which isn’t surprising given that some of these states, in a blatant effort to thwart the reform, have placed strict restrictions on who can serve as counsellors to guide people through the enrollment process. And low-income families in these states, since their governors have refused to coöperate with the reform, are denied the option of signing up for the expanded Medicaid program. In areas like these, there is a possibility of a negative spiral, with low rates of enrollment prompting insurers to raise rates, which, in turn, dissuades more people from enrolling. An objective reading of this record would be that Obamacare, after a horrible foul-up in rolling out HealthCare.gov, has made a good deal of progress, and some of its problems are the consequence of deliberate efforts to undermine it. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Since the government is effectively handing out money to families of modest means—figures from the Department of Health and Human Services show that about four in five of the enrollees are eligible for a federal subsidy—it is perhaps not so surprising that the sign-up figures have jumped sharply over the past few weeks. After months of bad news, it’s still something for the Obama Administration, and all supporters of health-care reform, to cheer. So far, though, this turnaround isn’t really reflected in the opinion polls. As the glitches on HealthCare.gov have been fixed, the level of opposition to the reform has fallen back from the levels it reached in November and December: that was only to be expected. Taking a longer view, though, the striking thing is how little public attitudes have changed. The results in individual polls bounce around a bit, and there are some shocking outliers. On Friday, for instance, a new survey from AP-GfK suggested that just twenty-six per cent of Americans support the health-care reforms. But the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, which averages the individual surveys, shows a remarkable degree of stability. On December 15, 2009, about three months before Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, 52.7 per cent of poll respondents opposed it, and 37.8 per cent supported it. On March 25, 2014, 53.2 per cent opposed it, and 39.8 per cent supported it. These figures are discouraging for supporters of the reform. And yet Americans’ views of the A.C.A. aren’t as monolithic as they might appear. For one thing, the polls show consistently that most people favor keeping the reform and amending it, rather than repealing it, which is still the Republican position. That explains why, this week, six moderate Democrats who are up for election in November announced their intention to modify the A.C.A. in various ways. Even more striking, many of the individual elements of the reform are highly popular, and have been all along. The latest tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that eighty per cent of respondents are in favor of allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans; seventy-nine per cent favor eliminating the “doughnut hole” in Medicare’s prescription drugs plan; seventy-seven per cent favor providing subsidies to folks who can’t afford coverage; seventy-four per cent favor the expansion of Medicaid; and seventy per cent favor preventing insurance companies from dropping people with preëxisting conditions. The Medicare tax increase on upper-income households is less popular, but it still has majority support: fifty-six per cent. About the only aspect of the plan that evoked a negative reaction was the individual mandate, which just thirty-five per cent of respondents viewed favorably. Why, then, does the over-all reform remain so unpopular? Part of the answer is that it faces the same challenges as any other progressive program designed primarily to help a relatively small section of the population—in this case, the uninsured. Lots of people who don’t directly benefit, at least for the moment, because they already have insurance, don’t see much in it for them. But there is also a big communications problem, which still hasn’t been resolved. The Republicans, with the enthusiastic help of conservative media outlets, have done a fiendishly effective job of stigmatizing what is essentially a private-sector solution as a big-government intrusion, and a handout to the unworthy. Back to that poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. It suggests that one in three Americans believe that the A.C.A. established a “death panel” to make decisions about the end-of-life coverage that people receive under Medicare, and another one in four Americans aren’t sure whether such a panel exists. (It doesn’t.) On top of that, nearly half of Americans think that the A.C.A. allows undocumented immigrants to receive federal subsidies for the purchase of insurance on the new exchanges. This despite the fact that the law explicitly denies subsidies to the undocumented, and even bars them from purchasing plans through the exchanges at full cost. A couple of weeks ago, I suggested that it was time for more Democrats to abandon their caution and embrace Obamacare as a historic reform that makes health care more accessible and affordable. A good way to start would be by making more effort to dispel some of the damaging myths that still surround the program. Photograph by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty.

"A Gay-Rights Ruling in Texas, A Veto in Arizona",6883,"“Holmes honorably served our nation for nearly twenty-three years and retired as a Major at the end of 2010,” Judge Orlando Garcia, of the Western District of Texas, wrote in an order, issued Thursday, finding the state’s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Victor Holmes and Mark Phariss brought the case after they had been denied a marriage license because they were both men. Cleopatra de Leon—“a United States Air Force veteran,” Garcia noted, “honorably discharged after ten years of service”—and Nicole Dimetman, their fellow plaintiffs, were asking Texas to recognize their marriage, which took place in Massachusetts. Garcia’s ruling did not rely on their status as veterans; the Fourteenth Amendment and a Supreme Court ruling last summer were what mattered. And yet their service is part of the story—of their lives, but also of a larger fight for marriage equality and, more simply, equality. What does it mean to treat a citizen honorably? That question had been headed for an ignominious answer in Arizona, where the state legislature passed a bill its supporters bragged would allow businesses to turn away same-sex couples. This is supposedly in the name of religious freedom. Jan Brewer, the governor, vetoed the bill Wednesday night, something even Republicans like Mitt Romney and John McCain had urged her to do. The language was so broad that it could have turned an assertion of religiosity into an all-purpose defense for the firing or unfair treatment of all sorts of people, not only gays and lesbians (although that would be bad enough)—a civil stand-your-discriminatory-ground law. The legal theory is tied up with cases like Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby, in which a private, for-profit company is trying to get an exemption from Obamacare’s contraception-coverage mandate on religious grounds. But the Arizona law had no pretense about its homophobia. The real wonder is that it took several days for Brewer to decide to veto it. If Arizona had adopted its discrimination law, it would have found itself increasingly lonely. (The N.F.L. might even have moved the Super Bowl.) Judge Garcia stayed his ruling pending an appeal, meaning that Holmes and Phariss, and others in Texas, can’t get married just yet. There will be more cases soon. Federal courts in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Utah have all also found their states’ same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional (though those rulings have also been stayed). Those victories owe much to Edith Windsor, the widow who brought the case that led the Supreme Court to throw out the provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act prohibiting the federal government from recognizing state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. It did not recognize a broader right to same-sex marriage but, as has become increasingly clear, it laid out the legal building blocks for such a case. Garcia, in effect, argued that the state ban was a mini-doma: “The lower courts must apply the Supreme Court’s decision in Windsor and decide whether a state can do what the federal government cannot: discriminate against same-sex couples.” There will likely be more such rulings, and more states that find other ways to legalize same-sex weddings, either through referendum or legislation. How many depends on how long it takes for the Supreme Court to rule on a fifty-state right to marriage equality. A word that appeared several times in Judge Garcia’s ruling was “dignity.” “By denying Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss the fundamental right to marry, Texas denies their relationship the same status and dignity afforded to citizens who are permitted to marry. It also denies them the legal, social, and financial benefits of marriage that opposite-sex couples enjoy.” The laws, he continued, “demean their dignity for no legitimate reason.” Garcia also wrote about the “needless stigmatization and humiliation for children being raised by the loving same-sex couples being targeted”—an example of how the argument that same-sex marriage needs to be stopped for the sake of the children has been turned on its head: if you believe that it is helpful for children to have parents who are married, then you should support same-sex marriage. And, again, he looked at the situation of gays and lesbians in uniform: In an August 30, 2013 letter to military personnel at state-run installations, Texas Military Forces were directed to deny same-sex couples enrollment access to federal healthcare and retirement benefits at Texas-based National Guard facilities. Instead, these service members and their families must travel to federal installations elsewhere in the state to enroll and obtain access to standard military benefits. In response, United States Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, reprimanded Texas and the Texas National Guard for failing to grant full spousal benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian members of the armed forces. In other words, if Texas makes it harder for a soldier’s spouse to get the benefits he or she deserves, the state should be ashamed. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? It won’t be lost on anyone reading the decision now that, when Holmes and de Leon were in the military, they were at constant risk of being discharged because of whom they loved. Someone going through it in a few years might have to be reminded. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was only repealed in 2010; the shock to the military turned out to be how quietly it went. Forcing troops to lie about who they were turns out to have been a far greater stress on the armed forces than letting them be honest. More important than the number of years of military service Garcia catalogued, in reviewing the facts of the case, were the nearly seventeen years that Holmes and Phariss have been together (“They celebrate August 9 as their anniversary”), the twelve years for de Leon and Dimetman. They became parents in 2012. “There is no dispute that Plaintiffs are loving couples in long-term committed relationships,” Garcia found. And so why shouldn’t they get married? People like weddings—their own, their neighbors’, their cousin’s in Arizona. When you recognize that people are full citizens, all sorts of pieces fall into place. Most people like the idea of living honestly, as hard as it can be to get right. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast.

Why Did the F.D.A. Approve a New Pain Drug?,10967,"In late October, the Food and Drug Administration made the front page of the Times by announcing that it would recommend moving drugs like Vicodin, which combine hydrocodone with over-the-counter painkillers, to the restrictive Schedule II class of drugs. That would make it harder for people to access them: if all goes according to plan, patients could no longer receive automatic refills, nor could doctors phone in prescriptions. It was seen as a landmark decision. Hydrocodone, when combined with ingredients like acetaminophen or aspirin, is the most commonly prescribed painkiller in the United States, with about a hundred and thirty-one million prescriptions dispensed in 2011, but it is also an opioid analgesic, a type of drug that is highly addictive and can be dangerous. From 1999 to 2010, the number of deaths involving opioid analgesics more than quadrupled, to nearly seventeen thousand, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid treatment can help treat some kinds of pain—for instance, short-term pain from an operation or from cancer. But researchers have been raising questions about whether opioid analgesics work all that well to manage the pain from chronic conditions, like osteoarthritis, in the long term. Some evidence has suggested that long-term use of opioids may even increase sensitivity to pain rather than reducing it. The same day the Times article ran, there came another announcement from the F.D.A.: it had approved, for Schedule II, a new opioid analgesic called Zohydro ER, despite a recommendation against the drug’s approval by an F.D.A. advisory committee. The medication, an extended-release painkiller developed by a California-based company called Zogenix, is made of pure hydrocodone and uses a higher dosage scale than hydrocodone-combination drugs like Vicodin. Unlike those drugs, Zohydro ER does not include acetaminophen or aspirin, which can cause liver damage if abused over a long period. But Zohydro ER will come in capsules—a form particularly prone to abuse—and is every bit as potent and addictive as other opioids. And there is no version of Zohydro ER meant to keep people from crushing or chewing the drug, though Zogenix is working with Altus Formulation, of Montreal, to craft an abuse-deterrent version. Zogenix proposed that Zohydro ER be approved to manage “moderate-to-severe chronic pain in cases in which a continuous, around-the-clock opioid is needed,” for twelve hours a day and months at a time—in other words, to deal with persistent and long-term pain, such as back pain, that shorter-acting opioids don’t cover as well. But given the concerns about abuse of painkillers and evidence of the complications that can result over the course of long-term treatments, how did Zohydro make it through the approval process? Zogenix began extensive clinical trials in March of 2010, on patients with back pain. The outcomes of the twelve-week-long efficacy trials, submitted with Zogenix’s new drug application in May of 2012, showed that Zohydro ER had reduced patients’ discomfort more than a placebo. The side effects weren’t any worse than other drugs in the same class. In its application, Zogenix mentioned the F.D.A.’s earlier findings of “safety and efficacy” for Vicoprofen, which is, practically speaking, about as strong as Vicodin. Zogenix complied with the agency’s other requirements, too, providing hundreds of pages describing the outcomes of clinical trials and pharmacological analysis and submitting details about its proposed labelling for the product. In December of 2012, the F.D.A. assembled a paid advisory committee of opioid experts in Silver Spring, Maryland, to consider the pros and cons of allowing Zohydro ER to enter the market. At the meeting, Zogenix argued that because acetaminophen becomes toxic to the liver at higher doses, drugs like Vicodin were not safe for patients who needed long-term treatment. The company also made the case that Zohydro ER would be better controlled than its unruly predecessors, thanks to new F.D.A. requirements. Drug manufacturers now have to educate health-care providers about how to appropriately use high-risk medications. They also must carefully monitor the drug for signs of trending abuse or misuse. Interspersed with Zogenix’s explanations were expert panelists’ discussions of Zohydro ER’s shortcomings. Several scientists observed that the F.D.A. requires similar drugs to be formulated so that they cannot be readily crushed or chewed, and they balked at Zohydro ER’s lack of an abuse-deterrent version. One drug expert wondered whether Oxycontin’s bad reputation had made it hard for physicians to prescribe the drug, opening the door for an alternative, like Zohydro, to replace it not only in patients’ medicine cabinets but also on the streets. Another panelist questioned whether the new F.D.A.-mandated program could meaningfully curb the potential for abuse and overdose. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Bob Rappaport, the director of the F.D.A’s Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products, observed at the meeting that it was reasonable to anticipate that a single-entity hydrocodone product “will contribute to the already critical public-health problem of prescription opioid abuse and misuse.” But he also chastised the expert panel for some of their more pointedly critical remarks about Zohydro ER, observing that they were “punishing this company and this drug because of the sins of the previous developers and their products” and that “from a regulatory standpoint, that’s not something we can do.” He explained that as long as the drug met F.D.A. requirements, it ought to pass muster; Zohydro ER could not be scapegoated simply by virtue of being an opioid. “We are obligated at the agency to operate within the regulatory framework,” he said, “and that includes providing a level playing field for industry. We don’t have a choice by that. It’s the law.” Indeed, a company that wants to market a new drug must test it and submit evidence to the F.D.A. that the product is as safe and effective as another drug in the same class that has already been approved. Also, the drug’s health benefits are supposed to outweigh known risks. And the company must show that there is no new “signal” that the drug presents a health risk above and beyond the general problems endemic to its entire drug class—in the case of Zohydro ER, the Schedule II class of opioid analgesic drugs. In other words, to be approved, a drug does not have to be better than drugs that have been approved in the past. It just can’t be worse. If the drug fails to meet these qualifications, the F.D.A. can take regulatory actions—for instance, requiring more tests or better labelling—or it can simply decide not to approve the application. But what if the new drug has a problem that is known to exist throughout the entire drug class—for instance, the high propensity for abuse, misuse, and addiction that are common to all opioids? In that case, the F.D.A. cannot simply refuse to approve the new drug. The reasoning behind this is sound enough: refusing to approve Zohydro ER because it is a dangerous opioid would require revisiting the approvals of all other opioids on the market. That would be expensive and time-consuming for the F.D.A. and pharmaceutical companies. It would also likely be unproductive, because previous efforts to limit access to these drugs have met with resistance from groups—some funded by the pharmaceutical industry—that point out, reasonably, that adults with chronic pain deserve to have their suffering mitigated as much as possible. And yet, isn’t there something problematic about a system in which a new drug can be pinpointed as prone to abuse—but can pass muster because other drugs, equally hazardous, were approved? Andrew Kolodny, a physician who has fought for stronger restrictions on pain-pill prescriptions, attended the December meeting as a member of the public and spoke up during a period reserved for comments. “One has to wonder how many more pain patients have to be harmed, how many more people have to become addicted, how many more lives will have to be lost,” he said, “before the F.D.A. finally begins to exercise its authority and responsibility to prohibit drug companies from marketing opioids as if they have been proven safe and effective for long-term use.” The advisory committee voted 11–2, with one abstention, to recommend that the agency refuse to approve Zohydro ER’s new drug application, because of concerns about the risk of misuse and abuse and the resulting potential impact on public health. The F.D.A., in its approval of Zohydro ER, said “that the benefits of this product outweigh the risks” and that hydrocodone has “abuse liability similar to other drugs [in] its class.” Zohydro ER will enter the market in 2014, manufactured by an Ireland-based company called Alkermes. Zogenix will handle sales and marketing, as well as the F.D.A.-mandated tracking of escalating abuse or misuse. Morgan Liscinsky, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said that advisory meetings for new drug approvals happen often and that the F.D.A. is not obligated to follow advisory committees’ recommendations. But the F.D.A. often does follow the recommendations. As Ian Parker wrote in the current issue of the magazine, Merck is revising its application for approval of a new insomnia drug at the F.D.A.’s request, after a committee recommended that the drug not be approved at some of the higher dosage levels that Merck had sought in an earlier application. Kolodny had left the December meeting feeling that there wasn’t much chance that Zohydro ER would make it to market following the committee’s strong vote against it. When he heard the news of its approval almost ten months later, while driving through Delaware, he felt deflated. The previous day, he had celebrated the F.D.A.’s decision to tighten restrictions for hydrocodone-combination products with a dinner and a cocktail at P. F. Chang’s. “Realizing that the benefits of up-scheduling combos were likely to outweigh the downsides of Zohydro ER’s approval made me feel a little better,” he said, “but it wasn’t a pleasant ride home.” Jillian Keenan provided additional reporting for this piece.

G.O.P. Succumbs to Rare Outbreak of Sanity,6888,"This post has been updated. There was a rare outbreak of sanity in the Grand Old Party on Tuesday, when Speaker John Boehner and a group of his allies joined with the Democrats to approve a raise in the debt ceiling without any preconditions, thereby avoiding the risk of the United States defaulting on its financial obligations. Never fear, though: the outbreak has been contained, and there doesn’t seem to be any danger of contagion. By Wednesday morning, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texan firebrand, appeared to threaten to filibuster a Senate vote on the debt ceiling, and the Tea Partiers, gold bugs, Randians, birthers, anti-government bootboys, and other assorted wing nuts that make up a big part of the party’s base were happily ranting on about Boehner’s perfidy. If there’s one thing your typical Republican activist likes more than berating President Obama and the Democrats it’s attacking traitors and yellowbellies in his (or her) own ranks, and, once again, the long-suffering Speaker of the House is the primary target. “It’s time for him to go,” Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, told the Times. Daniel Horowitz, a contributor to the conservative Web site Red State, agreed. “We’re being played like fools,” he wailed. Another contributor to the site, who goes by the username Gawken, seconded the call for a leadership election in the House Republican caucus, and he insisted that it should take place right away in order to avoid letting Boehner’s number two, Eric Cantor, build up enough support to replace him. “Taking Boehner out now would keep Cantor out of the Speaker’ office,” Gawken wrote. “He’s as bad as Boehner.” Now, dear reader, you may be suffering under the impression that Cantor, the House Majority Leader, is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, with hopelessly reactionary views on everything from taxation to abortion to Israel to flag burning. But that’s not how many G.O.P. activists see him. To these self-styled insurrectionaries, Cantor, Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, are all of a sort: opportunistic establishment sellouts who will betray the conservative cause at the first hint of displeasure from the corporate lobbyists and crony-capitalists that finance the party. With the activists even more enraged than usual, there is plenty of scope for rabble-rousing. Thus the sorry spectacle of Cruz stomping about and refusing to back an increase in the debt ceiling unless it receives sixty votes, which would require five Republicans breaking ranks and voting with the Democrats. “I think Republicans should stand together and do the right thing,” the Texan Joe McCarthy lookalike said on Tuesday. “We should have every Republican stand together and follow the responsible course of action, which is to insist on meaningful spending reforms before raising the debt ceiling.” Cruz is no dummy, occasional appearances suggesting otherwise notwithstanding. (He went to Harvard Law School, damn it!) He is perfectly aware that following the course of action he himself is advocating would be potentially disastrous for the Republicans, who currently stand a good chance of regaining control of the Senate in this year’s midterms. Last fall, when the G.O.P. held firm on raising the debt ceiling, it led to a two-week government shutdown and a dive into single figures for Congress’s approval ratings. With this experience fresh in their minds, Boehner and his colleagues in the Republican leadership took the sensible decision to fold this time around, and concentrate their fire on Obamacare. It was, after all, the troubled rollout of the health-insurance exchanges that resurrected the G.O.P.’s hopes of sweeping the midterms. And, despite a surge in the number of people enrolling for plans, a new poll from Gallup suggests that a majority of Americans still disapprove of the health-care reforms. With election day less than nine months away, getting past the debt-ceiling fight was a no-brainer for the Republicans, even if that involved handing a short-term victory to President Obama. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? But Cruz, with his eyes on a possible Presidential bid in 2016—he’s visiting Iowa next month—faces a different set of incentives. In the endless foment that constitutes internal G.O.P. politics, the trick for the young and ambitious is to whip up support among the activists while not situating oneself permanently beyond the pale laid down by the money men and other party functionaries. And since it’s a competitive game, you sometimes have to make it look like you don’t care about trifling issues like avoiding debt defaults, alienating moderate voters, and winning midterm elections. Cruz is playing this game, which has helped the G.O.P. to lose four of the past six Presidential elections. So is Senator Marco Rubio, who last summer said that he wouldn’t vote for a debt-ceiling increase unless the Democrats agree to a ten-year deficit-reduction plan. And so is Congressman Paul Ryan, who voted against the debt-ceiling increase in Tuesday’s vote in the House. Rand Paul, with his campaign to bring back Monica Lewinsky, is another participant, but he may not actually consider it a game; it’s hard to tell. Either way, the crazed and self-destructive internal dynamics of the G.O.P. remain in place, a fact Boehner knows better than anybody. On his way of out of Tuesday’s press conference, during which he announced his cave-in, he was heard humming a Disney song. It went like this: “Zip-a-dee Doo Dah. Zip-a-dee-ay. My, oh, my, what a wonderful day. Plenty of sunshine heading my way.” He’s got a sense of humor, the chain-smoking Ohioan. Give him that. Update: On Thursday afternoon, the Senate passed the debt-ceiling legislation, defying Cruz’s efforts to bottle things up. The legislators voted sixty-seven to thirty-one to cut off debate and to go a vote. Twelve Republicans joined the democrats, including the Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and John Cornyn, the G.O.P. Whip. The chamber then passed the actual debt-ceiling measure, which raises the ceiling until March, 2015, by fifty-five votes to forty-three. The votes took place as a big snowstorm advanced on Washington. Photograph by Larry Downing/Reuters. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Whose Distressed Baby Is It?,10380,"How does one define “distressed”? Anxious, worried, upset in a slightly old-fashioned way, and somehow ragged. Damsels can be in distress, without being distressed ladies—blithely awaiting rescue, without a ribbon out of place. Fashionably scuffed dressers or jeans are said to be “gently distressed.” When the word is modified that way, it also calls to mind a baby, half woken up and wiggling, darting out a hand to see if someone is there. When Tim Armstrong, the C.E.O. of AOL, talked about “distressed babies” a few days ago, though, there was nothing gentle added, in either the language or the intent. He was explaining, in a conference call with employees, why the company was making their 401(k) plan worse. “In 2012,” he said, in a transcript that Capital New York got first, We had two AOL-ers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were OK in general. And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost. So when we had the final decision about what benefits to cut because of the increased healthcare costs, we made the decision, and I made the decision, to basically change the 401(k) plan. In other words, don’t blame us for cutting back on retirement benefits; it was two babies we had to keep alive who took your money. But what did Armstrong mean when he said “we paid a million dollars”? This does not represent an act of charity on the part of a struggling company. AOL is profitable, and just had a very good quarter; it has done well enough to pay Armstrong twelve million dollars, a number that does not seem to distress him. And, as Deanna Fei, the rightly distressed mother of one said baby, wrote in a piece for Slate, she and her husband, who works for AOL, had paid their premiums for the company’s health-insurance plan. This is what they bought, with that money and her husband’s labor: an agreement that, in the event that something bad happened with their health or that of their child, they would be able to go to the doctor, and that they wouldn’t be bankrupted. Something very bad did happen. Fei woke up with sudden pains when she was only five months pregnant with her second child. She was rushed to the hospital, and her baby girl was rescued with an emergency Caesarean section—one pound nine ounces, her skin all purple and blue the way no baby’s should be. (One doctor, Fei said, was “visibly shaken.”) She was put on a ventilator. “That day, we were told that she had roughly a one-third chance of dying before we could bring her home. That she might not survive one month or one week or one day,” Fei wrote. For longer than I can bear to remember, we were too terrified to name her, to know her, to love her. In my lowest moments—when she suffered a brain hemorrhage, when her right lung collapsed, when she stopped breathing altogether one morning—I found myself wishing that I could simply mourn her loss and go home to take care of my strapping, exuberant, fat-cheeked son. Except that the baby girl wouldn’t give up: “over the next weeks, she fought for every minute of her young life, as did her doctors and nurses, and we could only strive to do the same.” She was in distress, that baby, but she wasn’t going to wait like some damsel. Fei doesn’t doubt that all of this—“blood transfusions, head ultrasounds, the insertion of breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and a central line extending nearly to her heart”—could have cost a million dollars. That is the point of insurance. AOL, which is apparently self-insured (while using Cigna as one of its plan administrators) made a bet that it wasn’t going to get the employees it needed without a decent health-care plan, and that this was the way to provide it. (It also, as some commentators have noted, appears not to have opted for a reinsurance policy as a hedge against big claims.) Armstrong also complained about Obamacare, which he said would cost the company millions; as Ezra Klein pointed out in a Bloomberg column, this suggests only that he and AOL haven’t looked closely at the law, and figured out how the company can now join a larger risk pool and protect itself from big swings. Or was his problem with Obamacare that it won’t let insurers tell people like Fei’s daughter that they’ve reached some “lifetime cap” before their first birthday, or keep her father looking for a job with a more sane employer because he’s worried that a “preëxisting condition” will keep her from finding a new insurer? But wasn’t this about 401(k)s—retirement plans—and not about health care? Armstrong’s rationale is really just a riff on how much higher profits would be if you didn’t have to hire human beings. As Fei wrote, Armstrong “exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting.” (She says she is doing so now because her husband starting getting queries from co-workers minutes after the conference call.) The change to the 401(k) plan was this: instead of matching contributions quarterly, the company would only pay its share for employees who were active on December 31st of a given year. If you were left or passed away or were fired on December 30th, you would get nothing, despite three hundred and sixty-four days as an AOL-er. With the “distressed baby” move, Armstrong removed the presumption that the company wouldn’t use this in bad faith. If someone complains to the entire company about how much trouble it is that a couple of babies were gravely sick, would you put it past him to fire employees who were about to be due a big contribution? Maybe in his next speech he’d be complaining about AOL-ers who had the temerity to die from heart attacks on New Year’s Day, instead of on Christmas. That speech won’t be given now; Armstrong’s speech was so blatantly oblivious, so cheap in every sense of the word, that he has had to apologize (after a false start, in which he said he’d just been trying to show how much he cared) and also reverse the 401(k) change. But we’re not done with this. There is more to be distressed about, on behalf of babies, parents, and the people who work with them. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? For one thing, Fei pushed back at Armstrong from what was, within the terms of our discussions about parenting, an unassailable position. Armstrong, in his first non-apology, had referred to her pregnancy as “high-risk”: But there was nothing high-risk about my pregnancy. I never had a single risk factor for a preterm birth, let alone one as extreme as this one. Until the morning I woke up in labor, every exam indicated that our daughter was perfectly healthy. Her first pregnancy had been “normal”; this one had appeared to be, too. She is absolutely right to remind Armstrong that life itself is riskily uncertain, and of the shallowness of acting as if we make our own luck entirely, picking our circumstances from a store shelf. But if there had been risk factors—so what? What if she had been older, or had her own health problems or struggles with infertility, or maybe even was single? What if she’d had a wife, rather than a husband? She should have just as much right in any of those circumstances not to be exposed and blamed, and for her baby to not be treated like a beggar. Armstrong might have assumed there was some such factor at work, and that he had more resentment to play with—including his own. One item that emerged this week was a 2005 workplace-discrimination suit against Google, with allegations against one of its executives, a certain Tim Armstrong, brought by a woman on his sales team with a high-risk pregnancy. She’d initially been carrying quadruplets; according to the suit, it was soon after she lost two of them that Armstrong called her an “H.R. nightmare” and badgered and maneuvered her out of her job; she lost a third a couple of weeks after he fired her over the phone. (Valleywag has an account of the suit; because of a clause in the woman’s agreement with Google, the case went to arbitration rather than to trial.) AOL and other tech companies—really, any firm that makes use of educated workers—relies on women who put off having children while they or their partners get graduate degrees or work. Maybe it doesn’t make sense to have a baby yet when you are working around the clock for a software company; maybe you can’t imagine paying for child care while you still have so many student loans, and want to be responsible. It often is possible to have children later, for some women easily so, but the numbers do undeniably get worse. (This message is the subject of a number of recent books, including one by my old friend Tanya Selvaratnam, “The Big Lie.”) We have an economy, culture, and workplace that push women and families in a certain direction, and then treat the higher risks they take on as theirs alone. Contempt replaces community. If Armstrong illustrates anything, it is the quickness with which a modern company can abandon those who reshaped their lives on its behalf, and made it rich. It’s not just the high-tech economy or older mothers or unconventional choices. Too many young women in this country don’t get proper prenatal care—increasing their risk—because of the insanity of our health-care system, or find that they are questioned for having a baby it’s said they can’t “afford.” A grown man on a corporate conference call whining about the burden of other people’s babies is simultaneously the most un-American and distinctly American scene one can imagine.

"American Health Care: Too Much, Too Late?",7913,"Last year, while doing book research in New Haven, Connecticut, we met a social worker who told us about a twenty-eight-year-old man with diabetes. He had been living in a vacant, boarded-up house; to avoid being seen there, he entered through the marshes behind the home. His shoes were full of holes, but he couldn’t afford to replace them. He also sometimes went several days without fresh food. As a result of his bad diet, he struggled to control his diabetes; after a lifetime of poor insulin control, he was starting to lose circulation in his feet. The man had recently got two toes removed from his right foot to save his life, an operation with a baseline cost of at least four thousand seven hundred dollars, and his feet were already badly infected. Several people at the hospital emphasized the importance of keeping his feet dry, getting proper nutrition, and regularly taking his costly insulin. He was eager to do all of this, and, indeed, he became diligent about taking his insulin. But, because of his living conditions and lack of employment, it was harder to follow the other recommendations. The social worker told us that the man would likely have to get more toes removed (at an additional cost of at least nine thousand four hundred dollars); without immediate changes, he would eventually need a below-the-knee amputation (another nine thousand four hundred dollars or more) and a wheelchair to get around (in excess of a thousand dollars, in many cases). If all of this happened, the estimated cost of this young man’s medical expenses would top twenty-four thousand dollars, paid for by a state medical-assistance program. A decent pair of shoes costs fifty dollars or less. Wouldn’t investing in shoes have been a better start? Two years ago, health spending in the United States accounted for nearly eighteen per cent of G.D.P., almost twice the average rate among countries that belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Yet the United States also has among the highest rates of obesity, diabetes, and cancer, and a below-average life expectancy, compared with other O.E.C.D. countries. Increasingly, research has indicated that there may be a paradoxical explanation for this discrepancy: the country is investing too much in medicine and not enough in addressing the social, behavioral, and environmental factors—things like diet and housing—that help create medical problems in the first place. Only about ten per cent of early deaths are related to medical care; thirty per cent come from genetics, and about sixty per cent are the result of social, environmental, and behavioral factors, according to a report by J. Michael McGinnis, Pamela Williams-Russo, and James R. Knickman. Meanwhile, the United States spends far more on health-care services than on social services. Some call this “medicalization”—that is, the treatment of social, economic, and behavioral factors as medical problems—and it is estimated to have accounted for nearly four per cent of total domestic spending on health care in 2005. There are several reasons why American health-care costs are so high compared to those abroad: patients are given more intense care, administrative spending is especially high, health services are more expensive, doctors have a financial incentive to suggest more treatment, and people with insurance aren’t held accountable for the high cost of their care. But what if we could reduce our reliance on medical care and direct more resources to the services that improve people’s health in the first place? Couldn’t that help lower over-all health spending while also making people healthier? We’re not the first to suggest this. The Affordable Care Act is set up so that, over time, health-care providers could be rewarded for achieving better health outcomes for patients rather than simply for providing more health-care services. (Some argue that insuring more people through Obamacare could drive up health-care costs, because it would encourage more patients and providers to spend unnecessarily on medicalization; we believe, however, that the health-care system is already absorbing many of the costs of dealing with uninsured people’s health, and that this just makes it official.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Still, there’s more work to be done. Rather than relying almost solely on medicine to improve health outcomes, we could look at alternative interventions: adequate housing for people who seek shelter in emergency departments, better nutrition for those suffering from diabetes, transportation services for older adults who can no longer drive to their medical appointments safely. In some cases, such interventions might help obviate the need for additional medical care entirely, while in others they might make certain treatments more successful and efficient. Homeless people, in particular, whose high health-care costs have been well documented by Malcolm Gladwell and others, may benefit from certain interventions. (In 2006, Gladwell wrote about a homeless alcoholic man named Murray Barr, who ran up a huge medical bill because of repeated stints in the emergency room and other issues.) In researching our book, we came across a group of people in Santa Monica, California, who came up with a novel approach to addressing the costs of treating populations like these. One of them, John Maceri, the executive director of the Ocean Park Community Center, opened a special section of his shelter for a small group of especially vulnerable people who were using an extraordinary amount of health-care resources. Maceri persuaded a hospital to help fund the facility, where an on-site nurse could care for uninsured people who had been recently discharged from treatment and had no stable home; the shelter also enrolled these people in primary-care services through a local clinic. Previously, these patients had unusually long hospital stays because they had no place to go, and after being discharged they often turned up in the emergency room again, because they hadn’t had access to follow-up care while on the streets and had developed complications. Under the partnership, these patients could be discharged for follow-up care in an appropriate environment, they were seen less frequently in the emergency room, and they could access basic health-care services through the local clinic. In February of 2011, the hospital estimated that this arrangement would eliminate approximately three hundred thousand dollars in total emergency-room and inpatient charges for ten of these patients in a year’s time. Some may reject the idea of expanding access to social services, but this is not about spending more money. It is about spending the same money more wisely. “You just get them connected to a support system,” Maceri told us. “And if you can help to get them housing, both their physical and mental health get better. It all goes together.” Elizabeth H. Bradley is a professor of public health and the faculty director of the Global Health Leadership Institute at Yale University. Lauren A.

A Botched Operation,62377,"In May of 1990, several hundred physicians gathered in a conference hall at an Atlanta hotel, as uniformed guards stood at the door. Colleagues traded tips about installing bulletproof glass in their offices and spoke about fielding hate mail and death threats. It was the annual gathering of the National Abortion Federation, or N.A.F., a professional association with a beleaguered membership. At the time, fewer than a fifth of the counties in the United States had abortion providers. Since the mid-eighties, clinics across the country had been blockaded, vandalized, and firebombed. Most of the physicians at the conference were well into middle age. The right to safe, legal abortion, which had been established by Roe v. Wade, in 1973, would be rendered meaningless if a new generation of providers didn’t emerge soon. There was at least one younger face at the conference: Steven Chase Brigham. A handsome, genial man in his mid-thirties, with a square jaw and sandy brown hair, Brigham was a recent graduate of Columbia University’s medical school. Articulate, well dressed, and polite, he seemed unusually relaxed and upbeat for an abortion provider. “You sort of notice the newbies, and he seemed like a very personable young man,” Dr. Suzanne Poppema, a former director of N.A.F., recalls. “He was just getting started in the abortion-care business, and was really eager to learn and ask questions.” When talking with N.A.F. members, Brigham repeatedly emphasized the importance of treating patients with respect. Dr. Curtis Boyd, one of N.A.F.’s founders, says, “He knew all the right things to say. He’s very charming.” By the mid-aughts, Brigham was the owner of a large chain of abortion clinics, American Women’s Services. There were more than a dozen branches, in four states: Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, where he was based. The chain had expanded, in part, because he advertised aggressively, promising “caring and supportive” counsellors and “very low fees.” In addition, the number of abortion providers had continued to decline, creating a vacuum that Brigham was able to fill. “Dedicated to Reproductive Freedom and Quality Women’s Healthcare,” the Web site of American Women’s Services proclaimed, above a photograph of a smiling female physician in a white coat. Brigham, who was born in 1956, grew up in a middle-class family in Toledo, Ohio. A gifted athlete who excelled at wrestling and tennis, he also stood out academically. In 1974, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he double-majored in physics and applied biology. He then entered an M.D.-Ph.D. program at Columbia. Although he embarked on a Ph.D. in molecular biology, he never completed a dissertation. Upon receiving his M.D., he did a yearlong internship in internal medicine at the Westchester Medical Center, then bounced around jobs: a few spells in emergency rooms, a stint at a smoking-cessation clinic. One day, while reading the classifieds in the Times, Brigham noticed that a gynecology center in Flushing was soliciting applications for a staff-physician position. Although he was not trained as a gynecologist, he applied, and he was hired. He soon found himself observing, and then performing, various medical procedures there, including first- and second-trimester abortions. Brigham could see that there was a high demand for abortion, even in places where it was viewed with skepticism or hostility. In 1990, he travelled to a small, conservative town in southeastern Pennsylvania called Wyomissing and signed a lease to rent space on the ground floor of an office building. For someone who had spent the previous decade in New York City, Wyomissing—a few miles west of Reading—was a curious destination. It was also a daring place to open an abortion clinic. Brigham told the building’s owners that he intended to start a family-medicine practice, with abortion integrated into a broader repertoire of care. Brigham began placing ads for abortion services in the Yellow Pages. The ads drew a steady stream of pregnant women to his office—and a steady stream of protesters, armed with placards and bullhorns. The commotion escalated, eventually prompting the owners of the building to petition a judge for a temporary injunction against the protesters; after the request was denied, they successfully obtained an injunction against Brigham, who, they claimed, had misrepresented the nature of his medical practice. The controversy attracted extended scrutiny in the local press. One morning, Brigham later recalled, he glanced at the front page of the Reading Eagle and spotted a story, below the fold, about a minor international development: the implosion of the Soviet Union. Above it was yet another story about the turmoil outside his clinic. Many doctors in Brigham’s position would have decided that there were easier ways to make a living. But he seemed immune to such stress. “Nothing bothers him,” a former colleague told me. “I don’t think he gets rattled.” Even before Roe v. Wade, the demand for abortions overwhelmed the capacity of those willing to supply them. In 1972, a year before the Supreme Court’s ruling, a hundred professors of obstetrics signed a statement suggesting that practitioners who did not have moral objections to performing abortions should help meet the “staggering” demand for the procedure, once it was legalized. “If only half of the 20,000 obstetricians in this country do abortions, they can do a million a year at a rate of two per physician per week,” the statement noted. “Already we do more than a million other pelvic operations every year.” This generation of obstetricians had seen women wheeled into emergency rooms, one after another, because they had paid someone without proper training to terminate their pregnancies. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist After Roe v. Wade, many doctors believed that they could quietly incorporate abortion into their practices without inspiring hostility from pro-life activists. Among them was my father, Shalom Press, an Israeli immigrant who, only weeks after the Supreme Court ruling, arrived in Buffalo to complete an ob-gyn residency. By the mid-nineteen-eighties, he had opened a private practice there that offered many services, from delivering babies to performing abortions. Despite this approach, his practice was soon besieged by protesters. By 1988, my senior year in high school, the parking lot at his office teemed with protesters brandishing signs calling him a “baby-killer.” They shouted and thrust pamphlets at his patients. Some of the protesters picketed our home. Eventually, they started blockading the doors of his office, in order to prevent women from entering. The intimidation, the harassment, and the threats all help explain why Brigham was so enthusiastically welcomed when he started attending N.A.F. meetings. But not everyone in the pro-choice community was impressed by him. In 1991, according to a report in the Eagle, Nancy Osgood, the executive director of Planned Parenthood in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, sent a representative to visit Brigham’s clinic in Wyomissing to determine if the facility should be placed on the group’s referral list. While inspecting the facility, the representative noticed that important equipment was missing, including a sonogram machine. The clinic had no written arrangement with a hospital in case something went wrong. Although Brigham advertised “low fees,” women were charged extra for things that were usually included in the price, like Pap smears and post-abortion checkups. Osgood was disturbed by these findings, and did not put Brigham’s clinic on the referral list. Osgood was not the first person to develop doubts about Brigham. According to the Eagle, Brigham had approached Amy Cousins, a gynecologist who performed abortions in Pennsylvania and New York, about working with her. Cousins told the paper that she had doubts about his competence. “I remember him very vividly,” Cousins said recently. “He told me he was a gynecologist, and it turns out he wasn’t.” The vast majority of abortions in America are performed in the first trimester, when complications are very rare and any surgery is straightforward. But the rate of complications rises as women near the end of the second trimester, and terminations done after this point—which, typically, are legal only if the woman’s life or health is in danger—pose a higher risk. In the early nineties, few doctors performed “advanced-gestation abortions” regularly. One who did was George Tiller, a physician based in Wichita. He was among the targets of the 1991 Summer of Mercy, a forty-six-day siege led by Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group. Hundreds of protesters were arrested outside the clinic where he worked. Two years later, while Tiller was pulling out of the clinic’s driveway, his car was sprayed with bullets, and he was wounded in both arms. To people who viewed advanced-gestation abortions as tragic but sometimes unavoidable, doctors willing to be trained in such difficult procedures seemed brave. LeRoy Carhart, an abortion provider who worked with Tiller, recalls meeting Brigham at an N.A.F. meeting, in the early nineties: “He came and asked me if I would train him to do second- and third-trimester abortions.” After learning that Brigham had limited experience doing first-trimester abortions, Carhart cautioned him against the idea. Privately, he was taken aback: “He seemed like a nice person, but I was amazed that somebody would, you know, want to learn how to fly a jumbo jet before he learned how to fly an airplane.” In 1992, Brigham left Wyomissing. “I like Pennsylvania and I like the people, but I have bad feelings about the right-to-lifers,” he told the Reading Times. “Their goal was to drive me from town.” He moved to Voorhees, a town in southern New Jersey, and opened a practice there. He also performed abortions elsewhere, including clinics in Spring Valley, New York, and Flushing. In 1994, the New York Department of Health moved to discipline Brigham for botching two advanced-gestation abortions. One of the women had bled for three hours before being taken to the emergency room. The other had suffered injuries when Brigham continued the procedure even after he accidentally perforated her uterus. A committee reviewing the cases concluded that Brigham had “used inexcusably bad judgment and that his negligence was life threatening.” Brigham, testifying before the board, insisted that he had received “extensive training” in such procedures, mentioning a course that he’d taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic in New York City. The board was not persuaded, noting that he had never completed an ob-gyn residency and had never received a certificate for the course, which, in any case, focussed on first-trimester abortions. It charged him with gross negligence and revoked his license. Not long after the ruling in New York, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners prepared to render judgment on whether it should revoke Brigham’s license, too. The case came before Joseph Fidler, an administrative-law judge. Brigham claimed that complications were inevitable with advanced-gestation abortions, and that his over-all record was sound. Michael Policar, a respected gynecologist and a former national spokesperson for Planned Parenthood, testified on Brigham’s behalf. The injuries that the New York board had attributed to negligence, Policar said, could have happened to patients “in the best of hands.” (Policar told me that he had reviewed the medical records for only two patients, and had never vouched for Brigham’s general competence.) Several other physicians offered similar testimony. Judge Fidler described Brigham as “a sincere and credible witness” who drew satisfaction from his work, “primarily because he was helping women.” In 1996, he ruled in Brigham’s favor, faulting him only for having placed potentially misleading ads for “painless” abortions. Brigham took the judgment as a victory, telling the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, Express-Times that “the New York decision is clearly wrong.” By this point, the protests outside abortion clinics had given way to violence. In March, 1993, a man outside a clinic in Pensacola, Florida, fired three bullets into the back of Dr. David Gunn, killing him. Dr. John Britton, who replaced Gunn at the clinic, was murdered in 1994. Four years later, a sniper hiding in the woods shot and killed Dr. Barnett Slepian while he was standing in the kitchen of his home. Slepian, an ob-gyn, worked at a Buffalo clinic that had been targeted for years by some of the same protesters who demonstrated outside my father’s office. After Slepian’s death, the clinic remained open, but my father became the last ob-gyn in Buffalo who incorporated abortion into his private practice. Not coincidentally, the shootings occurred in the wake of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 decision in which the Supreme Court sustained the “essential holding” of Roe v. Wade. Along with the bombings, the acts of arson, and the death threats routinely visited on abortion clinics, the murders profoundly damaged the image of the pro-life movement, whose leaders had once engaged in civil disobedience, invoking the example of Martin Luther King, Jr. Nevertheless, the violence effectively intimidated physicians, and the Casey ruling began to seem like a hollow victory for defenders of abortion rights. In an editorial published after Britton was shot, the Times observed, “Constitutional right or no, women cannot get abortions if there is nobody to perform them.” One of the few physicians who didn’t seem unnerved by the violence was Brigham. In 1994, he flew to Pensacola and began performing abortions at the clinic where Gunn and Britton had been employed. He continued to promote American Women’s Services, placing ads in the Yellow Pages affirming that abortion was “A Woman’s Right.” Some ads for American Women’s Services promoted low prices and free transportation for women who could not afford it; others promised “No 24 Hour Waiting Period” and “No Parental Consent Required.” Such ads appeared in telephone directories in Pennsylvania, even though state law mandated parental consent for minors and a twenty-four-hour waiting period. Just across the state border, in New Jersey, where such laws did not apply, Brigham operated clinics. In 1996, N.A.F. sent copies of these ads to the attorneys general of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, requesting that they investigate Brigham’s operation and take “appropriate action.” At least within N.A.F., Brigham’s charm had worn off. Some of the organization’s leaders had sat down with Brigham and explained what he would need to do to obtain N.A.F. certification for his clinics. Suzanne Poppema recalls, “We told him, ‘You can’t do second-trimester abortions. You just started out, and you don’t have the skill level.’  ” Curtis Boyd says, “He did not take our advice—he just didn’t. That’s when we realized he could not be salvaged—that he wouldn’t help himself.” N.A.F. eventually barred Brigham from its meetings. Although American Women’s Services continued to market itself, over the next decade Brigham’s name stopped appearing in newspaper headlines. He concentrated on opening clinics in Baltimore, Virginia Beach, and Phillipsburg, New Jersey. Phillipsburg is a half-hour drive from Allentown, Pennsylvania. In 1994, a woman named Jen Boulanger started working as a counsellor at the Allentown Women’s Center, an abortion clinic near the airport. Within three years, she had become its director. Boulanger is now the director of communications at the Women’s Centers, a group of clinics that has a branch in Cherry Hill, and she recently met with me at her office there. When I arrived, notebooks, papers, and manila folders were spread over the floor: all of it was documentation about problems at Brigham’s clinics. Boulanger, a redhead in her early forties, recalls her first years in Allentown as often “hellish,” mainly because of unrelenting protests staged by anti-abortion groups. But there was another, unexpected problem. “The patients I counselled would ask me questions about what they were going to experience,” she explained. “And they would say, ‘Because at the last clinic I went to . . . ’ ” Their complaints were varied: the other clinic had been dirty; the doctor was rude; they were quoted one fee over the phone but charged another at the office; they received no follow-up care. Many of these women had gone to Brigham’s clinic in Phillipsburg. Sometime later, Boulanger began hearing similar complaints about a clinic that had opened up in Allentown, on Hamilton Street. Boulanger discovered that the facility, called Allentown Medical Services, was part of the American Women’s Services chain. Disgruntled patients started calling her to complain about their experiences there, not realizing that by mistake they had reached the Allentown Women’s Center. Brigham’s clinic had adopted a Web address (allentownwomanscenter.com) that differed by just one letter from hers (allentownwomenscenter.com). Boulanger came to believe that this was a ploy to confuse patients. After she sent Brigham a cease-and-desist letter, he changed the U.R.L. Boulanger worried that her reputation would be tarnished, and she feared for the safety of women in the area. She began taking careful notes about what she and her colleagues were hearing. During my visit, she scooped up some of the files on the floor and began reading excerpts aloud. There were stories of abortions being done without a registered nurse on hand, of blood on the floor, and of drugs being administered by untrained personnel. There was a report of plastic instruments being washed with Dial soap and reused. In 2001, a patient said that, after calling the clinic with emergency complaints two weeks after an abortion, she had been told to “have a shot of rum.” In 2002, a former employee of Brigham’s sent Boulanger an e-mail in which she described being “witness to a suction machine accident, in which a second trimester procedure was sprayed all over me and got in my eyes and mouth.” Boulanger looked pale. “It made me cry—that’s how bad it was,” she said. She emphasized that she hadn’t witnessed any wrongdoing herself. In the files that she shared with me, the names of the patients who had relayed their experiences to her had been redacted, making the stories difficult to verify. But the names of some physicians had not been redacted. One of them was Robert Atlas, who is now the chairman of the ob-gyn department at Mercy Medical Center, in Baltimore. He used to work at Lehigh Valley Hospital, where he had seen women in the emergency room who had come from Allentown Medical Services. Although risks are unavoidable with abortion, Atlas told me, “the types of complications that we saw coming from them were so much worse—major perforations to the uterine arteries, defects in the uterus that we couldn’t repair. I had to do three or four hysterectomies.” He added, “I was scared for the patients.” Brigham was not himself treating the patients Atlas was seeing at the hospital. In 1992, just before he moved to New Jersey, he had signed an agreement to stop practicing medicine in Pennsylvania. The move came after officials launched an investigation of his business practices, prompted, in part, by the discovery that he had been shuttling women to an apartment building in Sinking Spring, a town near Wyomissing; this was apparently an attempt to circumvent the injunction that barred Brigham from seeing patients in Wyomissing. Brigham placed his license in Pennsylvania on “permanent inactive status,” and the investigation was closed. The agreement, however, did not make him ineligible to own an abortion clinic in the state. Starting in the late nineties, in plain view of Pennsylvania officials, Brigham opened clinics in Allentown, Erie, State College, and Pittsburgh. These clinics had no trouble finding patients to serve, and they attracted idealistic employees. In the spring of 2006, Libbi Short, a college freshman, responded to an ad in Pittsburgh’s alternative weekly for a receptionist position at an American Women’s Services clinic downtown. The job paid only six-fifty an hour, but Short, an ardent feminist, was eager to put her principles into practice. She was interviewed by the clinic’s manager, and was deeply impressed by what she heard: “This is a pro-choice clinic”; “We’re providing this incredible service to women.” When she got the job, she was elated. On her first day, she was asked to put on scrubs and observe in the procedure room. Later, Short called her mother to tell her how proud she was. “I’m the best feminist ever,” she told herself. Though Short was a nineteen-year-old with no medical training, her responsibilities were not limited to answering the phones. “I was pricking people’s fingers and taking their blood,” she told me recently. “I was assisting all of the procedures. I was administering drugs.” She was shocked by conditions at the clinic: unsanitary rooms, doctors who coldly rushed through procedures, women in agony during abortions. “Screaming and writhing,” she said. “It sounded like people being tortured.” (Another former worker at the clinic recalled similar problems.) One day, roughly a year after Short started working there, she left without bothering to collect her paycheck. She had concluded that the Pittsburgh clinic was exploiting women. “I didn’t even know if I was still pro-choice,” she recalled. She said to herself, “If women are so easily preyed upon in this vulnerable state, I just can’t see a good thing here.” Sometime later, a friend who’d become pregnant asked her to accompany her to another Pittsburgh abortion clinic. Short reluctantly agreed. But the clinic was clean, the staff gracious. She was deeply moved: this was how things were supposed to be. “My friend didn’t cry after her abortion,” Short said. “But I did.” A former women’s-studies major with pale eyes and a blunt, sardonic manner, Short still identifies herself as a feminist. She now works as a coördinator at the clinic that her friend visited. She has a tattoo of Queen Anne’s lace on her right arm, in honor of women who used the plant’s seeds as an abortifacient. She has not spoken publicly before about her experience at American Women’s Services. The caricature of clinics as “abortion mills” run by venal profiteers has long been a staple of the anti-abortion movement. As a result, pro-choice activists understood the potential dangers of drawing attention to any facility that might reinforce this stereotype. One clinic director told me, “We know the anti-choice community will manipulate any story, however minor, to paint the entire abortion-care community with the same brush.” Politicians could cite such stories as justification for imposing burdensome regulations. Yet clinic owners also knew that some providers saw what they did as a business, not as a social mission. As reputable doctors, hospitals, and medical schools increasingly distanced themselves from abortions, it became more likely that substandard providers would fill the void. Although Jen Boulanger knew the risks of going public, she decided to share her concerns with state officials. Near the end of our interview, she looked in a manila folder and fished out an official Pennsylvania Department of State complaint form, dated April, 2003. It described “potentially illegal and disturbing things happening at Allentown Medical Services,” including abortions performed after twenty-four weeks, narcotics left unlocked, and untrained personnel; in some cases, patients had been transported to Allentown after their procedures were started in another state. Boulanger had heard about these problems—some of which potentially violated Pennsylvania’s Abortion Control Act—from a former employee at the clinic, who, the complaint stated, “knows other witnesses and would be willing to report similar complaints.” Boulanger then showed me a one-page letter from the Pennsylvania Department of State, which was sent to her a month and a half after she filed her complaint. The letter noted that an on-site investigation had been conducted at Allentown Medical Services, and had revealed that patients in the recovery room weren’t being properly monitored by nurses; according to a follow-up inspection, the problem had been fixed. Boulanger’s other complaints went unanswered. Seven years later, in February, 2010, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners and the New Jersey Attorney General’s office received packets of letters about an enterprise called Grace Medical Care, whose Web site advertised second- and third-trimester abortions but failed to provide potential patients with basic information, such as the location of the facility. The letters came from staff members at the Cherry Hill clinic where Jen Boulanger works. Elizabeth Barnes, the clinic’s director, informed the board that she had learned that Grace Medical Care, at a facility in New Jersey, was initiating cervical dilation in patients with advanced-gestation fetuses; later, the patients were driven to another state—most likely Maryland—for surgery. Why the elaborate protocol? In New Jersey, after the fourteenth week of pregnancy, an abortion had to be performed in a licensed ambulatory facility or in a hospital, to insure safety. Maryland had no such rule. New Jersey officials did not respond to Barnes. Several months later, on August 13th, a procession of cars drove south from Voorhees, New Jersey, through Delaware, and across the Maryland border. Among the passengers was an eighteen-year-old African-American girl who was twenty-one weeks pregnant. The convoy stopped outside an unmarked storefront in Elkton, Maryland. Inside, Nicola Riley, a physician the girl had never met before, performed an abortion while another doctor—Steven Brigham, the founder of Grace Medical Care—observed. Riley seemed to be training on the job, the patient later told a Maryland investigator. During surgery, the girl’s uterus was perforated and her bowel was damaged, and she was taken by car to a local hospital. She eventually had to be airlifted to Johns Hopkins Hospital. (The girl, who spent a week in the hospital, declined to be interviewed.) A few days afterward, a detective in Elkton got in touch with the Maryland Board of Physicians to find out if Brigham was licensed to practice medicine in the state. He was not. The police obtained a search warrant and raided the building in Elkton. Inside a dingy storeroom, officers pried open a freezer filled with red biohazard bags that contained thirty-five advanced-gestation fetuses—medical remains that had not yet been disposed of. Some of the fetuses were past twenty-four weeks’ gestation, the point of viability. This ghoulish discovery triggered a grand-jury investigation, and in December, 2011, Brigham was arrested and charged with ten counts of murder. A week or so later, he was released, after posting bail of half a million dollars. The investigation of the Elkton incident had thrust Steven Brigham back into the courts and into the headlines. Why had he taken such a risk? Last August, I called his cell-phone number. Brigham answered, and his voice was friendly but circumspect. When I explained that I was a reporter, his guard went up further. “Oh,” he said. “I haven’t had very good experiences with reporters.” I sensed that we weren’t going to be chatting much longer. Before hanging up, Brigham asked what had drawn me to the subject of abortion. I mentioned that I was the son of an abortion provider. “Who?” I gave my father’s name. “I know who your father is!” he exclaimed. “How’s your dad doing?” he asked, warmly. (They’d never met.) We spoke for fifteen minutes. Brigham said that he’d like to talk more but needed to clear it with his lawyer first. A few weeks later, we met in New Jersey, at the office of Brigham’s attorney Joseph Gorrell. By that time, the murder charges had been withdrawn, because Maryland prosecutors had admitted that they could not prove that the fetuses found in Elkton had been aborted there. (Brigham had filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Maryland’s fetal-homicide law—created to punish men who harm pregnant women—does not apply to a physician who provides a lawful abortion.) But Brigham’s legal troubles were hardly over. He was seeing his lawyer to prepare for hearings before an administrative-law judge in New Jersey, where he was once again under investigation; the state had suspended his license, and he was fighting to get it reinstated. Since the outcome of the case was pending, Brigham refrained from commenting on it. But he did discuss why he’d started Grace Medical Care. “What prompted me to start Grace was when Dr. Tiller was killed,” he explained. On May 31, 2009, in Wichita, George Tiller was shot a second time and killed; he had been standing in the foyer of his church, on a Sunday morning. Brigham said he told himself that, in the face of such hatred, he had no choice but to step forward and help meet the needs of desperate women. Brigham wore a tan shirt, a dark blazer, and a burgundy necktie. Now fifty-seven, he looked rested and well groomed; there was no gray in his neatly trimmed hair, and scarcely a wrinkle on his still handsome face. Despite his legal predicament, he seemed in good spirits. He poured himself coffee and, after taking off his blazer, he sat at the end of a table covered with boxes of legal documents and began speaking animatedly about his decision to become an abortion provider. Brigham portrayed himself as an altruistic idealist and said that he had been influenced primarily by his mother, a commodities broker who had been “very active in the women’s-rights movement.” He volunteered that she was only sixteen when she gave birth to him. It must have been an unplanned pregnancy, I ventured. “I imagine it was,” he said. (Brigham’s mother, now seventy-four, did not respond to a request for an interview.) Brigham said that American Women’s Services had been inspired by a physician named Robert Spencer, who in 1919 had begun performing abortions—illegal at the time—in Ashland, a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania. Brigham said of Spencer, “He started, just out of the kindness of his heart, doing procedures, because he felt sorry for the young ladies.” Spencer, he said, came to be revered in his home town. (I later confirmed that this was true.) Before setting up the clinic in Wyomissing, Brigham explained, he had worked for a while at a clinic in Harrisburg, which is not far from Ashland. “I saw patients who had been patients of Dr. Spencer,” he said. Brigham was cordial and ingratiating, and he never raised his voice. He seemed so convinced of the purity of his intentions and the bad faith of his detractors—they were either protesters or competitors, he said—that, while he spoke, it became difficult to imagine otherwise. He recalled that, in 1998, after Barnett Slepian was murdered, he arranged for a physician affiliated with American Women’s Services to work for several days at the Buffalo clinic where Slepian had been employed, as a gesture of support. I later called the clinic’s director at the time, and learned that this, too, was true. Brigham told me that he had first learned to perform abortions at Columbia, during a rotation presided over by a physician named Jack Maidman. The tutorials took place early in the morning, and none of his peers had signed up. “It was just me and Dr. Maidman,” he said. I subsequently called Maidman, who said that he didn’t remember Brigham. Maidman emphatically dismissed the scenario, saying, “There was nothing that I would have done that could have been construed as a formal training program in abortion for a medical student.” The raid on the Elkton facility prompted Maryland officials to implement regulations for providers of surgical abortions. Inspectors were dispatched to the state’s sixteen surgical facilities, and found serious deficiencies at four of them—all of which were run by a group called Associates in OB/GYN Care. At one of the clinics, a woman had been left in a room with an unlicensed assistant who had not been trained to use the facility’s cardiac machine, which, in any case, was broken; after the patient had a cardiopulmonary arrest, she was sent to a hospital, where she died. Maryland officials suspended the medical license of Mansour G. Panah, the medical director of Associates in OB/GYN Care. His license, it turned out, had been suspended twice before, for unwanted sexual contact with patients. Employees of Associates in OB/GYN Care initially denied having any link to Brigham, but, as they later acknowledged, he owned the entity that provided its clinics with physician services. The four clinics were listed on the Web site of American Women’s Services. In July of last year, the Times published an article, with the headline “maryland’s path to an accord in abortion fight,” about regulatory reforms that had been instituted after the scandal at the Elkton clinic. The article reported that the licenses of the four Associates in OB/GYN Care clinics had been suspended in May. One morning, a few weeks after the Times story appeared, I visited one of the clinics, which was on the second floor of an office building in a run-down section of Cheverly, a Maryland suburb outside Washington, D.C. A sign on the door said, “American Women’s Services, Suite 6.” Several young women were waiting in a vestibule outside the office. It opened at 11 a.m., and the women went in. By noon, a dozen other women had squeezed into the waiting room, a cramped chamber with linoleum floors that smelled of cheap disinfectant. A television mounted on the wall played the film “Wedding Crashers” at a blaring volume. The patients sat quietly, until the woman sitting next to me rose to complain that she wasn’t feeling well. “I’m dehydrated,” she told the receptionist. Moments later, the woman came back to her chair. “They got water, but no cups,” she said, sighing. All but one of the patients were women of color; the surrounding area has a significant population of African immigrants. How could a facility whose license had been suspended still be seeing patients? The suspension, I later learned, did not apply to medical abortions, which involve the administering of such drugs as mifepristone (formerly known as RU-486). The person who told me this works at an abortion clinic in Germantown, a wealthier Maryland suburb. Ten or so women who had gone to the Cheverly office—and whose medical abortions had failed—had been referred to the Germantown facility. They were now farther along in their pregnancies, and needed second-trimester surgical abortions. Staff members at the Germantown clinic were surprised by how frequently this was happening, because mifepristone—the most common and most effective method for medical abortions—is highly reliable. They then discovered that the Cheverly clinic was dispensing methotrexate, which was commonly used to induce abortions before mifepristone was approved by the F.D.A. A cancer drug that can have life-threatening consequences, methotrexate can take several weeks to terminate a pregnancy, whereas mifepristone works within two days. The Cheverly facility was charging patients for follow-up appointments. Brigham argues that patients should not be charged in advance for services that they might want to get elsewhere, but at most clinics follow-up care is considered essential, and is included in the initial fee to insure that patients show up for it. Brigham told me that his clinics use methotrexate because mifepristone has been implicated in “numerous” patient deaths. (Between 2000 and 2011, fourteen women died after taking mifepristone, but an F.D.A. investigation failed to find a causal link to the drug.) A counsellor at the clinic in Germantown suggested to me that Brigham had less lofty motives. Mifepristone pills “cost about ninety-four dollars apiece,” she said. A dose of methotrexate costs between five and twenty-five dollars. In Maryland, a medical abortion generally costs about three hundred and seventy-five dollars. LeRoy Carhart, the doctor who had worked closely with George Tiller, told me that for a clinic that uses methotrexate “the profit margin is huge.” Carhart, now seventy-two, is an avuncular man with a shock of gray hair and soft pouches beneath his eyes. Based in Omaha, he flies to Maryland every week to perform surgery at the Germantown clinic. Since Tiller’s murder, there are only four doctors in the country who openly provide third-trimester abortions. Carhart told me that, the next day, he was seeing patients in Indiana. When wasn’t he working? “Never,” he said. “When George died, that was the last time I had time off.” Since Carhart started performing abortions, in 1988, the number of abortion providers in the U.S. has fallen by a third—a decline that he attributes to protesters. “They have made it so the good physicians don’t really want to get involved,” he explained. “Now you have two types of doctors doing abortions—the doctors who are totally committed to women’s health and are going to do them even if they never get another dime, and the people that just want to take advantage of the situation and milk everything they can out of it.” Allegations that Brigham took advantage of women—especially poor women—first surfaced back in Wyomissing, when Planned Parenthood discovered that the “low fees” he advertised weren’t so low. In 1991, Nancy Osgood, of Planned Parenthood, told the Reading Eagle that Brigham’s prices for second-trimester abortions were considerably higher than those of his competitors. In addition, his clinic accepted jewelry and other personal property as collateral from indigent patients, who were then sent to a nearby loan office. Osgood called these practices “noxious.” During our conversation, Brigham did not deny that such arrangements were made, but he portrayed them as unavoidable, even magnanimous. “The right-to-lifers called me the pawn-shop abortion doctor, but the patients didn’t have any money, because they’re poor, and Medicaid wouldn’t pay for it,” he told me. He said that he was acting in the spirit of Robert Spencer, who accepted payment on a sliding scale. “My kindness was turned against me,” Brigham said. A different picture emerges in Jen Boulanger’s documents. There is an account of a woman who called to schedule a follow-up appointment at Brigham’s clinic in Phillipsburg, because she believed that she was still pregnant, but who was turned away because she couldn’t afford the fifty-five-dollar fee. “She said she feels sick now—very nauseous,” a write-up of her complaint stated. Libbi Short told me that, at Brigham’s Pittsburgh clinic, everything was done on the cheap. “It was all about money,” she said. In a 2010 book, “Dispatches from the Abortion Wars,” Carole Joffe, a sociologist, writes about the emergence of “rogue clinics” that lure poor women with the promise of low prices and then provide substandard care. “Rogue clinics typically undercut prices,” Joffe told me. “They play fast and loose with laws. So that means their costs are less than those of other clinics that conform to other requirements. They typically prey on immigrant communities, and they prey on poorer women.” In 2011, an extreme version of this phenomenon made national news: a filth-strewn, blood-spattered clinic in inner-city Philadelphia, run for decades by a doctor named Kermit B. Gosnell. As detailed in a grand-jury report, Gosnell’s crimes—severing the spines of viable fetuses with scissors, maiming women doped up on drugs—continued even though Pennsylvania officials had received many complaints about his clinic, which served a predominantly poor clientele. Gosnell was convicted of murder in May. Since then, legislators in Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas have passed new restrictions, some requiring that abortions be done in a surgical ambulatory facility, others stipulating that a doctor performing surgery at a clinic must secure local hospital admission privileges, even if he or she is flying in from another part of the country. Critics of such legislation argue that unethical providers can be shut down simply by enforcing existing laws, and that the new restrictions are designed to drive safe clinics out of business, under the guise of protecting women, and will ultimately expose them to more risk. This is the view of Joffe, who argues in her book that rogue clinics have proliferated as accessible options have vanished and the demographics of abortion have changed. Between 2000 and 2008, the over-all abortion rate fell by eight per cent. But among poor women it rose by eighteen per cent. African-American women are nearly four times as likely as white women to get an abortion. This shift is often attributed to rising inequality, with lower-income women having less access to the most effective forms of contraception, less sex education, and less ability to bear the cost of an unanticipated child. Jen Boulanger told me that although many of the patients who complained to her about Brigham’s Allentown clinic were poor, some were middle-class professionals. Shame, not poverty, led many women to expect to be treated shabbily at an abortion clinic. Unscrupulous providers, she argued, exploited this stigma. During a recent visit to Allentown, I met with a woman named Sarah Tombler-Gimpel. Two years ago, after learning that she was pregnant, she typed the words “Pennsylvania” and “abortion services” into Google. A link to American Women’s Services appeared, and she clicked on it. Tombler-Gimpel had had an abortion once before, at the Allentown Women’s Center, the clinic Jen Boulanger used to run. She felt that the care had been good, but she didn’t want to go back. “I was embarrassed,” she explained. “Here I am, I’ve gone through it once, got the birth control. I’m twenty-eight years old, and I can’t figure it out yet?” Tombler-Gimpel is passionately pro-choice, and she didn’t seem like the kind of person who would be vulnerable to such feelings. But the shame was there all the same, compounded by the memory of growing up on food stamps in a poor, single-parent home. Determined to avoid getting trapped in the same cycle—and to keep her abortion a secret—she sought out a clinic that was quick, cheap, and anonymous. “I was definitely looking for the fast-food experience,” she told me. On October 26, 2011, Tombler-Gimpel showed up for an appointment at Allentown Medical Services, entering a waiting room with ratty carpeting and a jumble of chairs arranged against the walls. The wait “was hours, hours,” she recalled. Shortly after she was administered sedatives, a team of E.M.S. first responders rushed in, strapped her onto a gurney, and took her in an ambulance to Lehigh Valley Hospital. One of the clinic’s doctors had called the hospital and expressed worry that he had punctured a patient’s uterus after inserting a dilator “way too far” during an abortion. At the hospital, a bedside ultrasound revealed a “possible defect” in Tombler-Gimpel’s uterus, but no sign of fetal demise. The next day, after she was discharged, Tombler-Gimpel received a call from Allentown Medical Services and was told to come back in two weeks—the amount of time that she needed to heal. Ten days later, she woke up feeling feverish, and soon developed chills. When her boyfriend visited her apartment, he found her curled up in a ball on the couch, moaning. As she later realized, she was in the throes of septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition that could have been avoided if she had been put on antibiotics, or if someone at the clinic had followed up and arranged for her to undergo diagnostic tests. Tombler-Gimpel called the clinic, hoping to speak with a doctor. “I don’t feel good, you need to finish!” she pleaded. She was told, “We can’t do anything for you—you need to go to the emergency room.” She went back to Lehigh Valley Hospital, where, after being given a diagnosis of a septic abortion, she underwent a dilation and evacuation. Afterward, the physician who treated Tombler-Gimpel told her that, had she waited another day, she might not have survived. “I was literally dying,” Tombler-Gimpel said. At the hospital, she finally received a visit from the doctor at Allentown Medical Services who had sent her to the E.R. According to Tombler-Gimpel, he advised her not to “make a big fuss about this,” because abortion clinics were already under so much pressure. Tombler-Gimpel hadn’t been inclined to make a big fuss: having kept her pregnancy a secret, the last thing she wanted was to spread the word about the abortion. The doctor left without offering to refund her money. On October 2nd, hearings began in the case that will determine if Steven Brigham will get his license reinstated in New Jersey. The proceedings were held in Mercerville, before an administrative-law judge named Jeff Masin, in a fluorescent-lit courtroom with four rows of chairs reserved for spectators. When I arrived, these chairs were empty. Brigham walked in ten minutes later, and he smiled at me. “How are you doing?” he asked. He was wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and metal-frame spectacles, and he had a leather briefcase tucked beneath his arm. I asked him where the 1996 hearings had taken place. “Right here, in this same room,” he said, peering around the empty chamber. The earlier case had drawn many right-to-life protesters, he said, with a glimmer of pride. Why weren’t any around now? “I think it’s because nobody knows about it,” he said. At our previous meeting, Brigham had painstakingly recounted the harassment that he’d endured from right-to-life activists, pausing occasionally to ask me if my father had experienced similar treatment. The implication was clear: like George Tiller, like LeRoy Carhart, and like many other abortion providers, including my father, Brigham was a dedicated doctor, and the zealotry of the religious right was responsible for his troubles. In an opening statement, Joseph Gorrell, Brigham’s lawyer, said that the proceedings were part of a nationwide assault on “physicians who lawfully and competently provide a needed and desired medical service for women in this country.” Jeri Warhaftig, New Jersey’s deputy attorney general, countered that the trial was simply about a “bad doctor”; it was not a referendum on the morality of abortion. In all likelihood, Brigham’s future will turn on a more technical question. According to the state, he violated New Jersey law by performing abortions after the fourteenth week of pregnancy at his clinic in Voorhees. The patients had their cervixes dilated and were given drugs to initiate fetal demise. According to Brigham, what took place in Voorhees was merely preparatory steps before surgical abortions were performed in Maryland. Judge Masin will also have to decide whether the practice of sending patients across state borders compromised the women’s safety. Although these women were not forced to patronize Grace, it appears that some of them were deceived. On October 18th, the patient whose ordeal triggered the raid on the Elkton clinic appeared in Mercerville to testify. Speaking in a soft, slightly tremulous voice, the young woman, whom the court identified as “D.B.,” said that she found Brigham’s Voorhees clinic through Google. When she visited it, she was told that the surgical part of her procedure would be done in Philadelphia; no one mentioned Maryland. She also assumed that transportation would be provided. Instead, when she returned to Brigham’s office on the day of the surgery, she had to climb into the back of her mother’s car while reeling in pain: she had been given medication to dilate her cervix. Her boyfriend drove the car, following a caravan to an unknown destination. When the caravan reached Elkton, she climbed out, disoriented. “I just saw a building that looked kind of abandoned,” she said. The clinic had no sign. Along with two other patients—one Indian, the other Latina—D.B. was escorted to a waiting room with bare walls. The Indian woman had her procedure done first, D.B. testified, because she was screaming the loudest. Deputy Attorney General Warhaftig asked D.B. if she knew that Brigham didn’t have a license in Maryland. “No,” she said. Did she know that Dr. Nicola Riley, who was based in Utah, had obtained her Maryland license less than a month before the procedure? “No.” Did she know that Dr. Riley was going to do the procedure? “No.” It all sounded eerily like a story from the era before Roe v. Wade. Indeed, D.B.’s mother, who testified next, said she had assumed that the enterprise was illegal. She recounted pleading, in vain, for someone to call an ambulance when it was clear that something was awry. Brigham and Riley eventually drove D.B. to the hospital. After D.B.’s botched procedure, the Maryland State Board of Physicians ordered Brigham to stop practicing medicine in the state. Brigham, however, contends that nothing improper occurred. He told me that the out-of-the-way location was a safety precaution, taken to keep protesters away. Although he did not have a Maryland license, the state permitted out-of-state doctors to engage in consultation with peers who did. After our conversation, I learned that the licensed physician with whom Brigham “consulted” was a then eighty-eight-year-old man named George Shepard, Jr., who was too infirm to travel to Mercerville to testify. Nicola Riley, the doctor who performed D.B.’s abortion, had been dishonorably discharged from the Army for stealing jewelry. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, after attending medical school she opened a practice in Utah that focussed on serving transgender patients and other marginalized groups. Her patients there held her in high esteem. It is unclear how much Riley knew about Brigham before appearing in Elkton, where she apparently started working to earn more income. When I contacted her about Brigham, she said, “It’s unfortunate that certain doctors undermine the work that other doctors or people have done to insure that women continue to have the right to choose.” In her testimony, D.B. alluded to reaching a settlement with Riley. D.B. considered suing Brigham as well, until her lawyer discovered that he didn’t have medical-malpractice insurance—a revelation that surprised the prosecution, because Brigham had given a sworn statement affirming otherwise. The state investigated, and found that the insurance Brigham had been using came from a Bermuda-based company that hadn’t issued policies since 2006, and whose owner has been jailed for fraud. Sarah Tombler-Gimpel, the woman from Allentown, based her judgment of American Women’s Services on its Web site. “It’s really snazzy,” she told me one night in nearby Bethlehem, where she now lives. When I told her that there had been complaints about the clinics for more than a decade, her mouth fell open. “I didn’t go to an unlicensed, back-alley clinic!” she said, her eyes gleaming with anger. “I went to a place with the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s seal of approval.” Tombler-Gimpel could not understand how a facility owned by a doctor who could not practice medicine in Pennsylvania had remained open. One reason was the tenacity—some might say shamelessness—of its founder. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Health barred Brigham from “directly or indirectly” registering a facility in the state, because he had twice been caught employing medical personnel without proper credentials. Ownership of the Allentown and Pittsburgh clinics was soon transferred to a new entity, headed by a woman named Judith Fitch—Brigham’s mother. Tombler-Gimpel was even more upset about what had happened at Lehigh Valley Hospital: she felt that she’d been hastily discharged after staff repeatedly showed her sonograms indicating that the fetus was still alive, as if this news would thrill her, and then led her to believe, erroneously, that she could still have the baby. Although she was advised to return to the hospital if she developed signs of an infection, she was not put on antibiotics. Lehigh Valley Hospital declined to comment on the case. Since the nineteen-eighties, abortions performed there have been limited to rare cases, such as pregnancies involving fetal anomalies. One person who has watched such policies become commonplace is Sylvia Stengle. Now seventy-four, Stengle has flowing white hair that used to be flaming orange, earning her the nickname Rusty. In 1971, she founded the first abortion-rights group in the Lehigh Valley. Seven years later, she opened the first abortion clinic in Allentown, the Allentown Women’s Center. That year, the majority of abortion providers in the U.S. were not freestanding clinics but hospitals. Clinics arose, in part, because pioneers like Stengle believed that women could get superior care at them. But, over time, she came to wonder about the tradeoffs. “In the long run, the fact that abortion was sliced off from mainstream medicine has had dire consequences,” Stengle said. Brigham’s Allentown and Pittsburgh clinics finally closed, in 2012. When I asked him about these facilities, he spoke glowingly of them. “We had no deaths, ever,” he said. “The patients were very happy.” He added that the final inspection done by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 2011, found “no deficiencies.” This is true, but after Allentown Medical Services closed down—it had lost its lease—the state sent a scathing letter to Brigham, noting that the Department of Health had long “witnessed a chronic inability by A.M.S. to comply with the most fundamental statutory and regulatory requirements.” It wasn’t just protesters who failed to make Brigham question himself. When employees at other clinics raised concerns about American Women’s Services, he dismissed them as cutthroat rivals. “Some providers try to use the disciplinary process for their competitive advantage,” he said. When states reprimanded him, he insisted that they were seizing on one innocent mistake and ignoring the larger picture. But the larger picture was the issue: problems had surfaced at Brigham’s facilities with disturbing consistency. In the case of Kermit Gosnell, the substandard care was clearly driven by greed, and money has likely played a role in Brigham’s story, too. At the Mercerville hearings, a police detective from Elkton described raiding Brigham’s office in Voorhees and finding a computer disk with a file on it: “Ten Ways to Make a Million Dollars.” It’s hard to believe that, if Brigham had simply wanted to become rich, he couldn’t have become, say, a plastic surgeon. It’s also unclear how lucrative it was to keep pushing the boundaries of permissibility. In Mercerville, Brigham was asked whether financial pressure had led him to launch Grace Medical Care. “Would you agree with me that your cash-flow status . . . was not good?” Jeri Warhaftig asked. “We were having cash-flow problems,” he acknowledged. (In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service declared that Brigham owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid payroll taxes.) Marie McCullough, a reporter who has extensively covered Brigham’s legal troubles for the Philadelphia Inquirer, told me, “I’ve always thought that if he just played by the rules he could have been much more successful. I think he has a need to manipulate the system.” With his career, Brigham achieved a rare thing: he got both sides in the abortion conflict to agree on something. Women’s-health practitioners were often the first to sound warnings about Brigham’s clinics. Yet not all of his peers view him as a rogue provider. Among the expert witnesses at his trial was Gary Mucciolo, an abortion provider and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at N.Y.U.; he argued that Brigham’s conduct did not deviate from medical norms. During a break in the proceedings, Mucciolo, who received fifteen hundred dollars from the defense, told me that he considered the trial “a witch hunt.” (Later, he added, “Does Brigham have a good track record? Frankly, I don’t know.”) Another abortion provider told me, “The real story is that the government, the insurance companies, and the hospitals don’t care. They don’t want us in business, and that’s exactly why people like Brigham exist—and you know what, maybe they should exist, because, if they don’t exist, women will get abortions even more illegally. It’s better than nothing, and nothing is coming.” I heard a variation on this theme from Katharine Morrison, the director of Buffalo Women Services, the clinic where Barnett Slepian once worked. In 2002, Brigham tried to open a clinic in Buffalo, but reconsidered after he was intensely criticized in the local media. It was a rare instance where he did get rattled. Some might say that, as a result, vulnerable women were spared. But although Morrison is glad that Brigham didn’t come to Buffalo, she sees a more systemic problem. She cited the case of a twenty-one-year-old African-American woman who came to see her in March. The woman was twenty weeks pregnant, overweight, and poor; she lacked health insurance, and she had a heart condition that, a doctor told her, made bearing a child potentially lethal. The woman, who had already undergone two heart transplants, learned that she was pregnant after going to the hospital with chest pain. Because of the woman’s risk of complications from surgery, Morrison felt the only safe place to treat her was a hospital. This would not have been a problem a decade ago, when many hospitals in Buffalo admitted patients like her. Virtually none do so today, owing mainly to pressure from donors opposed to abortion. Morrison petitioned the ethics committee at Buffalo Women’s and Children’s Hospital, where women in medically compromising situations are still admitted—in theory, at least. Her request was denied, on the ground that, at the time of the committee’s deliberations, the patient’s condition was stable. Morrison appealed the committee’s decision and, in a letter, reminded its members that, in the nineteen-fifties, hospital committees had often determined whether women merited getting abortions on the basis of “class, race and other non-medical issues.” The denial was upheld, and Morrison ended up doing the procedure at her clinic. She told me, “I was faced with a choice of doing an abortion in a setting that was inappropriate, or forcing a poor girl to continue a pregnancy that could kill her. It’s an example of what happens today to a poor, disenfranchised woman.” After Brigham’s facilities in Pennsylvania were closed, a new state law imposed rigid specifications on things like air-conditioning systems and floors, forcing clinics across the state to undertake expensive, time-consuming renovations. Jane Green, who was running a small clinic in Chester, serving a low-income clientele, was forced to shut down. “It was just financially impossible,” she said. “I feel like a scapegoat.” In one year, the number of clinics in Pennsylvania fell from twenty-two to seventeen. One person who appears to be unintimidated by the new restrictions is Steven Brigham. On a drizzly morning in November, I drove to an office building, in northeast Philadelphia, with a pink façade and a new tenant: Integrity Family Health. The Inquirer had reported rumors that the facility had ties to Brigham, who has a history of setting up clinics with names like Goodness, Inc., and Kindness Corp. On the Tuesday I dropped by, the blinds on the ground-floor windows were drawn. The light in the foyer was off. I pressed to open the glass entrance door, but it didn’t budge. I spent an hour standing around outside, watching rain spatter the pavement while I waited for someone with keys to arrive. No one did. The next day, I found out that the Pennsylvania Department of Health was suspending Integrity Family Health for its “failure to disclose” its affiliation with Brigham. Among other things, the clinic’s toll-free number was the same as that of American Women’s Services. (Brigham denies having a connection to the clinic.) It is unclear how much of an impact the scandals have had on Brigham’s business. In October, 2013, all four of the Maryland clinics shut down, but they may well reopen, and Brigham still operates clinics in Virginia and New Jersey. His conflicts with the law have not left him feeling chastened, even if things haven’t turned out quite the way he hoped. Near the end of our interview, I asked him if he wished that he had done anything differently. “I have a lot of regrets,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “I don’t know where to start.” He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “I thought that I could go into this and just be a doctor,” he said. “And the politics so overwhelm the medicine, and they overwhelm the medical boards, they overwhelm everything we do.” He paused. “The whole thing is just disappointing. It’s disappointing when it’s unfair and unjust—when there are unfair or unjust criticisms levelled at you.” For the first time, Brigham looked agitated, and I felt a shiver of sympathy. Then I realized that the only person he felt sorry for was himself. “I was looking into all kinds of specialties, all kinds of medicine,” he said. “I’m a graduate of an Ivy League medical school. It’s unfortunate that the politics of abortion have caused me to end up in this situation.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Liberalism Will Survive Obamacare,10290,"Here’s today’s quiz: What is American liberalism, and how is it doing? In response to the first half of the question, and bowing to the contemporary wisdom that anything can be reduced to the length of a tweet, I offer up this definition: American liberalism is belief system that combines egalitarian impulses with a conviction that markets often fail and that the government should seek to address these failures. (Actually, that’s about one and a half tweets, but never mind.) Now to how liberalism is faring. If you’ve been reading some of the articles out of Washington in recent weeks, you may have received the impression that it’s an endangered creed, and that the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act might just about finish it off. I’m not just referring to the coverage in conservative outlets like the National Review, the Weekly Standard, and the op-ed page of the Wall Street Journal, which have been publishing obituaries of liberalism for decades. In mainstream and even liberal publications, some of the best columnists in Washington have expressed worries that the problems afflicting healthcare.gov amount to such a political disaster that they endanger the very idea of activist government, which lies at heart of progressivism. For a number of reasons, I think that it is going too far. Obamacare, lest we forget, isn’t a particularly liberal reform; it originated as a right-wing counter-proposal to Hillarycare. How, then, can it be a test of liberalism? And anyway, American liberalism, like its opposite number, American conservatism, is much bigger than any individual policy or slip-up, however dire. To suggest that the problems of the A.C.A. will do irreparable damage to liberalism makes about as much sense as suggesting that the government shutdown will do irreparable damage to conservatism. It confuses politics with history and ideology. On one level, the “bed-wetters”—according to Franklin Foer, the editor of the revitalized New Republic, this is the term that White House officials reserve for the Administration’s worrywart supporters—are obviously right. The launch of healthcare.gov has been horrendously botched, and Obama’s misleading statements about what would happen to Americans who wanted to keep their individual policies have come back to bedevil him. In Foer’s words, the Administration “has stifled bad news and fudged promises; it has failed to translate complex mechanisms of policy into plain English; it can’t even launch a damn website. What’s more, nobody responsible for the debacle has lost a job or suffered a demotion.” Actually, that isn’t quite accurate. Under the ambit of the A.C.A., more than a dozen states have launched Web sites that appear to be working reasonably well. And earlier this month, Tony Trenkle, the chief information officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for building and operating healthcare.gov, quietly announced his resignation. But the basic point is inarguable: in rolling out the A.C.A., the White House has screwed up very badly. If the political gods had empowered the ghost of Lee Atwater to undermine President Obama’s second term, torpedo his poll ratings, and give the benighted G.O.P. at least a slight hope of seizing the Senate in the 2014 midterms, it is unlikely that the godfather of negative campaigning could have come up with something as fiendish as this. Perhaps that is all the Administration’s critics are saying; if so, I am with them. What I object to is the larger suggestion—sometimes it is made explicit; often it remains implicit—that Obamacare is the embodiment of twenty-first-century liberalism, and that its failure would upend the entire liberal project (whatever that may be). Neither claim withstands examination. Until pretty recently, the liberal position on health-care reform was closely identified with support for the public option—a government-run insurance scheme that would compete with the likes of Aetna and United Healthcare. The idea of leaving the private insurance system as it is and expanding coverage by making its purchase mandatory emerged from the Heritage Foundation in the early nineteen-nineties. Even after Mitt Romney successfully introduced a version of this policy proposal in Massachusetts, most liberals regarded it as inadequate, or as a sop to the big insurers. But in early 2009, the Obama White House overruled liberal opposition and settled on a revised version of Romneycare for the entire country. What turned Obamacare into rallying cry for liberals wasn’t any newfound enthusiasm for private insurance companies or individual mandates. Most progressive activists and commentators still hankered for the public option. The decisive factor was that Republicans opposed the A.C.A. with such venom and vigor. If Mitch McConnell, Michele Bachmann, and Marco Rubio hated it so much, it couldn’t be so bad—that was the thinking in liberal circles. And, indeed, the legislation wasn’t so bad. In preventing insurers from barring people with preëxisting conditions, insisting on community rating, expanding Medicaid significantly, and offering low-to-middle-income families generous subsidies for the purchase of private policies, it corrected some glaring market failures and redistributed resources toward the needy. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Strictly speaking, however, Obamacare isn’t a test of liberalism; it’s a test of technocratic centrism of the sort advocated by Romney and, eventually, endorsed by Obama. If the reform has any liberal antecedents, they lie in the “Third Way” neoliberalism associated with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. While some aspects of that doctrine remained hazy even to its proponents, one of its clear and central tenets was that, wherever possible, the private sector should be left to deliver goods and services. In both Romneycare and the A.C.A., the designers of the system went to great lengths to make sure this would happen. The system of employer-financed insurance was left intact. In the individual market, the government set out to facilitate private commerce by setting up online marketplaces populated by insurance companies and providing subsidies to those purchasers that needed them. The great irony of Obama’s reforms is that the most “socialized” bits of them—the expansion of Medicaid and new regulations that prevent insurers from discriminating against the sick, the old, and the female—are working out pretty well. Where the Administration has gotten into trouble is in trying to promote private enterprise. Even in the best scenarios, improving the workings of the individual insurance market was going to be a formidable challenge. When Republican governors and state legislators all across the country refused to set up their own exchanges, or expand Medicaid, it turned into a logistical nightmare in the making. To be sure, the Administration deserves criticism for sticking its head in the sand and pretending that things were going to work out well, even as it was being warned they weren’t. But to call this a failure of liberalism is to bludgeon the English language. It’s a failure—or, rather, a botched launch—of a well-meaning effort to find the middle ground. And, at least for now, it’s a triumph for obstreperousness on the part of the G.O.P. And what about the liberals—the ones who pushed the White House to pursue something more radical than a souped-up version of Romneycare? Even if the A.C.A. were to collapse before it got going—and as I’ve said several times, I don’t expect this will happen—they wouldn’t be routed; they would be vindicated. Far from slinking away and conceding that their grand plans had failed, they would once again take up the campaign, which has been active in various forms since the nineteen-sixties, for the public option, and perhaps even a single-payer system. That’s the thing about liberalism, and also conservatism. They endure all manner of successes and failures, transcending individual pieces of empirical evidence. And that’s because these ideologies exist on a higher plane than everyday political jockeying. Depending on what theory of history you subscribe to, liberalism is a branch of rational thinking applied to politics, an expression of certain underlying ethical values, or a bourgeois conceit that capitalism can be tamed. From a practical perspective, it doesn’t even matter much which of these descriptions is accurate. All of them imply that liberalism isn’t a fixed policy agenda that can be fulfilled or demolished; it is a morally driven struggle for improvement. As such, it will only be defeated when the problems it addresses vanish. Which means never. As long as the market economy generates negative spillovers, such as toxic emissions and global warming, there will be calls for the government to take remedial action. As long as the top few per cent of the income distribution swallows up almost all the gains from economic growth, there will be demands for measures to tackle rising inequality. And as long as the U.S. health-care system, at enormous cost, generates over-all health-care outcomes that are inferior to much cheaper systems abroad, there will be a need for reforms—and liberals will be in the vanguard of proposing them. Up to a point, the worrywarts are right. So far, Obamacare has been a political disaster for the Democrats, and it risks undermining public support for other ambitious policy programs. (According to Gallup, fifty-four per cent of Americans now disapprove of the A.C.A.) But American liberalism isn’t finished. It’s hardly got going. Photograph by Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty.

Some Good News on Health Care,8029,"Given the political frenzy in Washington about the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, it may be folly to try and make any serious points about the legislation’s long-term prospects, or about any other subject having to do with health care. Until and unless healthcare.gov is fixed, the reform will remain an open sore for the Obama Administration, and the Republicans will continue to pour salt on it. That’s only to be expected. Still, beyond the troubles of the federal online exchange, there’s other stuff happening, and some of it is encouraging. I’m not talking here about the rising number of people signing up for coverage on the state-run insurance exchanges, although that development, which I pointed to a couple of days ago, is continuing. My subject today is a potentially historic slowdown in the rate at which over-all spending on health care is growing. The A.C.A. was intended to cover as many as possible of the fifty million Americans who don’t have any health-care coverage. But it was also designed to address inflation in health-care costs, which has been running rampant for decades. Although not recently, it turns out. Since 2010, according to a new report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, inflation-adjusted per-capita health-care spending has been rising at an annual rate of just 1.3 per cent. Depending on which index of prices you look at, that’s the lowest rate of increase in forty or fifty years. The slowdown in spending growth has extended across all the big categories (hospital care, physician and clinical services, prescription drugs, home health/nursing care) and across all types of health plans (private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid). It’s a big deal. To be sure, it’s too early to celebrate, or to attribute the slowdown in spending growth to the A.C.A, which is only starting to make its impact felt. We’ve seen periods before when the rate of health-care inflation seemed to be falling—the early nineteen-nineties come to mind—only for it to pick up again. But it’s not premature to start hoping. According to the White House’s figures, the period of markedly smaller rises in health-care spending has now extended for six years. It began in 2007, and, as far the government’s statisticians can tell, it has continued into 2013. Indeed, the slowdown has been getting more marked. Between 2007 and 2010, spending increased by 1.8 per cent a year. Since 2010, the annual rate of increase has fallen another half a percentage point. Many observers, myself included, initially assumed that the slowdown was an artifact of the recession. During deep slumps, such as the one that the economy went through in 2008 and 2009, spending on everything declines, health care included. But as spending in the rest of the economy has picked up, not spectacularly but pretty steadily, outlays on health care have continued to lag, fanning the suspicion that something more than cyclical factors are at work. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist If the slowdown in spending growth were to be sustained, it would transform the policy debate about spending and budget deficits. For decades now, the big worry in Washington has been that rising health-care costs will gradually swallow up household and government budgets, squeezing out other forms of spending, and sending the budget deficit soaring. The numbers seemed to show that this was inevitable. Between 1965 and 2010, per-capita outlays on health care increased at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent. At that rate of growth, over-all spending doubles every sixteen years, and the ramifications for purchasers of health care—individuals, firms, and the government—are huge. We’ve all seen the Congressional Budget Office projections that show Medicare and Medicaid accounting for an ever-increasing proportion of the federal budget. If the rate of growth of health-care spending were to remain at 1.5 per cent a year, or thereabouts, rather than 4.5 per cent, the long-term trends would look very different. Instead of doubling every sixteen years, healthcare spending would take almost fifty years to double. And as long as the economy and tax revenues expanded at a reasonable rate—say 2.25 per cent or more per annum, after adjusting for inflation—the proportion of G.D.P. and the federal budget devoted to health-care spending would level off rather than continuing to climb. Even a more modest but permanent fall in the rate at which spending rises—to two or three per cent a year—would have a big financial and political impact over the long term. As long as health-care outlays rise more or less in line with G.D.P., they can be financed pretty readily, and the threat of a fiscal crisis is greatly diminished. What has caused the slowdown in spending growth? The Council of Economic Advisers, understandably enough, is keen to assign some credit to the A.C.A., which, it says, “is contributing to the recent slow growth in health-care prices and spending and is improving quality of care.” As far as Medicare outlays go, there is some evidence to support this argument. Stipulations in the A.C.A. that were aimed at reducing overpayments to medical providers are already having some effect. In the private health-care industry, the main driving force appears to be the trend toward increased cost sharing—i.e., making consumers of health-care services bear more of the costs, largely by raising co-payments and deductibles. When people have to pay forty or fifty dollars to see a doctor instead of ten or twenty, they tend to economize on their visits, and the same goes for diagnostic tests. Going forward, there are parts of the A.C.A. that should help to put additional downward pressure on over-all spending, in both the public and private sectors. Medicare potentially plays a big role here. In many parts of the health-care industry, the remuneration rates that Medicare sets are the starting point for negotiations between private providers and insurers in the private sector. If Medicare makes economies, they often “spill over” into the private sector, the C.E.A. report says, generating additional savings, and it cites various empirical studies to back up its argument. Outside of Medicare, the cost-saving features of the A.C.A. include taxes on so-called “Cadillac plans,” which are designed to encourage employers to choose cheaper options, and new regulations forcing insurers to pay for preventative care, which reduces health-care outlays over the long haul. For the next few years, at least, these cost savings will be offset by a big jump in the number of people who have access to private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare. That’s good news, not bad news: it means that many fewer Americans will be without coverage. Nevertheless, one of the concerns that I have had about Obamacare was that the cost of the reforms, and particularly those parts that fall upon the federal government, would turn out to be substantially bigger than expected. The recent moderation in spending growth has alleviated some of these worries. If it turns out to be a permanent development, and the structural reforms contained in the A.C.A. succeed in reinforcing the trend, America’s health-care challenge could turn out to be more manageable than anybody thought a few years ago. And that, potentially, is huge news. Photograph by Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast.

Will Darrell Issa’s Healthcare.gov Witch Hunt Save Obama?,9283,"When President Obama looked in the mirror on Wednesday morning, he must have wondered whether things could get any worse for the limber, graying fellow staring back at him. According to one new poll, his approval rating had hit a new low; his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, had joined the chorus criticizing him for misleading the American people about keeping their existing health-care policies; the Washington Post was reporting that healthcare.gov, the benighted Web site that is the source of most of his problems, won’t be fully fixed by the end of the month—something the White House had promised a few weeks ago; and Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was about to announce that fewer than twenty seven thousand people have enrolled in new insurance plans through the federal online exchange. The situation is dire, all right—arguably the worst moment of Obama’s five-year tenure. But the Hawaiian Houdini still has one thing going for him, and that’s the uncanny tendency of some of his Republican enemies to turn opportunities into calamities. And none is more adept at this party trick than Darrell Edward Issa, the San Diego loudmouth whose House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a public hearing today, which backfired almost immediately. When your opponent is digging himself into a hole, an elementary rule of politics states, you should stand aside and let him get on with it. But rather than allowing the American public to reach its own conclusions about the troubled rollout of Obamacare, something many already appear to be doing, and to the President’s cost, Issa and some of his G.O.P. colleagues seem intent on launching another partisan witch hunt, one that demeans both sides and diverts attention from the real issues. The hearing began with Issa making the legitimate argument that the Obama Administration, in rolling out a deeply flawed healthcare.gov, made a “monumental mistake to go live and effectively explode on the launch pad.” But rather than pursuing the charge of incompetence, one that even the President’s most dogged defenders might have difficulty knocking down, the Californian congressman quickly moved on to accusing two previously anonymous public servants of withholding information, misleading the public, and carrying water for the President and his lackeys. The dangers in pursuing this strategy immediately became obvious. Neither of the targets of Issa’s questioning—Todd Park, the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Henry Chao, a senior official at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (C.M.S.), the agency in charge of healthcare.gov—looked anything like political hacks. Two calm and well-spoken Asian-Americans, they appeared to be what they are: non-partisan technology experts who have been working night and day since October 1st to get the insurance exchange working properly. And it wasn’t just a matter of appearances. The testimony that Park and Chao presented didn’t do Issa any favors, either. Whereas he and his colleagues have been striving to portray the Web site as an unmitigated disaster, the two witnesses suggested that while it still has some serious problems—they were pretty open about that—it is steadily getting better: the system’s volume capacity has been greatly increased; response times for loading pages are down; and the registration system, which caused a lot of problems at the beginning, has been largely fixed. This wasn’t at all what Issa wanted to hear. Claiming to have “come out of the I.T. world”—before entering politics, he successfully ran several firms that made car alarms and other electronic devices—he repeatedly pressed Park to admit something the Administration has already more or less conceded: in the early hours of October 1st, the system crashed when there were only a small number of people (Issa’s figure was eleven hundred) using it. Turning to Chao, Issa pursued a charge he has been making for more than a month—namely, that the online insurance exchange crashed in part because the White House, fearful of Americans getting “sticker shock” when they saw the prices attached to new policies, ordered C.M.S. to delete a feature that had allowed users to shop around for policies without registering their name and personal details. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? Park, an articulate, youthful-looking forty-year-old who became the Administration’s chief technology officer in March, 2012, was a particularly impressive witness. He was named a Presidential Scholar the year he graduated from high school; he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude; and, after a spell working for the consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton, he founded two technology companies of his own. In response to prompting from Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, he confirmed that one of his former business partners is a second cousin of George W. Bush, and that, over the past few weeks, he has been sleeping in his office. “I’m the son of immigrants from South Korea,” Park said. “I love this country.” If a Hollywood agent hasn’t already signed him up for a starring role in “How I Saved Obamacare,” there are probably several on their way to Washington right now. Wisely, Park didn’t try to downplay the problems healthcare.gov has experienced. Initially, the site had been overwhelmed by volume, he said, and although this problem had been addressed, there were other outstanding issues related to its functionality and stability. However, he insisted, “it’s getting better by the week. Some days are better than others, but if you look at the trend line it is getting better.” As examples, he pointed to the fact that Web pages are now launching in one second rather than eight seconds, on average, and the registration system can handle as many as seventeen thousand registrations an hour. “People can get through the front door and start shopping.” Chao, a stouter and older fellow who has worked for C.M.S. for almost twenty years, was less voluble but still pretty effective in knocking down Issa’s conspiracy theories. During more than eight hours of testimony that he gave to the committee’s investigators before the hearing, Chao said that the reason C.M.S. deleted the shop-around option from healthcare.gov was that it failed in testing. Issa, holding up some documents he said he had obtained from a technology vendor, essentially accused Chao of lying. “It passed the test,” he declared. “You said under oath it failed the test.” Chao held his ground, and, under questioning from Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia, he flatly denied Issa’s main charge. Asked whether anybody at the White House was involved in the decision to delete the shopping option, he said, “Absolutely not. It was a decision made on the results of testing.” As the hearing continued, Issa and his G.O.P. colleagues kept going at it, pointing, among other things, to the rising cost of the insurance exchange, the prior warnings the Administration had received about its workability, and its possible vulnerability to hackers. But some of the tension had already gone out of the proceedings. As was the case with Issa’s frantic pursuits of previous “scandals” involving the Obama Administration—notably Benghazi, Solyndra, and the “Fast and Furious” program—the congressman had failed to back up his headline-grabbing charges with any real evidence, and only succeeded in turning the hearing into another dispiriting spectacle. Across town at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an embattled President had, for the first time in a good while, reason to smile. The political storm about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act is far from over, as indicated by the reaction to Sebelius’s announcement that just twenty-six thousand seven hundred and ninety-four people have signed up for new insurance policies through healthcare.gov, and another seventy-nine thousand three hundred and ninety-one have enrolled through the state exchanges. On Twitter, one wag noted that more people have signed up to name the panda cub at the National Zoo. John Boehner said the low figures showed that the Administration should allow people to keep their current plans. Come December 1st, should healthcare.gov still not be working properly, Obama’s approval ratings will surely sink even lower. But if the Republicans follow Issa’s script, and insist on turning the entire thing into just another partisan wrangle—the sort that sends voters clutching for the off button—all might not be lost.

Obstructing Obamacare’s Navigators,9814,"On August 15th, Jodi Ray, a project director at Florida Covering Kids and Families, a University of South Florida program that works to get uninsured children access to health care, won a federal grant to hire ninety people as health-care “navigators”: workers who will help applicants apply for insurance through the exchanges set up as part of the Affordable Care Act. In states that declined to set up their own exchanges, like Florida, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded funding worth sixty-seven million dollars for outreach efforts to help the uninsured enroll through the federal marketplace. Nearly four million people in Florida are uninsured—the third highest figure in the country—and Ray had six weeks to recruit staff from community-service groups in sixty-four counties across the state, and guide new hires through twenty hours of online federal training attached to her grant. “But our navigators don’t only have to comply with federal requirements for the training,” Ray said. “We have state requirements that we have to comply with, too.” Last spring, the Florida legislature, apparently concerned that swindlers would land jobs as health-care experts with access Social Security numbers and tax information, decided that the navigators should undergo fingerprinting and criminal background checks, and barred them from visiting state-run health clinics. Ray preferred not to comment on what the advocacy group Healthcare For America Now calls “navigator-suppression measures.” She only said, “I’m keeping my head down, the noise out, and focussing on what we are supposed to be doing.” After the government shutdown ended, attention shifted to the blips and seizures bedevilling the federal marketplace’s Web site, healthcare.gov. Thirty-four states, all but seven of them Republican-controlled, chose not to set up their own exchanges, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in outreach funding on the table, and forcing their residents onto the federally-operated Web site at the center of the current uproar. Twenty-one of those states are also expected to refuse nearly three hundred billion dollars in federal funding to expand Medicaid coverage over the next decade, which would have extended care to more than six million people; a majority of those excluded will likely be African-Americans and single mothers. To compound the effects of their recalcitrance, conservative governors, state legislators, and members of Congress have also passed navigator-suppression measures in thirteen states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin—home to seventeen million people without insurance who are eligible for coverage under the A.C.A. Two weeks after Ray received her grant, she was notified by the House Energy and Commerce Committee that she would have to participate in a phone interview with the committee’s staff in September; she was also asked to give written answers to half a dozen questions from the committee and provide “all documentation and communication related to your Navigator grant.” Similar notifications were sent to navigator offices in eleven of the most underinsured states in which residents will need to use the federal health-care exhange—including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, home to about a quarter of the nation’s uninsured. Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, protested, in an open letter to the committee’s chairman, Michigan Republican Fred Upton, that the requests appeared “to have been sent solely to divert the resources of small, local community groups, just as they are needed to help with the new health care law.” On September 18th, Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released a report that singled out Florida as the site of “numerous reports of scam artists posing as navigators and Assisters to take advantage of people’s confusion about ObamaCare.” On October 2nd, Fox News aired footage of volunteers for Get Covered America, a non-profit advocacy campaign, going door-to-door in a Miami suburb to distribute flyers about the new insurance marketplace—but wrongly identified them as federally-funded navigators, giving the impression that these “navigators” were hawking plans like pushy insurance salesmen. Upton linked to the report on his Web site. Ray, who still spends much of her time getting new navigators licensed while the federal government fixes the Web site’s glitches, was reticent about discussing the maelstrom of controversy. “It’s been busy,” she said. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? As these tactics jam up early efforts in many states, they also amplify the contrast with successful rollouts in states that have wholeheartedly embraced the new law, like Colorado, Connecticut, New York, Kentucky, and Washington. Elisabeth Benjamin, who leads New York’s largest team of navigators at the Community Service Society, spent much her early career improving health-care capacity in developing countries like India, Tunisia, and postwar Iraq—where, she said, people often told her, “I don’t understand why you’re in our country. You have a lot of problems with health care and poor people in your country.” Back home, she started a health-law unit at the Legal Aid Society to assist low-income New Yorkers with unforgiving medical bills. In 2008, she unveiled an insurance ombudsman program at C.S.S. to help people at every income level understand their options for medical coverage. “If you need a loaf of bread, it’s a buck,” she said, explaining health care’s central distinction from other forms of assistance. “If you need a transplant, it’s five hundred thousand dollars.” Around the same time Benjamin was starting her program, Eliot Spitzer, then the governor of New York, proposed statewide health-care reform similar to the law Massachusetts had passed four years earlier. Vermont’s legislature had expanded coverage, and Arnold Schwarzenegger had made national news by calling for a similar program in California. Benjamin joined an affordable-health-care advocacy campaign, Healthcare for All New York, and testified before the New York State Legislature. “We just assumed there would be a state-by-state movement to extend coverage,” Benjamin said. But two years later, the Obama Administration, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House and Senate, passed the Affordable Care Act. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, along with the state legislature in Albany, accepted the expansion of Medicaid, and the state established its own online exchange. After the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare, in June, 2012, Cuomo released a statement that said, “We look forward to continuing to work together with the Obama administration to ensure accessible, quality care for all New Yorkers.” That spirit of coöperation has been integral to New York’s early success. Elisabeth Benjamin, in New York, and Jodi Ray, in Florida, offer exactly the same services to people who were previously unable to obtain medical coverage: they help determine voucher amounts, parse available options, and submit applications online, over the phone, or through the mail. But because New York set up its own exchange, the state received twenty-seven million dollars to fund its navigators, while Florida has just eight million dollars for outreach. Benjamin, who is herself a trained navigator, conceded that there were glitches on New York’s Web site the first week, but said that most of them have been resolved. In the second week, she helped enroll a woman who had worked as a home-health-care aid for twenty years, earning around twenty-four thousand dollars annually. Home health care “has to be the hardest job in America—so physically taxing and emotionally draining,” Benjamin said. “And we don’t give them health coverage. Are you kidding me? They’re part of the health-care system.” Benjamin helped find a plan for the woman that costs seventy-two dollars a month. “I was crying,” Benjamin said. “That’s what it’s all about.” For the A.C.A. to succeed in its goal of providing coverage for all citizens at an overall reduction in cost, a critical mass of people—old and young, sick and healthy—will need to participate in the insurance exchanges. As of October 23rd, New York had enrolled thirty-seven thousand people, more than twice the goal set by H.H.S. for the entire month of October. Florida won’t know how many people have enrolled until H.H.S. releases its figures sometime in November. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a total of seven million people nationwide could enroll in the first year. But Dr. Kavita Patel, a health-care-reform expert at the Brookings Institution, and a former policy advisor in the Obama Administration, told me, “If by the end of 2014 there are three million people enrolled, that would be a success.” The politicians who are currently bemoaning the looming failure of Obamacare might consider doing more to help navigators like Jodi Ray make it work.

Healthcare.gov: It Could Be Worse,9433,"On October 1st, the first day of the government shutdown, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched Healthcare.gov, a four-hundred-million-dollar online marketplace designed to help Americans research and purchase health insurance. In its first days, only a small fraction of users could create an account or log in. The problems were initially attributed to high demand. But as days turned into weeks, Healthcare.gov’s troubles only seemed to multiply. Reports appeared of applications freezing half-completed and of the system “putting users in inescapable loops, and miscalculating healthcare subsidies.” Politico reported that “Web brokers … have been unable to connect to the federal system.” Healthcare.gov is the public face of the Obama Administration’s signature policy achievement, and its launch has been widely derided as a disaster. But it could have been worse. On September 11, 2001, the F.B.I. was still using a computer system that couldn’t store or display pictures; entering data was time-consuming and awkward, and retrieving it even more so. A 9/11 Commission staff report concluded that “the FBI’s primary information management system, designed using 1980s technology already obsolete when installed in 1995, limited the Bureau’s ability to share its information internally and externally.” But an overhaul of that system had already begun in the months leading up to 9/11. In June, 2001, the F.B.I. awarded the contractor Science Applications International Corp. (S.A.I.C.) a fourteen-million-dollar contract to upgrade the F.B.I.’s computer systems. The project was called Virtual Case File, or V.C.F., and it would ultimately cost over six hundred million dollars before finally being abandoned, in early 2005, unfinished and never deployed. V.C.F. was then replaced with a project called Sentinel, expected to launch in 2009, which was “designed to be everything V.C.F. was not, with specific requirements, regular milestones and aggressive oversight,” according to F.B.I. officials who spoke to the Washington Post in 2006. But by 2010, Sentinel was also being described as “troubled,” and only two out of a planned four phases had been completed. Sentinel was finally deployed on July 1, 2012, after the F.B.I. took over the project from the contractor Lockheed-Martin in 2010, bringing it in-house for completion—at an ultimate cost of at least four hundred and fifty-one million dollars. In the end, the upgrade took the F.B.I. more than a decade and over a billion dollars. Healthcare.gov is not so much a Web site as an interface for accessing a collection of databases and information systems. Behind the nicely designed Web forms are systems to create accounts, manage user logins, and collect insurance-application data. There’s a part that determines subsidy eligibility, a part that sends applications to the right insurance company, and other parts that glue these things together. Picture the dashboard of your car, which has a few knobs and buttons, some switches, and a big wheel—simple controls for a lot of complex machinery under the hood. All of these systems, whether in your car or on Healthcare.gov, have to communicate the right information at the right time for any of it to work properly. In the case of Healthcare.gov, we don’t know what precisely has gone wrong, because the system isn’t open-source—meaning the code used to build it isn’t available for anyone to see—and nobody involved has released technical information. But the multiple databases and subsystems are probably distributed all over the country, written in a variety of computer languages, and handle data in very different ways. Some are brand new, others are old. For large software projects, failure is generally determined early in the process, because failures almost exclusively have to do with planning: the failure to create a workable plan, to stick to it, or both. Healthcare.gov reportedly involved over fifty-five contractors, managed by a human-services agency that lacked deep experience in software engineering or project management. The final product had to be powerful enough to navigate any American through a complex array of different insurance offerings, secure enough to hold sensitive private data, and robust enough to withstand peak traffic in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of concurrent users. It also had to be simple enough so that anyone who can open a Web browser could use it. In complexity, this is a project on par with the F.B.I.’s V.C.F. or Sentinel. The number and variety of systems to be connected may not be quite as large, but the interface had to be usable by anyone, without special training. And, unlike V.C.F., Healthcare.gov was given only twenty-two months from contract award to launch—less than two years for a project similar to one that took the F.B.I. more than ten years and over twice the budget. Early in a project, there is a phase in which the client and the contractor work together to create a description of what is to be built. This is called the specification, and building a complex software product without a clear, fixed set of specifications is impossible. The Times reported that the biggest contractor, CGI Federal, was awarded its $94 million contract in December 2011. But the government was so slow in issuing specifications that the firm did not start writing software code until this spring…. As late as the last week of September, officials were still changing features of the Web site. This is like being told to build a skyscraper without any blueprints, while the client keeps changing the desired location of things like plumbing and wiring. The Times also quoted an “insurance executive working on information technology,” who said that “we foresee a train wreck” because “we don’t have the I.T. specifications.” He also said that “the political people in the administration do not understand how far behind they are.” I’ve been a software contractor for the better part of fifteen years, and no one spends that long developing software without being involved in a few troubled projects. One thing they all have in common is that “train wrecks” are never a surprise to anyone working on them. They are not discrete events; they are part of drawn out processes. We only saw the wreckage of Healthcare.gov on October 1st, but the contractors have been working on a wreck for almost two years. A blog post on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Web site, in a section titled “Tech Surge,” reads, in part: Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov. Speaking in the Rose Garden this morning, President Obama acknowledged the problems with Healthcare.gov, but said that “the Web site’s gonna get fixed.” He echoed the “surge” language in his statement, saying, “We’ve got people working overtime, twenty-four-seven to boost capacity and address the problems…. We’ve had some of the best I.T. talent in the entire country join the team, and we’re well into a tech surge to fix the problem.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Can a “tech surge” work? In his seminal book on software project management, “The Mythical Man-Month,” Fred Brooks writes that “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.” This is known as Brooks’s Law, and it is taken as gospel by programmers because it is usually true: it takes so much time for new coders to comprehend the system that they’re supposed to be fixing that typically it would have been faster not to include them at all. In this case, though, there is some chance that a surge will work: the project is already made of discrete parts that could be improved by many teams working in parallel. I signed up for an account on Healthcare.gov last week. It wasn’t the smoothest process, but I was able to create an account. Some parts are slow; sometimes you have to reload a page to make progress. But it’s starting to work. It will be fixed, because it has to be. And now that the launch and inevitable crash has finally happened, in a way the worst is over. Real-world traffic is providing programmers all the debugging data that they could ever want, and “all bugs are shallow with the president watching,” as Paul Ford writes in Bloomberg Businessweek, paraphrasing the open-source-software advocate Eric Raymond’s assertion that “with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” We could hope that the very public scrutiny of this project will lead to better government software-development practices in the future. But the next high-profile federal I.T. disaster is probably already underway. Rusty Foster is a computer programmer and writer who lives in Maine. Illustration by Michael Kupperman.

Behind the Obamacare-Cancellation Scare,5925,"“Healthcare is complicated, and it’s very personal. And it’s easy to scare folks,” Barack Obama said today, in Boston. He started with something more frustrating than frightening: healthcare.gov, the federal insurance-exchange Web site, still isn’t working properly—“and I am not happy about it. And neither are a lot of Americans who need health care.” If they could just get on the site, he said, they would see how good the Affordable Care Act was. He chose Boston for the opportunity to make jokes about the Red Sox’s beards, and also because Massachusetts was a model for why this program, his legacy, would work. There was something else that was scary, though. Obama also had to speak because of what he called the “latest flurry” in the news. It was a little more than that. He had to square something that he had repeated often and unambiguously—“If you like your plan, you can keep your plan”—with the news that people are getting letters from insurance companies saying that their coverage was being cancelled because of the Affordable Care Act. Yesterday, NBC ran a report saying that millions of people would lose their existing coverage. Although the numbers are in dispute, this was not, as Jonathan Cohn and others have noted, a surprise to people deeply versed in the A.C.A. But it was for a lot of people who got those letters. Only certain people are affected. You have to have bought an individual plan (that is, not through employers or as part of a group) since 2010, when the A.C.A. passed, and that plan needs to not meet the minimum requirements for coverage under the A.C.A. It would fail, for example, if it lacks emergency-room or maternity coverage, or imposes crippling out-of-pocket expenses, or the sort of caps that mean people paying premiums end up bankrupt anyway. (If you bought one before 2010, and it hasn’t changed, you can keep it.) Obama called these “cut-rate plans” offered by “bad-apple” insurers. There are between ten and fourteen million people in the individual market. Many have, until now, lived in a precarious state. The health-insurance system in America has been so rotten for so long that losing even a bad plan is deeply frightening—which is why it verges on cruelty for the Administration to not have anticipated and prepared for what, based on press reports, seems to be a wave of cancellation letters. This is all the more so because it has good answers for them. Obama pointed out that, before the A.C.A., insurance companies could, and did, cancel insurance policies at will. Before Obamacare, people with preëxisting conditions often couldn’t get any other insurance. Now people whose plans have been cancelled can generally get better insurance than they had, and (in terms of total costs, not premiums) more cheaply. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? That is true, anyway, if people looking for insurance know that they have that option, and that they don’t have to just accept whatever new premium their old insurer presents them with. Obama complained about reports not making it clear that people whose plans were cancelled had options—“If you get one of these letters, just shop around”—but if they don’t know it, a fair share of the fault lies with the Administration and its lack of clarity. Also, you can’t find out about a new, better plan if you can’t get on that broken Web site. Did Obama think that “if you like your plan” was enough of a qualification, since the “substandard plans,” as he called them, were so manifestly unlikable? That’s not quite good enough. Because of the Administration’s lack of openness—and, really, honesty—the banishing of inadequate, exploitative insurance plans is now a small scandal. In a more perfect Washington and world it ought to have been a point of pride for the White House. Maybe it still can be. A few hours before Obama spoke, Kathleen Sebelius, his Secretary of Health and Human Services, spent three and a half hours testifying before Congress. She apologized for the Web site—“You deserve better. I apologize. I’m accountable to you for fixing these problems”—and, like Obama, tried to explain the economics behind the cancellation letters. There was also a good deal of nonsense in the hearings; this is Congress, after all. Red Solo cups kept coming up—they served as Congresswoman Blackburn’s metaphor for the sort of policies companies can’t sell anymore—and the Wizard of Oz, because Sebelius used to be governor of Kansas. At one point, it felt like a miracle that no one asked about Toto biting Miss Gulch and what that would do for her premiums. And yet we are approaching a stripped-down discussion of what is actually at stake in Obamacare, what has gone wrong (and what the Administration did wrong), and why it was worth it. There is a better sense of how health care in America might actually change. It will not be invisible, and it has already been for the better. There will be a lot of winners. There may be losers, and there is nothing wrong with hoping that certain insurance companies are among them—the ones that, until now, were able to sell predatory plans that looked solid but left people stripped bare financially if they actually became sick. But the President can’t pretend it’s not an honest fight. Photograph by Darren McCollester/Getty. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Political Memo: Is the A.C.A. Rollout a Manageable Disaster?,9757,"In the past half century, the United States has had five Presidents who were elected to two terms in the White House: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. (I’m not counting Lyndon Johnson, who was only voted in once.) All five won reëlection handily, but none of them enjoyed trouble-free second terms—and that’s putting it mildly. At this point in Nixon’s second four years, November of 1973, the Watergate scandal was raging. It took a bit longer for Reagan and Clinton to run into trouble. Eventually, though, both of their second terms were dragged down in embarrassing scandals: the Iran Contra affair and the Monica Lewinksy saga. Bush Jr., unlike his predecessors, managed to escape the attentions of an independent counsel or prosecutor, but the disastrous progress of the war in Iraq did so much damage to his reputation that, according to a new book by Peter Baker, of the Times, he got to the stage where he didn’t know how to react to good news. President Obama’s problems are relatively minor by comparison. Despite the best efforts of the Republicans in Congress to whip up public outrage over the sacking of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, the failure of Solyndra, and the I.R.S. treatment of conservative groups, he has largely escaped the taint of scandal. Today, he stands accused, but the alleged crime is one of incompetence rather than malicious abuse of his office, personal irresponsibility, or warmongering. In botching the launch of his signature policy innovation, the Affordable Care Act, he has presented his opponents with a big, heavy club, which they are wielding enthusiastically over his head. The damage done so far is serious, but it isn’t terminal. According to a number of recent polls, Obama’s approval rating is at or close to its lowest level since he took office. For example, the Gallup daily tracker, a survey that political professionals watch closely, has his approval rating at thirty-nine per cent, and his disapproval rating at fifty-three per cent. In the past few months, his numbers have fallen sharply, and they have now plumbed the depths they reached during the summer of 2011, when he and the Republicans were squabbling over the budget and the debt ceiling. (Back then, Obama’s approval rating in the Gallup poll fell to thirty-eight per cent.) Some of the recent slippage was a consequence of the government shutdown, which damaged both sides (but the Republicans more). However, Obama’s approval rating has fallen six points in a month, which can only be attributed to the A.C.A.’s flawed rollout. In promising all Americans that they could keep their existing insurance policies if they so wished, the President turns out to have communicated a falsehood. In failing to make sure that the Web site for the federal health-insurance marketplace was functioning properly before it opened for business, he added to the perception, already prevalent in some quarters, that he is a bookish and semi-detached college lecturer who couldn’t run a hot-dog stall. And in promising to fix the site, healthcare.gov, by the end of this month, his troubleshooter Jeffrey Zients has created a potential hostage to fortune. If the Web site isn’t working properly on December 1st, the political fallout will be great. In short, it’s a mess—a fact some voices normally supportive of Obama are acknowledging. In a cover story for Business Week entitled “How the iPod President Crashed,” the columnist and blogger Ezra Klein argued that “the disastrous launch of healthcare.gov…has dealt a devastating blow to Obama’s vision” of healthcare transformed, and to the broader notion of activist government. Like Medicare Part D, Klein noted, the A.C.A. could “emerge from a troubled launch to become a wildly successful program. But reviving the idea that government can do big things right will be harder.” The President’s interventions haven’t helped much. At times, he’s appeared to be trying to downplay the problems with the rollout, by, for example, suggesting that there is always a lot of churn in the market for individual insurance, so the fact that millions of Americans will have to give up their existing policies isn’t a big deal. “As if we weren’t quite bright enough to get that,” Jon Meacham commented on Tuesday’s “Morning Joe.” “And I think that that’s part of the issue of his Presidency that people will be talking about for years to come, about his ability to communicate simply and now accurately, but also to really understand that we’re all not quite as slow, perhaps, as he thinks we are.” Perhaps the most damaging charge against Obama is that he didn’t express more interest in the building and testing of healthcare.gov, which, once so many Republican-run states declined to run their own sites, was always going to be the public face of an enormous new government program bearing his name. When well-run corporations make “bet the company” investments on a new product or acquisition, their C.E.O. is usually there to supervise and lead. Even if the C.E.O. stays at HQ, he or she will demand daily briefings and updates. For the Obama Administration, rolling out the A.C.A. was the political equivalent of a bet-the-company investment. But, as far as we can tell, making sure the new Web site was constructed in time and worked properly was, for the most part, left to a largely anonymous, and doubtless overworked, bureaucrat at the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services, Henry Chao. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Clearly, Obama is no Steve Jobs or Lee Iacocca. In his defense, though, presidents have countless other things that occupy their time—from dealing with Congress and Vladimir Putin over Syria to facing down the Republicans over the debt ceiling to having lengthy off-the-record conversations with the likes of David Brooks, Joe Klein, and Tom Friedman. (Who knew he cared so much what columnists write? If he were a true Vulcan technocrat, he wouldn’t give a fig.) The true test of the A.C.A. will come when healthcare.gov and the state-run Web sites are up and running properly. As I’ve said previously, I think the new exchanges, and particularly the generous new subsidies that are available on them, will eventually prove very popular, and Obamacare be a success on its own terms: i.e., it will substantially reduce the number of uninsured. The economics of the reform, as long as the individual and employer mandate are enforced, hang together reasonably well. In the corporate market, not much changes for companies that already offer coverage. In the individual market, a flood of new enrollees improves the risk pool, which allows insurers to bring down prices. In New York, for example, which already has community rating and mandatory coverage for people with preëxisting conditions, prices for individual policies will fall by as much as forty per cent. (I got that figure from the online health-cost calculator of the conservative Manhattan Institute.) In states where insurers were previously selling policies with high deductibles and big exclusions, and discriminating against high-risk groups, premiums will rise, at least initially, especially for young purchasers. In Oklahoma, for example, a twenty-seven-year-old male will have to pay fifty-one per cent more for a policy, but a sixty-four-year-old male will receive a price cut of sixteen per cent. (These figures also came from the Manhattan Institute.) The key to success is to get all the different parts of the A.C.A. working together: the mandates, the exchanges, and the new regulations for insurers. So far, of course, this is precisely what hasn’t happened. The employer mandate has been put back; the national exchange has proved a dud, and its failings are affecting some of the state exchanges, which need to get information from the federal government; the new regulations, which set minimum standards for all insurance policies, are causing some sticker shock. And with the reform stalled, so is the big promotional campaign that was supposed to persuade young people to sign up. Obviously, much depends on the efforts of Zients and the team of whizzes he has recruited for his “tech surge.” If they can get healthcare.gov working properly on the timetable they have laid down, this will probably prove to be a crisis that Obama can rebound from—something like the budget crisis of 2011. The number of people enrolled on the exchanges will rise sharply, reporters will find some people who are happy with their new policies, and the news cycle will move on. If, however, the technical problems persist into December and the new year, the A.C.A. saga will take on some aspects of the scandals that did so much damage to previous two-term presidents. There will be more congressional hearings and damaging news stories; the internal recriminations will begin; and Obama’s approval rating will continue to slide. For a President who, less than three weeks ago, seemed to have routed his G.O.P. opponents, it’s a damnable spot to be in. No wonder he looks irritable. Photograph by Evan Vucci/AP.

Why Congressional Staffers Hate the Vitter Amendment,11242,"Tonight, the House of Representatives will likely vote on the so-called Vitter Amendment, a bill that will be attached to a debt-ceiling increase and a continuing resolution to re-open the government. The Vitter Amendment would take away health-care subsidies for Congressional staffers. Via Twitter, I asked Congressional aides for their feelings about the bill. Here’s what they e-mailed me. We’ll update as new comments roll in. A House Republican staffer: It’s definitely a morale killer. We’ve been dealing with stagnant pay, long hours—including weekends and federal holidays—but hey, at least we have good benefits. This will suck. I know the public doesn’t have much sympathy, but these are not easy jobs. If they hate Congress, imagine working for it. That said, I can understand the rationale and strategy in embracing the amendment and I don’t resent the Members who are pushing it. They know full well they’ll have to deal with the consequences. A Senate Republican staffer: I’ve been a staffer in a republican Senate office for 8 years. It’s extremely frustrating to have Vitter portray the employer contribution as some sort of exemption from the exchanges. My healthcare costs are already going to sky rocket, but being responsible for 100% of my premiums just isn’t realistic on my salary. I know I’m not the only staffer looking for a job off the hill because I knew this was a possibility. I can only assume the poor staff having to write the amendment language are hopefully throwing death glares at Vitter. A Senate Democratic staffer: You’ve got to be fucking kidding me with this. Wouldn’t the Vitter amendment lead to an actual exemption for Congress? If Congress, as an institution employing thousands of workers, did not contribute to its employees’ health care like most companies do, isn’t that an exemption? Maybe not an exemption under law per se, but an exemption according to standard practice. Either way, if that somehow makes its way through, I’ll be looking for another job. Congrats Tea Party, your eternal quest to starve the beast is chugging along full steam ahead! A House Democratic staffer: My anonymous thought as a Democratic staffer is that it’s going to be another awkward night in The People’s House, watching Republican staffers as they watch their bosses argue for stripping away their employer health care contribution from their already meager salary. I almost feel bad for the staffers … which is saying a lot, given the way the Majority has conducted itself. A Senate intern: I’m a senior in college, currently a paid intern in the Senate. The Vitter Amendment disgusts me. Already I fear younger people like me, pessimistic about the efficacy of government, will steer away from jobs in the public sector. And many of us even somewhat politically aware understand that staffers are overworked and underpaid. However, the allure is that you get to do something good, and in a sense, serve your country. But adding the burden of providing for my own health care is a bridge too far. In an already stalemated Congress, there are few incentives that outweigh that burden. The entrenched pessimism on the part of people my age scares me. We may not have faith in government but to change it we have little choice but to participate. That means voting, working in government or even holding office. But what are the incentives now? I know that people my age would be able to fix this. My concern is none of us would choose to be in any position to solve it in first place A House Democratic staffer: Please PLEASE keep me anonymous!! I will make $22,800 this year after taxes. That is it. I am a 30 year old married congressional staffer with a 20 month old son who depends on my job for his health insurance. My husband has to pay for his own health care through his salary, and it would cost him over $1000 a month to cover the whole family. I just started in this position 6 months ago, after being out of work for a year and staying at home with my baby. I need my health insurance, and I cannot afford to pay $600 a month for coverage. Without this so called “subsidy” (the same “subsidy” congressional staffers have been receiving for years before the ACA) both myself and my son will be uninsured. With our combined salaries, my husband and I will not qualify for subsidies via the ACA, so we would have to pay for it all out of pocket. I am not “entitled.” I am not a leech. I work. I pay bills. And my husband and I are trying to raise our son as well as possible. I lead a simple, middle class lifestyle. I am not riding high on the hog in any capacity. And neither are any of my co-workers. So I don’t know why we are being targeted. The congressperson I work for is married to a doctor, so they are set. They can pay for their health insurance without a “subsidy.” I can’t afford to. If I cannot receive the same assistance from my employer as the majority of Americans who get healthcare through their employer, I will be priced out of health care … Sincerely, an ANONYMOUS congressional staffer who is tired of being a political punching bag… A House Republican staffer: For those congressional staffers saying they agree and support their bosses call for the Vitter amendment, which is a major morale killer and kick in the gut to staff, all I have to say iS stop drinking [the Koolaid]. A House Democratic staffer: I’m Legislative Director for [a Democratic Member of the House]. I guess what I find most outrageous about the Vitter Amendment is that it most hurts the youngest, least well paid staff who already make 25-35k a year in one of the most expensive cities in the country. We have several who fit that description in my office—they all went to top schools, got sterling GPAs, have awesome resumes that could get them hired at an Investment Bank or anywhere else, but they came here to try to make a difference. I make a somewhat healthier salary, and I’m married so I can hop on my wife’s insurance if necessary. But they don’t have those options. We’ll do what we can to make them whole if Vitter becomes law, but most offices won’t—especially on the R side. They’ll just ask another group of 22-25 year olds who came here for the right reasons to live on $20k a year. And they’ll get them to do it, but they’ll be less qualified, less intelligent, and they’ll be looking for the exit almost immediately. It’s especially galling since they also could achieve the exact same purpose of being able to tell their base that they repealed Congress’s fake exemption from ACA by the “Vitter-lite” proposal which would only hit Members, and not staff. That they apparently decided that wasn’t good enough leads me to the conclusion that screwing staff is a feature, not a bug. The GOP would like to hollow out Congress, just as they have tried to do to many other federal agencies. The only thing better than getting rid of a federal agency is keeping it on life support, while the political hacks take their swings at it. It’s short-sighted, it’s cruel, it’s unnecessary. I just don’t get it. A House Democratic staffer: What none of us on the D side have been able to figure out is, how can a self-respecting GOP staffer stand by their boss who is trying to stick it to them? Fine, Members are different for a lot of reasons—and if they want to vote to take away their own employer contribution, ok. But as a staffer, to be complicit in or even cheerleading your own five-figure pay cut? I can’t possibly imagine the source of the self-loathing behind that. We stick with our bosses out of loyalty a lot—through sex scandals, campaign finance violations, shady land deals, whatever. We do it because they have given us a shot at being part of something we believe in, we have become believers in them along the way, and politics always has an us-against-them undertone anyway. But those scandals almost never involve the staff directly, so standing by your man doesn’t amount to self-flagellation. This, however, is a direct assault on staff. How do you stand there and take it? Not only that, but how do you go out and promote it as if you’re fighting for some kind of justice? Pity the poor legislative counsel who is drafting this thing right now gritting thorough that forced nonpartisan smile. A former Republican staffer: As a former GOP Chief, this sucks for staff. You’re now essentially saying we shutdown the government and threatened the full faith and credit of the United States just so that we can screw our underpaid, overworked, under-appreciated staff. It’s a big middle finger to folks who give up their entire lives for what is now a very crappy job. Some offices may have the ability to help staffers mitigate the new expense by moving things around in the MRA, but most offices won’t have that flexibility as we’ve also been cutting congressional staff budgets consistently too. I’d think the brain drain on the Hill will likely be quick and dramatic over the next year if this becomes law. Congrats intern, you’re the new LD! A chief of staff to a Democratic member of the House: I am a Democratic House Chief of Staff w/ 17 years of Hill experience. I have 2 children, including one son with health problems. I have not gotten a COLA in 2 years (nor has anyone on my staff), and there’s little chance of that changing anytime soon. My husband is a partner in a law firm, so we are certainly more fortunate than many Hill staffers in terms of combined income (though his income has decreased each of the past 3 years due to the poor economy). But as a partner he has no employer subsidy for health insurance, so we have always depended on mine, and it’s a pretty significant reason I’ve stayed on the Hill all these years. I can guarantee you that if our subsidy were taken away, I would immediately start looking for work in the private sector. I have absolutely no problem with participating in the health exchanges—this is, as many have pointed out, not about Obamacare. But there is no way I could stay in this job indefinitely if I had to shoulder the entire burden of my family’s health care. I care deeply about Congress and have always felt extremely privileged to work here and more than willing to sacrifice the higher pay, better hours and other perks I might find off the Hill. But there’s a limit to what we can absorb, and I know I speak for a great many of my colleagues. I am proud, at least, that my boss recognizes how crazy and mean-spirited it is to treat Congressional staff this way, and I am grateful that he’s willing to take a tough vote on Vitter for the sake of his employees.

Where the G.O.P.&#39;s Suicide Caucus Lives,8099,"The geography of Congress’s so-called suicide caucus. Click to expand. On August 21st, Congressman Mark Meadows sent a letter to John Boehner. Meadows is a former restaurant owner and Sunday-school Bible teacher from North Carolina. He’s been in Congress for eight months. Boehner, who has served in Congress for twenty-two years, is the Speaker of the House and second in the line of succession if anything happened to the President. Meadows was not pleased with how Boehner and his fellow Republican leaders in the House were approaching the September fight over spending. The annual appropriations to fund the government were scheduled to run out on October 1st, and much of it would stop operating unless Congress passed a new law. Meadows wanted Boehner to use the threat of a government shutdown to defund Obamacare, a course Boehner had publicly ruled out. Back home in Meadows’s congressional district, the idea was quite popular. North Carolina’s Eleventh District had been gerrymandered after the 2010 census to become the most Republican district in his state. Meadows won his election last November by fifteen points. The Presidential contest there was an even bigger blowout. Romney won the district by twenty-three points, sixty-one per cent to thirty-eight per cent. While the big story of the 2012 election was about demographics and a growing non-white population that is increasingly Democratic, that was not the story in the Meadows race. His district is eighty-seven per cent white, five per cent Latino, and three per cent black. Before Meadows sent off his letter to Boehner, he circulated it among his colleagues, and with the help of the conservative group FreedomWorks, as well as some heavy campaigning by Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Mike Lee, seventy-nine like-minded House Republicans from districts very similar to Meadows’s added their signatures. “Since most of the citizens we represent believe that ObamaCare should never go into effect,” the letter said, “we urge you to affirmatively de-fund the implementation and enforcement of ObamaCare in any relevant appropriations bill brought to the House floor in the 113th Congress, including any continuing appropriations bill.” They ended the letter with a stirring reference to Madison: Not everyone thought it was a terrific idea or one worthy of comparison to the brilliance of the Founders. Noting the strategic ineptness of threatening a government shutdown over a policy that neither the Democratically controlled Senate nor the President himself would ever support, Karl Rove railed against the idea in the Wall Street Journal. The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer dubbed the eighty Republicans the “suicide caucus.” And yet, a few weeks later, Boehner adopted the course demanded by Meadows and his colleagues. The ability of eighty members of the House of Representatives to push the Republican Party into a strategic course that is condemned by the party’s top strategists is a historical oddity. It’s especially strange when you consider some of the numbers behind the suicide caucus. As we approach a likely government shutdown this month and then a more perilous fight over raising the debt ceiling in October, it’s worth considering the demographics and geography of the eighty districts whose members have steered national policy over the past few weeks. As the above map, detailing the geography of the suicide caucus, shows, half of these districts are concentrated in the South, and a quarter of them are in the Midwest, while there’s a smattering of thirteen in the rural West and four in rural Pennsylvania (outside the population centers of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh). Naturally, there are no members from New England, the megalopolis corridor from Washington to Boston, or along the Pacific coastline. These eighty members represent just eighteen per cent of the House and just a third of the two hundred and thirty-three House Republicans. They were elected with fourteen and a half million of the hundred and eighteen million votes cast in House elections last November, or twelve per cent of the total. In all, they represent fifty-eight million constituents. That may sound like a lot, but it’s just eighteen per cent of the population. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Most of the members of the suicide caucus have districts very similar to Meadows’s. While the most salient demographic fact about America is that it is becoming more diverse, Republican districts actually became less diverse in 2012. According to figures compiled by The Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman, a leading expert on House demographics who provided me with most of the raw data I’ve used here, the average House Republican district became two percentage points more white in 2012. The members of the suicide caucus live in a different America from the one that most political commentators describe when talking about how the country is transforming. The average suicide-caucus district is seventy-five per cent white, while the average House district is sixty-three per cent white. Latinos make up an average of nine per cent of suicide-district residents, while the over-all average is seventeen per cent. The districts also have slightly lower levels of education (twenty-five per cent of the population in suicide districts have college degrees, while that number is twenty-nine per cent for the average district). The members themselves represent this lack of diversity. Seventy-six of the members who signed the Meadows letter are male. Seventy-nine of them are white. As with Meadows, the other suicide-caucus members live in places where the national election results seem like an anomaly. Obama defeated Romney by four points nationally. But in the eighty suicide-caucus districts, Obama lost to Romney by an average of twenty-three points. The Republican members themselves did even better. In these eighty districts, the average margin of victory for the Republican candidate was thirty-four points. In short, these eighty members represent an America where the population is getting whiter, where there are few major cities, where Obama lost the last election in a landslide, and where the Republican Party is becoming more dominant and more popular. Meanwhile, in national politics, each of these trends is actually reversed. In one sense, these eighty members are acting rationally. They seem to be pushing policies that are representative of what their constituents back home want. But even within the broader Republican Party, they represent a minority view, at least at the level of tactics (almost all Republicans want to defund Obamacare, even if they disagree about using the issue to threaten a government shutdown). In previous eras, ideologically extreme minorities could be controlled by party leadership. What’s new about the current House of Representatives is that party discipline has broken down on the Republican side. On the most important policy questions, ones that most affect the national brand of the party, Boehner has lost his ability to control his caucus, and an ideological faction, aided by outside interest groups, can now set the national agenda. Through redistricting, Republicans have built themselves a perhaps unbreakable majority in the House. But it has come at a cost of both party discipline and national popularity. Nowadays, a Sunday-school teacher can defeat the will of the Speaker of the House. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Why Is No One On the First Treatment To Prevent H.I.V.?,15919,"In November, 2010, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a three-year clinical trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health, announcing the arrival of a treatment that could reduce the risk of contracting H.I.V. by more than ninety per cent. The treatment involved a blue, oval pill containing emtricitabine and tenofovir. Marketed under the brand name Truvada, the pill was synthesized in 2004 by Gilead Sciences, the world’s largest producer of branded H.I.V. drugs, and has been used in combination with other antiretrovirals as a primary treatment for people living with aids. The N.I.H. team discovered that a daily dose of Truvada not only suppressed the virus in people who were already infected but also prevented healthy people from contracting H.I.V. in the first place. Following the N.I.H. study, which tracked gay men in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States, additional trials showed the drug to be effective for heterosexual men and women, as well as for injection-drug users. Researchers called the treatment “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP for short. Others have called it “the new condom.” On the day the N.I.H. announced the results of the PrEP study, the research team received a congratulatory phone call from President Obama. Shortly thereafter, Time put PrEP in the first slot on its list of the year’s top medical innovations. Dr. Robert Grant, a professor at the University of California San Francisco and the N.I.H. study’s lead scientist, braced for a stampede. He told me, “The evening before we announced, we had meetings with the leadership of public health in California, and they were thinking, as we were, that there was going to be a rush, that everyone was going to descend on the clinics.” The Centers for Disease Control issued interim usage guidelines, despite the fact that the treatment was more than a year away from formal F.D.A. approval. The C.D.C. knew that some doctors were already prescribing Truvada for prevention off-label, and it expected more to follow suit. But, in fact, adoption of the drug has been slow. According to Dawn Smith, a biomedical interventions implementation officer in the C.D.C.’s epidemiology branch, at least half a million Americans are good candidates for PrEP—meaning that they are at high risk for contracting H.I.V. through sexual activity—yet only a few thousand Americans are receiving the treatment. “As in most fields, many clinicians don’t want to be the first one out of the gate,” Smith said. Salim Karim, the chair of United Nations’ aids Scientific Expert Panel and the director of the Centre for the aids Programme of Research in South Africa, thinks that doctors’ hesitance may not have anything to do with sexual health. “Clinicians fundamentally have difficulty giving healthy people drugs,” he said. “This is not unique to H.I.V.” Meanwhile, despite repeated demonstrations that Truvada provides protection from H.I.V., an estimated hundred and fifty thousand Americans, more than a third of whom are in their teens and twenties, have become infected with the virus since the results of the study were released. The medical community’s reluctance to prescribe Truvada—and patients’ reluctance to request it—also stems from a bitter fight over the treatment. Critics have questioned PrEP’s safety, efficacy, and cost, and have accused the government of colluding with the drug manufacturer at the expense of public health. Regan Hofmann, the former editor-in-chief of Poz, a magazine for people living with aids, called PrEP a “profit-driven sex toy for rich Westerners.” Michael Weinstein, the head of the aids Healthcare Foundation (A.H.F.), the world’s largest aids organization and the primary-care provider for more than two hundred thousand patients around the world, predicted a public-health catastrophe. “The applause for this approach shows just how disposable we consider the lives of gay men,” he wrote. When I interviewed Weinstein, he claimed the studies were “rigged” and that PrEP was essentially a plot by Gilead to force young people into buying unnecessary medication, and that it was going badly because A.H.F. wasn’t letting the company get away with it. These kinds of claims helped to shape perceptions of the drug among patients, doctors, and journalists. At an open F.D.A. hearing in May, 2012, busloads of A.H.F. employees showed up to make statements against PrEP, raising questions about the drug’s side effects, its price tag, its potential to incite risky behavior, its failure to prevent other S.T.D.s, and the possibility that imperfect adherence to the pill’s daily regimen would lead to the spread of a Truvada-resistant strain of H.I.V. Though data from the studies largely contradicts these criticisms, they were widely circulated. “I think the advocacy that A.H.F. did was very effective,” Weinstein told me. “We were quoted in virtually every article that was written.” Gilead’s efforts to promote Truvada for PrEP treatments have been somewhat meagre. “In any other kind of F.D.A. approval, there would have been beautiful ads, lots of TV, and lots of press touting the fact that this was the new thing to keep people protected from H.I.V.,” said Ernest Hopkins, the director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco aids Foundation. “Gilead chose not to do that.” According to Jim Rooney, Gilead’s vice-president of medical affairs, the company “spends several million dollars” on educational initiatives related to PrEP, delivered through third-party groups, but it “does not view PrEP as a commercial opportunity.” Truvada is already a blockbuster drug for Gilead; it earned the company more than three billion dollars in global sales in 2012. As Rooney notes, “The role of antiretrovirals in H.I.V. prevention is not yet defined and not yet broadly accepted.” Although Gilead has donated drugs to researchers working on PrEP, it has not undertaken its own study. According to Jim Pickett, the director of prevention advocacy at the aids Foundation of Chicago, “Pharmaceutical companies had to be dragged into new prevention research. They weren’t excited about it. They didn’t want to do it.” PrEP’s main problem is that many public-health officials believe people will see it as a substitute for condoms. Out magazine provoked a backlash when it printed a positive report on PrEP in early September, called “Is This the New Condom?” Commenters berated the author, Tim Murphy, and accused the magazine of irresponsibly promoting an unproven medicine at the expense of condoms. Unfortunately, as Grant points out, when it comes to preventing H.I.V. the perceived efficacy of condoms “exceeds their public-health value.” According to the C.D.C.’s Smith, condoms provide a high degree of protection when they’re used consistently, but data shows that very few people use them consistently enough to derive a substantial benefit, and self-reported condom use falls precipitously when people are asked repeatedly if they’re using condoms over an extended period of time. In the data analyzed by the C.D.C., the difference in protection levels for those who sometimes use condoms and those who never use them was not statistically significant. The corresponding figures for PrEP are much better: while adherence is a concern, as it is with condoms, Truvada offers H.I.V. protection that is more effective than any other method short of abstinence. In the N.I.H. study, for example, 5.2 per cent of the placebo group “seroconverted,” or became H.I.V. positive, compared with 2.9 per cent of the Truvada group. That’s a forty-four-per-cent added protection over-all—better than inconsistent condom use. More impressively, patients who maintained a detectable amount of the drug in their system were protected at a rate of ninety-five per cent. (A later statistical analysis estimated that the drug would need to be taken four times a week to offer protection in that range.) Grant said that people in the study who took the drug four to seven days a week “were absolutely protected. We didn’t have anyone seroconvert in our cohort in the United States.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold Taking Truvada to prevent H.I.V. comes with very few risks. In the N.I.H. study, one in two hundred people had to temporarily go off the pill owing to kidney issues, but even those people were able to resume treatment after a couple of weeks. While bone-density loss occasionally occurs in Truvada takers who are already infected with the virus, no significant bone issues have emerged in the PrEP studies. And though about one in ten PrEP takers suffer from nausea at the onset of treatment, it usually dissipates after a couple of weeks. According to the U.N. panel’s Karim, Truvada’s side-effects profile is “terrific,” and Grant said that common daily medications like aspirin and birth control, as well as drugs to control blood pressure and cholesterol, are all arguably more toxic than Truvada. Perhaps more important, drug resistance has not been observed in people who were H.I.V.-negative when they began treatment. “We’re not seeing people getting infected who are actually taking the drug,” said Grant. “There are people who take the drug home with them and choose not to take it; they get infected, but you’re not going to get drug resistance from something that stays in a drawer.” Some patients who entered the trials turned out to already have an H.I.V. infection that was too recent to be caught by a blood test. These subjects showed a small amount of drug resistance, which is why the F.D.A. now requires doctors to conduct an H.I.V. test before putting their patients on PrEP. The larger resistance threat, though, comes from the ten million H.I.V.-positive people around the world who take antiretrovirals for treatment, including, in some cases, Truvada. “The best way to prevent drug resistance is to prevent H.I.V. infection entirely,” said Grant. “We know that when we prevent a case of H.I.V., we’re preventing a lifelong risk of drug resistance.” Whether using PrEP will cause patients to abandon condoms and increase their number of sexual partners isn’t known. Grant insists that the evidence does not support such a conclusion: “Everyone said that if we offer pre-exposure prophylaxis to people, even in a randomized trial, like we did, it’s just going to cause them to have more sexual partners and stop using condoms. We found the opposite: that people had fewer sexual partners and used condoms more.” Then again, participants in the major PrEP studies received free condoms and regular sexual-health counselling. They also may not have been telling the truth about their sexual practices. Ken Mayer, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of H.I.V. Prevention Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, believes that some migration away from condoms and toward Truvada is inevitable, but that it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad trade-off, given PrEP’s efficacy and the fact that many of the people likely to go on the treatment don’t use condoms anyway. This squares with my own conversations with people on PrEP: most of them are seeking PrEP not because they wish to abandon condoms but because they already don’t use them. The C.D.C.’s usage guidelines stress that PrEP is something to be taken in addition to using condoms, since PrEP doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted diseases. Cost, at least in the United States, has also turned out to be a smaller concern than initially predicted. Smith said, “We were very surprised to find out the insurance companies said, ‘Yes, we’ll pay for it. It’s much more expensive to treat people who have H.I.V. infections.’ ” While a lot of people at high risk for contracting H.I.V. currently lack health insurance, after January 1st many of them will be able to get coverage through Obamacare. And for those who still don’t have insurance or who have unmanageable co-pays, Gilead provides assistance to purchase the drug, which has a sticker price of thirteen thousand dollars a year. In the developing world, however, where even delivering cheap generic versions of Truvada can be a challenge, it remains unclear whether diverting resources to prevention on a wide scale makes sense. Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, points out, however, that the same argument was once made against using antiretrovirals for treatment. “Ten years ago, people said you couldn’t provide treatment in Africa: people wouldn’t adhere, it was too expensive, it would create resistance,” he said. “Many of those issues have been addressed—they haven’t all been overcome—and now we have ten million people on treatment.” Making PrEP available, particularly to protect young women in sub-Saharan Africa, said Karim, “is essential to achieving an aids-free generation.” Because H.I.V.-positive people who go on antiretrovirals have a drastically reduced risk of transmission, aids is spreading more slowly than it used to. Weinstein, of the A.H.F., was among the first to attempt to bring antiretrovirals to Africa. He pointed out that there are ten million people around the world on antiretrovirals today, mostly thanks to George W. Bush’s global aids initiative. “If we can double that to twenty million,” he said, “I think we will have brought H.I.V. under control.” Truvada for prevention, one might conclude, is an expansion of that concept. One of the problems is that PrEP lacks a built-in constituency to advocate for it. “act up is focussed on people already living with aids,” said Mayer. And while the opponents of PrEP have been loud and persistent, its supporters tend to be stately and circumspect. Many of the arguments made against Truvada, they note, are the same arguments that proponents of abstinence lodged against birth control in the sixties and against condoms in the eighties. “It takes a long time when it’s a medical intervention that has to do with sexual practices,” said Grant. Gilead predicts that it will take five to ten years for PrEP to become widely used in the U.S., by which time Truvada could be off-patent. When I corresponded again with Pickett, of the aids Foundation of Chicago, after the publication of the Out article and the ensuing backlash, he appeared to disavow some of his enthusiasm regarding PrEP. What opponents needed to understand, he said, was that “no one was really envisioning widespread use of Truvada as PrEP. It really is a niche intervention—which should be targeted and used very strategically. No one wants to hand this out to everyone in a key population.” When pressed, he clarified that he thought Truvada was for anyone in a high-risk group who struggled with monogamy or consistent use of condoms, a delineation that would seem to include millions of people in the United States alone. While skepticism about PrEP will undoubtedly recede over time, for the moment it remains strong. I was recently speaking with a twenty-six-year-old urban planner living in Brooklyn, who overheard me talking about PrEP. “Oh yeah,” he said, with a worried look. “I’ve heard of that. I saw that piece in Out. It said it doesn’t work, right?” Photograph by Jb Reed/Bloomberg/Getty By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Vanishing I.R.S. Scandal,6070,"With Edward Snowden on the lam, the Supreme Court doing its bit to undermine the Great Society, and Don Draper getting his comeuppance, it’s hard to remember last week, let alone last month. But let’s go back to early May, when another great scandal threatened the fabric of the republic. George Will compared it to Watergate. James Taranto, a columnist at the Wall Street Journal, suggested that it might be worse than a cancer on the Presidency. I’m referring, of course, to the shocking revelation, contained in an investigative report from the Treasury Department’s Inspector General for Tax Administration, that some lowly I.R.S. officials in a Cincinnati office that deals with applications for tax-free status from philanthropic organizations used words like “Tea Party” and “Patriots” to screen forms for further review. Republican senators and congressmen accused the Obama Administration of using the I.R.S. to intimidate its opponents. Rush Limbaugh spied a White House coverup. The acting head of the I.R.S., Steven Miller, lost his job. Even Jon Stewart flipped his lid. Fast forward a month and a half and Darrell Issa, the intrepid California Republican who heads the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (and who was the subject of a 2011 article in the magazine by Ryan Lizza), is still bravely trying to get to the bottom of it all—subpoenaing documents, carrying out interviews, and scheduling hearings. Having earned sixty million dollars in 2012 from his extensive investments, the fifty-nine-year-old Issa could easily be relaxing on the beach in Oceanside or Hawaii: instead, he’s devoting his time and energy to enlightening the public about what was really going on inside the I.R.S. His investigation has turned out to be invaluable, although not necessarily in the way he had planned. Earlier this month, Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Committee, released portions of an interview with one of the I.R.S. officials in Cincinnati who instigated the effort to give extra scrutiny to Tea Party groups and other organizations affiliated with the right. It turned out that this man, who is reportedly John Shafer, a conservative Republican, launched the screening program after an underling noticed a surge in applications from organizations that appeared to be affiliated with the Tea Party. “I do not believe that the screening of these cases had anything to do, other than consistency and identifying issues that needed to have further development,” Shafer said, according to the transcript released by Cummings. Asked if he believed the White House was involved, Shafer replied, “I have no reason to believe that.” Now comes another revelation relevant to Issa’s investigation: I.R.S. employees in Cincinnati also targeted applications from liberal groups for further scrutiny, and they did it for the same reason they singled out conservative groups: a fear that such organizations might turn out to be primarily political rather than philanthropic. (Many political organizations are not eligible for tax-exempt status.) Specifically, the “Be On the Lookout” memos that I.R.S. managers sent to workers in the tax-exempt division instructed them to look carefully at groups with the word “progressive” in their names. “Common thread is the word ‘progressive,’ ” the memo said. “Activities appear to lean toward a new political party. Activities are partisan and appear as anti-Republican.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" The release of the internal I.R.S. documents came as the agency’s new acting head, Danny Werfel, confirmed in a conference call with reporters that the agency’s screening of groups suspected as being political was broader than previously thought, and crossed the political spectrum. In addition to “Tea Party” and “progressive,” the I.R.S. investigators screened for another dozen or so terms. According to lists released by Democrats in Congress, these included “Medical Marijuana,” “Occupied Territory Advocacy,” “Green Energy Organizations,” and “Healthcare legislation.” Back in May, when Miller was being hauled up to Capitol Hill and berated by our elected representatives, I suggested, and others did, too, that the I.R.S. brouhaha was a “non-scandal,” a case for Inspector Clouseau rather than Eliot Ness. With every passing day, it seems like this judgment was sound—not that it was particularly clever or original. To get the real story, all you had to do was read what the I.R.S. told the Inspector General and listen to what people like Miller were saying. Over to the Columbia Journalism Review’s Ryan Chittum, who has been following this ludicrous saga more closely than I have: Rather than the Nixonian conspiracy… you have a routine bureaucratic procedure meant to bundle potentially problematic applicants together for further review. The “abuses” the right has screamed about are the same ones that nonprofit journalism applicants like SF Public Press, The Lens, and many others faced, especially long delays and invasive questioning (and, ultimately, approval—no Tea Party group’s application ultimately was denied). Again, this was not some big secret. It was readily available information. But don’t let any of this stop you, Congressman Issa (and your cheerleaders in the conservative media). If you keep on digging, you might end up being even more discredited than you are already. Photograph by Drew Angerer/The New York Times/Redux.

Obamacare: The Great Experiment Begins,15138,"More than three years after President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, some of the big changes in the nation’s health-delivery system that the legislation mandated are about to go into effect. With the pro and anti forces already claiming victory, there’s a lot of misinformation going around about how the new system will operate. Critics who claimed that the reform, which ran to nearly two thousand pages, was too complicated even to get off the ground have been discredited. But big questions remain about how things will shake out. The good news is that, in large parts of the country, there’s been substantial progress toward getting the system up and running. Last week, California, the most populous state in the country, rolled out details of its online health-insurance exchange, through which people and families without group coverage will be able to purchase individual plans. Starting on October 1st, people will start enrolling in new plans through the exchanges, and come next January, all Americans (with a few exceptions) will be legally obliged to acquire some sort of health coverage or face a fine. Some low-income people who aren’t currently eligible will be able to enroll in Medicaid, the federal system for the poor and indigent. Other low-to-middle-income families will be able to obtain federal subsidies covering up to ninety per cent of their monthly insurance payments. Health insurers will be prohibited from denying coverage to individuals, or charging them higher rates, based on gender or preëxisting conditions. The reform was designed to do two things that might seem, at first glance, contradictory: expand coverage to the estimated forty-five million Americans who are uninsured and hold down costs for everybody else, taxpayers included. When the bill passed, I expressed some skepticism about whether this would prove possible, but that was just speculation. Now, or pretty soon, we will have some actual evidence about how the system will work. Several things bear watching: 1. How many insurance companies will offer coverage through the new exchanges? Under the current system, two or three companies dominate the individual insurance market in many parts of the country, and competition is squelched. The theory behind Obamacare is that, with a system of exchanges, vigorous competition among numerous providers will drive improvements in the quality of health care and hold down costs. On this score, the initial outlook is encouraging. In California, nearly three dozen insurance companies submitted bids to offer coverage on the state’s new exchange. Thirteen were selected, including some of the biggest participants in the current system, such as Kaiser Permanente, Health Net, and Blue Shield of California. Notably absent were several big national insurance companies—UnitedHealth, Aetna, and Cigna—but the fact that so many firms did choose to get involved was a plus. The Obama Administration insists California is likely to prove the rule rather than the exception. According to an analysis that the White House put out on Thursday, “About 90% of target enrollees will have five or more difference [sic] insurance company choices.” The figure is based on data from nineteen states, which are home to about eighty per cent of the folks who are likely to use the exchanges. 2. How many of the uninsured will use the new exchanges? Insurance works by pooling risks. If more healthy young people enroll, it will help bring down everybody else’s costs. But if plans turn out to be prohibitively expensive, many young people may initially choose to skip coverage and pay the fine, which starts out pretty low—ninety-five dollars for a single adult—and increases sharply in subsequent years to six hundred and ninety-five dollars in 2016. (The Kaiser Family Foundation has posted a helpful primer on the individual mandate. For those who want to know even more about how it will operate, the I.R.S., which will be in charge of tracking enrollment and collecting fines, has published an extensive Q. & A.) Some preliminary cost figures from Covered California, the organization that will operate the state’s insurance exchange, illustrate the issue. The premiums will vary by age and geographic location, and also by the benefits and level of co-payments included in the plans, which come in four types: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Let’s take a forty-year-old single person with no dependents. For a typical Silver plan sold through the exchange, his or her monthly premium will be about two hundred and ninety-four dollars a month. According to the Los Angeles Times, the average premium last year for individual plans sold on eHealthInsurance in California was just a hundred and seventy-seven dollars. That’s an increase of about sixty-six per cent. “These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” Peter V. Lee, the executive director of Covered California said. “But let’s be clear, some consumers will have prices that go up. There may be some sticker shock.” Two important points need making here. First, it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. The higher premiums in the new plans reflect the fact that insurers will be mandated to provide more benefits than many current plans do. Second, thanks to generous federal subsidies, paid directly to insurance companies, many low-to-middle-income people will pay a lot less than the quoted price. Covered California says more than half of the people shopping on the new exchange will be eligible for subsidies. According to its estimates, a forty-year-old Angeleno who earns about twenty-three thousand dollars a year, twice the federal poverty level, would end up paying about ninety dollars a month, rather than more than three hundred dollars a month, for one of the lower-priced Silver plans. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Still, some existing purchasers of individual insurance who can’t be classified as rich, and who won’t be eligible for much if any help from the government, will end up facing sharply higher rates. Take, for example, a single forty-year-old Californian who makes forty-five thousand dollars a year, roughly four times the poverty level. He (or she) won’t be eligible for any subsidy, which means he (or she) will have to pay the entire cost, which is three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight dollars a year. It remains to be seen how this will impact enrollment rates. 3. To what extent will employers start to shed their health-insurance plans, or shift the costs of them onto their employees? The Affordable Care Act requires all businesses with fifty employees or more to provide health coverage. However, some critics argue that this provision could backfire. Given that corporate insurance plans cost up to five thousand dollars a year per person, businesses, rather than complying with the reform, could have a financial incentive to pay a fine, which amounts to about two thousand dollars per employee. Although this argument is usually made about small firms that don’t currently offer insurance coverage, it could also apply to big firms that do. As the individual exchanges get up and running, the skeptics say, many corporations will start to shed their corporate plans, leaving their workers to look after themselves. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who advised John McCain in his Presidential run, says tens of millions of Americans could lose their employer-provided plans. Other estimates are more modest, but not inconsequential. Earlier this year, the C.B.O., which initially said about three million workers would lose their coverage, raised that figure to seven million. This might happen, but then again it might not. When you look closely at the Affordable Care Act you find that, in many cases, firms will be able to shift most of the cost of the insurance plans onto their employees, leaving the company itself with just modest contributions to make. In a new article at Forbes.com, Donald Susswein, a Washington tax lawyer who used to work for the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee, lays out some arithmetic for a hypothetical firm whose employees earn forty thousand dollars a year, and which has been quoted an insurance policy costing five thousand dollars a year per person covered. Under the terms of the Act, Susswein points out, the firm can force its employees to contribute up to three thousand eight hundred dollars—9.5 per cent of their total wages—toward the cost of health insurance and still claim to have provided “affordable” coverage. That would leave the firm paying just one thousand two hundred dollars per worker, and that, unlike the penalty for non-compliance, would be fully tax deductible. “That is why,” Susswein writes, “most employers who consult their tax advisors will prefer to provide the minimum required insurance subsidies rather than paying a nondeductible $2,000 tax penalty for failure to provide affordable healthcare coverage.” That logic would suggest most businesses will continue to provide health coverage, but many employees could end up shouldering a much bigger share of its cost. And there’s more. The law obliges employers to provide coverage for their employees—but not for their spouses and children. If a firm doesn’t want to bear the costs of family members in its plan, it will be able to shift the entire cost of doing so to its employees. Thus, Susswein writes, “Even if the spouse is also making $40,000 and receives a similar $1,200 subsidy from her employer, the total family cost for premiums could be over $10,000. That is $3,800 for each spouse, plus around $4,000 to cover their children. As a result, many families may decide not to purchase insurance, or delay the purchase until someone becomes ill. This is the free-rider problem the law was supposed to fix.” Other experts are more sanguine about how the new law will work. But the mere fact that some people who would generally be considered middle class will have to pay out considerable sums, while other, less affluent, households will receive generous subsidies, raises another question. 4. Will the level of subsidies become a political issue? Given the reliance on costly private insurance plans to achieve universal coverage, it was inevitable that the system of subsidies would be pretty generous. Even now, though, I don’t think the redistributionary nature of the new system is fully appreciated. When it does become clear, it could easily spark a political backlash among households that aren’t receiving any government support. Let’s go back to California for a moment and consider two hypothetical families. Both include two parents and two children, but in one, the combined income is forty thousand dollars a year; in the other, it’s ninety-five thousand dollars. Neither has group coverage. According to the Covered California cost calculator, the estimated Silver-plan premium for a family of four in which the parents are forty years old is eight hundred and eighty dollars, or ten thousand five hundred and sixty dollars a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, the poorer family will be entitled to a subsidy of seven hundred and sixteen dollars each month (eight thousand five hundred and ninety-two dollars a year), bringing its net cost down to a hundred and sixty-four dollars a month (one thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight dollars a year). The more well-to-do family, although hardly rich, won’t be eligible for any subsidies at all, and will have to come up with the entire ten thousand five hundred and sixty dollars—more than ten per cent of its pre-tax income. From the perspective of expanding health-care access for poorer households and reducing inequality, this discrepancy is easily justified. But will it prove politically sustainable? I’m not so sure. The recent history of California, for example, is replete with examples of populist movements based on the notion that middle-class and upper-middle-class taxpayers are already bearing too much of a burden. If these same people start to think they are bearing the cost of Obamacare, there could be pressure to reduce the subsidies, or to further expand Medicaid, which is a cheaper option for insuring low-income and low-to-middle-income earners. 5. Will the recent slowdown in over-all health-care spending be sustained? One of the best pieces of news we’ve had over the past few years is a slowdown in health-care cost inflation. According to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, between 2009 and 2011 spending on health rose at an annual rate of just 3.9 per cent, the lowest rate since the government started calculating this figure in 1960. That’s pretty remarkable, even if, as Wonkblog’s Ezra Klein pointed out on Friday, there’s precious little agreement about what caused the slowdown. Some experts point to the Great Recession, which, they say, forced Americans to economize on health-care spending as well as everything else. Other commentators give some credit to the Affordable Care Act, which included a number of changes in Medicare and Medicaid designed to encourage doctors and hospitals to be more efficient. And some observers point to developments within the existing system of employer-provided insurance, such as the shifting of costs onto employees through higher deductibles and co-payments, which encourage people to “consume” fewer health services. As the economic recovery continues and Obamacare kicks in, it will be fascinating to see what happens to the cost curve. Within the Affordable Care Act, there are several provisions designed to restrict spending growth, such as penalizing with higher taxes companies that offer so-called “Cadillac plans,” establishing an independent advisory board to recommend ways of restraining Medicare outlays, and, of course, promoting competition on the insurance exchanges. On the other side of the ledger, the expansion of coverage to millions of previously uncovered Americans will tend to increase the level of over-all health-care spending, as will the expansion of benefits in government-approved plans. There have been false dawns before, like the one that happened during the nineteen-nineties, when the rise of H.M.O.s led to a temporary dip in spending growth. Will this slowdown prove more durable? The answer to this, and other questions, we are about to find out. Photograph by Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Inaugurating Pope Francis,9163,"While the new Pope, Francis, has made a point of emphasizing simplicity—rather than wearing the usual gold ring, he has insisted on one made of silver—today he gave way to Vatican tradition and formally assumed his office following most (but not all) of the elaborate ceremonial script worked out in minute detail over more than a thousand years. Even within this deeply traditional institution, the script has changed, sometimes quite substantially. Popes are now “inaugurated” and not crowned; Pope Paul VI, in 1963, was the first who declined to wear a crown, although he was still carried about in a special papal litter (la sedia gestatoria), a kind of portable throne—a practice that his successor, the short-lived John Paul I, abandoned in 1978. And Francis obediently read from the heavy Latin tomes held up in front of him by the papal retinue, after being led outside St. Peter’s Basilica by hundreds of men in golden robes and tall white hats who chanted solemnly in Latin and flowed like a gold ribbon through the aisles of the church. On the loggia of the basilica, they faced hundreds of thousands of faithful who had gathered in the arms of the enormous colonnade in St. Peter’s Square. Tradition is so central to the Catholic Church that Cardinal Timothy Dolan recently remarked that it should be always be spelled with a capital “T”: Tradition. As a result, the fifty-six hundred accredited journalists in Rome, as well as millions of Catholics around the world, have spent much of the past five days since Pope Francis’s election parsing the large and small ways in which he has varied the usual routine. Much was made of his first words when he appeared at the window of St. Peter’s—“Buona sera” (“Good evening”), a simple human greeting rather than a specifically papal or religious expression, as well as of the last words that closed his Sunday homily: “Buon pranzo” (“Have a good lunch”). There has, however, been little question that Pope Francis, the former Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, has been trying to send a series of messages since his selection: his decision to wear a plain white priest’s cassock instead of cardinal or papal robes, his request that the Argentine clergy not come to his inauguration and instead donate the travel funds to the poor. Some of the messages have been more explicit. In speaking to the press two days after his election, he said that he wanted “a church that is poor and for the poor.” He has reportedly annoyed parts of the traditional Vatican bureaucracy by pointedly ignoring the prepared remarks drawn up by his would-be handlers and speaking off the cuff, with great simplicity and even a sense of humor. He even appeared to violate the rule against discussing the internal workings of the papal conclave when he spoke to the journalists: I will tell you the story. During the election, I was seated next to the Archbishop Emeritus of São Paolo and Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Clergy, Cardinal Cláudio Hummes—a good friend, a good friend! When things were looking dangerous, he encouraged me. And when the votes reached two-thirds, there was the usual applause, because the Pope had been elected. And he gave me a hug and a kiss, and said, “Don’t forget the poor!” And those words came to me: the poor, the poor. Then, right away, thinking of the poor, I thought of Francis of Assisi. Then, joking, he said that some of his fellow cardinals suggested he should take the name of Clement XV in order to “pay back Clement XIV, who suppressed the Jesuit order.” The inauguration, though it kept closer to the script, was not without similar touches. Francis made a couple of trips around the piazza in the so-called Popemobile, a kind of customized white jeep or golf cart the Popes have used in the past thirty-five years to circulate around the large piazza. After the assassination attempt on John Paul II, a heavy bulletproof plexiglass sheet was added to the front of the vehicle for better security. Francis dispensed with the shield and even stepped down from the Popemobile to embrace a severely disabled man in the crowd. The messages of his first two homilies—the one he pronounced at the Sunday Angelus service and the one at today’s inauguration ceremony—were short, simple, and highly inclusive. He recounted the story of the adultress from the New Testament on Sunday: “He who is without sin, let him cast the first stone.” He quoted an old woman who had told him that without mercy the world would not exist. “I asked her if she had taught theology at the Gregorian University,” he said, joking about the Jesuit university in Rome. As I left St. Peter’s Square today, I ran into a group of Franciscan friars from Southern Italy. They were very satisfied with the proceedings. “Very Franciscan,” one of them said. “Simple, sober, clear. The homily was only about seven and a half minutes and contained a strong but simple message of love and faith.” “That’s what we need,” a second friar chimed in, “because many people are losing faith, also because of the disgusting sins of the Church itself.” The homily was dedicated to the rather humble figure of St. Joseph, the carpenter husband of the Virgin Mary who, faced with the almost incomprehensible miracle of Mary’s immaculate conception, takes mother and child away to safety: Joseph is the custodian, he protects Mary and Jesus…. We must remember that service is power. He does so not out of weakness but out of strength. We must remember that service is power. We must be custodians, caring for others, caring for the Church but also for those outside the Church, stewards of the environment and all of creation. Residents in the St. Peter’s area noted that both the number of spectators and the enthusiasm for the new pope have been higher this year than in 2005, when Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Leonard Cohen on Preparing for Death The apparent gamble of Francis’s papacy is to bring about a change in the Church’s attitude and behavior without (in all likelihood) a substantial change in doctrine. Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer, the secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, made it clear that although many things in the Catholic world are subject to change—“Twenty or thirty years, you would have never seen women teaching theology in a Catholic university, now there are many”—doctrine is not one of them: “There cannot be women priests, that’s impossible. It’s established doctrine.” Similarly, in the Sunday sermon at Rome’s Pontifical North American College, following Francis’s inauguration, Cardinal Francis George, the Archbishop of Chicago, adopted a somewhat combative tone toward America’s “post-Freudian culture,” which insists on seeing “celibacy as a threat.” He also criticized the press and secular society, which “judge the Church as good as long as it does social services and bad to the extent that it makes truth claims.” With a much gentler tone, Pope Francis, in his remarks to the press, alluded to the difficulty the secular world has in understanding the imperatives of the Church. “The Church,” he said, “is certainly a human and historical institution with all that that entails, yet her nature is not essentially political but spiritual: the Church is the people of God, the holy people of God making its way to encounter Jesus Christ. Only from this perspective can a satisfactory account be given of the Church’s life and activity.” Many were struck by the skill and delicacy with which he alluded to the fact that many in the press were not his natural constituents: “Since many of you are not members of the Catholic Church, and others are not believers, I cordially give this blessing silently, to each of you, respecting the conscience of each, but in the knowledge that each of you is a child of God. May God bless you!” But this should not be mistaken for a retreat on matters of traditional doctrine. The initial impression is that what Francis and others in the Church have in mind is a Church that is more pastoral, more attentive to the needs of the poor than its traditional prerogatives, and more forthcoming with the outside world, but no less firm about issues—whether gay marriage, sexual morality, or the contraception provisions in Obama’s healthcare reforms—that have divided many Catholics. Pope Francis is clearly enjoying a honeymoon period; the conflicts are yet to come, and we will see whether the Church’s new tone will change the nature of the debate.

What Beppe Grillo Wants,6179,"After last week’s general elections in Italy, Peer Steinbrück, the Social Democrat who is running for Chancellor of Germany, said he was “shocked” that Italy had elected “two clowns.” One of the funnymen Steinbrück had in mind was Silvio Berlusconi, though Il Berlusca seems less like a clown than a B-movie zombie: no matter how many times a magistrate blasts him with charges of bribery, extortion, tax fraud, or sex with an underage prostitute, he keeps rising from the dead and running, running, running for Prime Minister. Steinbrück’s second clown was Beppe Grillo, a charismatic comedian and social critic—Italy’s answer to Stephen Colbert—whose three-year-old political movement had just won a quarter of the Italian popular vote to become the leading party in the lower house of parliament. The Economist made the same joke on its cover, with photographs of Grillo and Berlusconi, and the headline “Send in the Clowns.” Grillo certainly doesn’t sound like a politician. “I was just down in Rome with our new parliamentarians—young, spotless, upstanding people,” he told me yesterday. “And we announced, ‘Ok, so now we’re going to get down to work, and keep all the promises we made during the election campaign.’ People stared at us wide-eyed and said, ‘Keep your election promises? How dare you?’ ” He sighed happily. “It’s marvellous what we’ve managed to do, with no money, in three short years. We’re bringing strong ideas back into government, words that we had inside ourselves but were afraid to say—solidarity, community, feeling a part of something.” It’s hard to get the straight story about Grillo anywhere. The Italian press, both liberal and conservative, is unrelentingly hostile. Grillo’s pledge to end the widespread political control and funding of the Italian media may help to explain this. Likewise, the political old guard in Italy denounces Grillo as—take your pick—a right-wing demagogue; a left-wing anarchist/saboteur/naysayer without constructive plans for Italy; a narcissist in the thrall of a personality cult; or the puppet of some menacing, but as yet unidentified, puppet master. This belligerence may have something to do with Grillo’s promises to “send home” the entire ruling class, Europe’s most entrenched and self-serving, which he blames for Italy’s badly frayed economic and social fabric. It’s also true that some Italians simply don’t know what to make of him (and others have listened seriously to him and just don’t agree). Some time ago, I spent a week with Grillo while reporting a Profile for The New Yorker—snooping around his home near Genoa, talking with him backstage after shows and rallies, travelling with him in Lombardy and Sardinia. What I saw makes me think that Peer Steinbrück and other politicians, abroad and in Italy, along with much of the press, has him wrong. True, Grillo is a funny fellow, but in person he’s also pensive, inquisitive, and a tad professorial; his library is filled with underlined, dog-eared tomes on economics, renewable energy, and healthcare, and he frequently sounds out ideas with their authors, members of a Nobel-studded brain trust that includes Joseph Stiglitz, Muhammad Yunus, Lester Brown, and Dario Fo. Grillo ignores other politicians and the press, and broadcasts his messages through alternative channels: comedy shows, city-council meetings, demonstrations, and MeetUp gatherings across Italy, and via his Web site, which is run by the Internet guru Gianroberto Casaleggio but displays Grillo’s blend of irreverence, optimism, and fruitful obscenity. (Much of it plays with words in a way that doesn’t come across easily in translation.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Grillo told me yesterday that his Movimento 5 Stelle (“Five-Star Movement,” frequently abbreviated as M5S) isn’t a political party at all but “a democratic dialogue born online and in the piazze. Every ten days, we vote on positions, always working from below, never from above—the opposite of the political pyramid that has suffocated our democracy.” In contrast to members of the political class, M5S parliamentarians must have no criminal record, will serve a maximum of two terms of office, and will take home only about a third of their salary. (The balance will be returned to the government, or used to fund social programs like microcredits.) If wanting to demolish and rebuild Italy’s dysfunctional political system makes you a radical, then Grillo certainly qualifies, though his radicalism is methodical: the M5S program, with its action steps for the economy, public health, education, energy, and other cruxes of public life, is online, and much of its content will be familiar to anyone who has listened to Grillo’s comedy routines for the last few years. Had Occupy Wall Street produced a leader with long-term vision, and a manifesto of concrete goals, it might have resembled the Movimento 5 Stelle. For all the novelty and Web jargon of Grillo’s message, too, it has a homespun quality, stressing old-school virtues like trasparenza (“transparency”), coerenza (“consistency”), efficienza (“efficiency”), and above all, democrazia (“democracy”). “Italian citizens need to participate directly in running their country, as they once did,” Grillo told me. “Voters have to enter the fray, take a personal role in political life. They have to inform themselves directly about issues, and not just swallow what they hear in the mainstream news. I want to tell Italians, ‘You cannot delegate anymore—this movement is you.’ ” Photograph by Stefano De Luigi. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"Weekend Reading: The Royal Family, Domestic Violence, and Burning Man",4363,"I was halfway through Hilary Mantel’s London Review of Books essay about the royal family when I emailed it to several friends under the subject line “Is Hilary Mantel the best writer in the world?” I haven’t read her novels, and I know I’m late with my gushing reaction, but this piece is smart and elegant, crammed with million-dollar sentences and unforgettable images, including a story about the time Mantel visited Buckingham Palace, ogled the queen “as a cannibal views his dinner,” then hid behind a sofa to get away from the party. Mantel weaves through the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy, her official portrait, the travails of her dead mother-in-law, and the indiscretions of her brother-in-law, and wraps them all up in the discovery of Richard III’s skeleton and the way history has treated Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and Marie Antoinette. It’s expansive, timely, and a total joy to read. Kathryn Miles writes about another anachronistic transplant in her piece for Outside magazine about a replica of the H.M.S. Bounty, created for the 1960 Marlon Brando movie, which sank when its crew steered it into Hurricane Sandy. If you’ve ever thought it would be romantic to purchase an eighteenth-century merchant vessel, read this piece first to make sure you have an accurate idea of just how much time you’ll be spending fixing leaks and pumping bilge. Similarly, before you become a movie star, read Anne Helen Petersen’s piece in the Virginia Quarterly Review on the history of the Hollywood publicity industry from silent movies to present. It’s a smart take on gossip culture, the nature of celebrity, and what it really takes to be a star—more showboating, leak fixing, and bilge pumping. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? While the Oscar Pistorius shooting dominates the latest round in the cultural battle over guns, Natasha Vargas-Cooper, at Buzzfeed, writes about domestic violence turned on its head. Her piece is about Joseph Hall, a young boy who was sentenced this week for shooting his abusive Neo-Nazi father when he was ten years old. It’s a grim, morally complicated story. It asks the question of when the psychological impact of brutality overshadows individual responsibility. At the Center of Investigative Reporting, Phil Bronstein has a thoroughly reported piece on the Navy seal who likely fired the shot that killed Osama Bin Laden. This is the first time that the seal, who has now left the Navy, has gone public, and he does so anonymously to avoid putting “a huge ‘kill me’ target on his back.” He adds some details to the account of the Abbottabad raid, but the key twist in his story is the trouble he has had transitioning to civilian life, where his problems with securing employment and healthcare are compounded by his concerns for the safety of his family. The extreme demands placed on the Special Forces give rise to a subculture of extremes. Bronstein gives a window into that world and challenges the way our society treats its heroes after their day of heroism. On a lighter note, one of the more entertaining reads of the week was Wells Tower’s account of his visit to the Burning Man festival with his sixty-nine-year-old father. The person-who-doesn’t-belong-at-Burning-Man-goes-to-Burning-Man genre is a little bit tired, but Tower’s story is by turns hilarious, moving, and cringe-inducing—much, one assumes, like Burning Man itself. One of the search tags GQ has assigned to the piece is “How To,” which is curious. How to what? How to survive in the desert without really trying? How to see ten years’ worth of breasts and genitalia in one week? How to feel alienated and oppressed by the crushing inevitability of old age and mortality? Because that’s what I learned.

Colorado in The New Yorker,9914,"From now until Election Day, the Back Issues blog will be looking at this year’s swing states through the lens of the New Yorker archive. There’s a lot crammed into the state of Colorado: dinosaur bones, old cowboy towns, abandoned silver mines, Focus on the Family, and the Boulder International Film Festival are all located there, smooshed together like so many sedimentary layers. As Ryan Lizza put it in a 2008 article, the state is part of the “conservative but idiosyncratic West.” In many places, especially on the coasts, political life has acquired an ossified predictability; in Colorado, political, social, and economic developments have happened in surprising and new combinations. One of the most striking things about Colorado is that, over the past few decades, it’s become a home-base for both Democrats and Republicans—a place to which both parties look for a glimpse of their possible futures. In “The Code of the West”—probably the most illuminating piece in The New Yorker for readers interested in present-day Colorado politics—Lizza explains what’s made this possible. In the seventies, Lizza writes, “the state’s politics were partially defined by ardent environmentalists and the slow-growth movement”; later, in the nineties, the pendulum swung the other way, and Colorado became an important center for the religious right, and for the anti-tax movement that blossomed, eventually, into the Tea Party. Politics in Colorado is unusually dynamic, Lizza writes, because, unlike on the East Coast, “there’s no culture of political patronage.... [I]ndividual candidates and personalities matter far more than party labels. Colorado’s voter registration is divided roughly into equal thirds: Republicans, Democrats, and independents, with independents growing the fastest.” In the early 2000s, when many of Colorado’s moderates became disillusioned with the Republicans, who were fixated on social issues like gay marriage, the pendulum swung back the other way. In 2008, Lizza reported, the Democratic Party believes that Colorado presents an opportunity to embrace a new, Western form of liberalism, one which will make the party “less and less like the party of F.D.R., Truman, and Lyndon Johnson,” and engaged instead with entrepreneurs and small businesses, environmental issues, and the concerns of educated voters—“more oriented towards high-tech workers and less toward labor,” as one analyst explains it. Much of The New Yorker’s Colorado coverage has revolved around the technology industry, which is central to the state’s economy to a degree many people find surprising. Much of that technology has its origins in the military. In “No Place to Hide,” from 2000, Michael Specter visits with the government researchers based in Colorado Springs who developed the G.P.S. system; in “The Button,” from 1985, Daniel Ford takes a trip inside the Cheyenne Mountain complex where norad is located. (It’s also where the movie “War Games” and the long-running sci-fi TV show “Stargate: SG-1” were set.) The atomic clock, from which all other clocks in the United States derive their time, is located in Colorado, where scientists associated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology are working on its even-more-accurate successor; in 1973, E. J. Khan wrote about the clock, in “The Leap Second.” All that technology has left its mark on Colorado in surprising, and even moving, ways. In “The Uranium Widows,” Peter Hessler travels to the uranium-mining town of Uravan, where much of the uranium ore used by the Manhattan Project was milled—or, rather, to the place where the town used to be, since, in the years after the Second World War, the site was found to be radioactive and deemed unfit for human habitation. Its roads were dug up, its trees pulped, and its buildings shredded. “On the other side of the world,” Hessler writes, “Hiroshima and Nagasaki are revived cities, but the town that helped make the bomb has been wiped completely off the face of the earth.” Many of the residents of Uravan have relocated to nearby towns, like Paradox, Colorado. (“Around here, place names have the ring of parables: Calamity Mesa, Disappointment Creek, Starvation Point.”) When representatives of the uranium-mining industry, which left Colorado in 1979, talk about starting up the mines again, those residents, and their descendents, turn out to be enthusiastic supporters of the idea. Despite the fact that many miners died of lung cancer, they maintain that there’s nothing inherently dangerous about uranium minining. (It was smoking in unventilated mines, they say, that was so unhealthy.) Hessler is initially incredulous, but, over time, he starts to find their arguments convincing. The locals maintain, for example, that a worker in Grand Central Terminal is exposed to higher levels of radiation than a worker in a uranium mill, and this turns out to be essentially true: “The walls of Grand Central Terminal,” Hessler discovers, “are made of granite, which contains elements that produce radon; a worker there receives a larger dose of radiation than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows a uranium mill to emit to a next-door neighbor.” The miners and their families, he writes, are intelligent, careful, and brave—not innocent and ignorant, as many outsiders assume. “I understand uranium,” one woman says, “and I’m not afraid of it.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Fearlessness, unsurprisingly, is a common theme in The New Yorker’s writing about Colorado. In “Roughing It,” Dorothy Wickenden tells the story of her grandmother, also named Dorothy, who, in 1916, aged twenty-nine, travelled to the remote frontier town of Elkhead, Colorado to become a schoolteacher. Dorothy, along with her best friend Rosamond, had been recruited by a cattle rancher named Farrington Carpenter, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School who had moved out to Colorado and founded the school. “Although Carpenter did intend to create a great school,” Wickenden writes, “his plan was also something of a ruse”: Tall and rangy, with large ears, a long face, and a prominent nose, he, too, was twenty -- nine years old.... [H]is friends had chosen him to solve their biggest problem: the absence of eligible women in the vicinity. A freewheeling storyteller, he told a writer who was profiling him in the Saturday Evening Post, in 1952: “We did not want strays. We had serious matrimonial intentions, and we decided that young, pretty schoolteachers would be the best bet of all.” Dorothy and Rosamond, who had both graduated from Smith College and had been identified by an acquaintence of Carpenter’s as “the prettiest and liveliest girls in their class,” were ideal candidates, and, it turned out, excellent schoolteachers. Their schoolhouse was a solitary, newly-built stone building on the top of a hill, from which you could see the surrounding territory laid out, Dorothy wrote, like “a topographical map”: “roll after roll of rounded bare hills with little water creases markng them—and no sign of human being or habitation.” They had around two dozen students, many of whom skied to school in the winter, on barrel-staves. I won’t ruin the ending for you by telling you who marries whom, though I will say that bandits are involved. If you want to know what happens, you can read the whole story here. One of the magazine’s most beloved Colorado stories was published only last year: “Dr. Don,” which is also by Peter Hessler. It’s a profile of Don Colcord, a druggist who lives in Nucla, Colorado, and runs a small pharmacy called the Apothecary Shoppe. Dr. Don, as his customers calls him, embodies the strange mixture of qualities and experiences that the magazine has found, again and again, in Colorado. Nucla, Hessler writes, is in the southwestern corner of Colorado, in “a region of more than four thousand square miles which has no hospitals, no department stores, and only one pharmacy”—Don’s. Don doesn’t have a medical degree, but he’s effectively responsible for the healthcare of everyone he knows. He has “some qualities,” Hessler writes, “that may seem contradictory”: Don sells cigarettes at his pharmacy, because he believes that people have the right to do unhealthy things. He votes Democratic, a rarity in this region. He listens to Bocelli and drives a Lexus. At Easter, the Colcord family tradition is to dye eggs, line them up in a pasture, and fire away with a 25 -- 06 Remington.... He has taken CPR courses, and he’s qualified to use an electric defibrillator. He has a pyrotechnics-display license, so that Nucla can have fireworks on the Fourth of July. When he heard about a new type of hormone therapy, he flew to California to attend two days of classes, and now he compounds medicine for four transgendered patients who live in various parts of the West. Every three months, Don talks with them on the phone and prepares their drugs; he finds this interesting. On Friday nights, he announces Nucla High football games. Reading through The New Yorker’s Colorado coverage, it’s clear that the magazine has been attracted not just to the reality of Colorado, but to the mythology of it, too. And who wouldn’t be? It’s no wonder that both the Republicans and the Democrats want to feel at home there. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Live Chat: The Second Obama-Romney Debate,33401,"Barack Obama and Mitt Romney faced off on Tuesday in the second of three Presidential debates. The New Yorker writers David Grann, Rebecca Mead, Tad Friend, and Alex Koppelman discussed the debate with readers as it happened. A transcript of the discussion follows. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Hello, and welcome to our live chat for the second debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. I’ll be joined by Tad Friend, David Grann, and Rebecca Mead. We’re getting ready for the debate to begin; it starts at 9 ET. REBECCA MEAD: Hi, Alex; hi everyone else. DAVID GRANN: hi everyone glad to be here… ALEX KOPPELMAN: Hi, guys. Any last minute pre-debate thoughts? DAVID GRANN: For once all the Super Bowl hype may not be wrong: the debate really is critical. REBECCA MEAD: feverishly trying to finish eating dinner so I can start typing is my last minute pre-debate thought DAVID GRANN: With polls so close at this late date, even a small shift in public opinion could affect outcome of the election. TAD FRIEND: Hi all—I’m with Rebecca, in the bolting-pasta-while-half-watching-Rachel-Maddow camp. DAVID GRANN: These countdown clocks always make me feel like I should be heading into the basement. ALEX KOPPELMAN: I managed to finish my pad see ew a few minutes ago, fortunately. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Do we still have that option, David? I could go for that. REBECCA MEAD: I do wonder about Candy Crowley promising the audience it’s going to be “fun.” Is that what we are here for? TAD FRIEND: My question: how did they find 80 people who still haven’t made up their minds to fill the audience? VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" ALEX KOPPELMAN: And I agree about this debate being critical: I think Obama has to re-define Romney, the way he’d defined him before the last debate, in order to really make a difference tonight. DAVID GRANN: I’ve already heard on cable 10 football metaphors and 3 baseball metaphors TAD FRIEND: It’s a horse race, too REBECCA MEAD: I’ll be providing the cricketing metaphors REBECCA MEAD: I’m anticipating a sticky wicket for Obama ALEX KOPPELMAN: Prevent defense, touchdown, home run, strike out, hail mary—what have I missed? TAD FRIEND: I believe we’re rounding the final turn and both jockeys are reaching for the whip ALEX KOPPELMAN: And away we go… DAVID GRANN: It’s that odd time of year when the whole nation becomes drama critics. QUESTION FROM CHRIS COOMEY: What’s the line on this? QUESTION FROM WELLERINLA: Over/Under 3 gaffes and a blunder! TAD FRIEND: I’d take the under on sarcastic laughter and “malarkeys” ALEX KOPPELMAN: First question from a college student, first-time voter: wants reassurance about his employment prospects after he graduates. QUESTION FROM ANGELA: oh boy. here we go with the personal anecdotes. DAVID GRANN: Find it strange that American debates seem to resolve around things not said: sighs, laughs, glances at watches. TAD FRIEND: I also bet Romney will name check at least three other swing states besides Pennsylvania DAVID GRANN: Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio…. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney’s discussion on education is interesting, I think, for how much it focuses on the role of government. TAD FRIEND: As opposed to French or Indonesian debates, David? REBECCA MEAD: When you come out in 2014, call me, Jeremy. ALEX KOPPELMAN: “More debt and less jobs. I’m going to change that.” There’s your bumper sticker line for Mitt tonight. REBECCA MEAD: Jeremy has an internship at the White House lined up if Romney wins. TAD FRIEND: Obama already moving closer to the audience, trying to re-establish his connectedness QUESTION FROM DUNCAN: Romney’s answer: “trust me.” REBECCA MEAD: Obama takes his first swipe at Romney—for wanting to allow Detroit to fail. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Number one on Obama’s list of plans is manufacturing, supposedly. But, as Rebecca said, it’s really about hitting Romney on Detroit. TAD FRIEND: Find myself hypnotized by the green “time remaining clock”—it’s like the orchestra conductor’s baton at the Oscars QUESTION FROM GREG: I don’t know that this guy with a college degree is going to want a manufacturing job. DAVID GRANN: Obama is not Bill Clinton in this format, but he is already crisper… ALEX KOPPELMAN: Here’s a follow-up from Candy Crowley. Before today, this wasn’t allowed under the debate rules. TAD FRIEND: The staging here is a bit Beckett-like—[pause as he moves forward and does not speak] REBECCA MEAD: I feel so sad for Jeremy that all of his professors are telling him there’s no job out there for him. No-one offering anything positive at all? QUESTION FROM RYAN: Is anyone Bill Clinton in this format? That man could sell a space heater to the devil. DAVID GRANN: To say that Obama took the auto industry bankrupt takes—well, brass. TAD FRIEND: Now Romney is taking credit for the auto bailout? The noive! ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney replying to Obama on Detroit now: “when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.” REBECCA MEAD: Gloves off. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney’s response on Detroit didn’t have a direct relationship to the truth, really. But it was still pretty good, I think. Confuses the issue. Obama’s coming back well now, though. TAD FRIEND: Obama is—overworked sporting metaphor alert—working the belly here, a lot of blows to the midsection, aka to reach the middle class. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney looking upset already as he tries to get Crowley to give him time to respond to Obama. She keeps control, though. REBECCA MEAD: Romney’s so alpha, he can’t believe Crowley stood up to him and forced him to stand down. It’s probably never happened before. ALEX KOPPELMAN: New question: is the job of the Energy Department to help lower gas prices? My prediction: no way Obama answers this question directly. TAD FRIEND: I think walking around helps Obama, as it did in this same debate with McCain—he likes to prowl. It’s the old law professor in him. QUESTION FROM TROY: I don’t buy that there are this many people who are undecided. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Candy Crowley is no Jim Lehrer QUESTION FROM DUNCAN: This “energy self-sufficiency” line rings hollow. Kentucky’s selling coal to India, because energy’s traded on world markets. What, short of nationalizing the petro-companies, is going to change that? TAD FRIEND: Obama advisors hoping America understands it’s “cede,” not “seed.” ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney responding now: says oil production and gas production really down under Obama. TAD FRIEND: Romney—“This is not Mr. Coal. I am King Coal!” REBECCA MEAD: See, for some of us, bringing in a migratory bird act sounds like a good thing. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney now starting to hit Obama on coal. This has been a big thing for his campaign: you talk about coal, then you talk about people in key parts of a couple potentially pivotal swing states—Virginia, Pennsylvania, etc. TAD FRIEND: That’s Romney’s dog whistle to the “spotted owl” haters, don’t you think, Rebecca? REBECCA MEAD: You got it, Tad. QUESTION FROM TYLER: It’s a bit striking how both sides are proudly talking about increasing gas resources while the issues of global warming become more and more apparent. Romney even directly attacked the idea of protecting an endangered species. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Although he didn’t say it at all last debate, he can’t just say “what Gov Romney just said, simply wasn’t true” for every answer, after a while it won’t help him REBECCA MEAD: Tyler, I was just writing the same thought. Is this the only context in which environmental issues are going to be discussed? TAD FRIEND: Now they’re toe to toe, but looking in opposite directions—kabuki boxing ALEX KOPPELMAN: I would assume so. In this economy, neither candidate has the luxury to talk about the environment. DAVID GRANN: This is an extraordinary moment… ALEX KOPPELMAN: Whoa. Fight! DAVID GRANN: Who can fact check this? REBECCA MEAD: Candy’s making a strategic decision to let the fight happen TAD FRIEND: I so long for a deus ex machina to come down and fact check here REBECCA MEAD: I can’t watch Romney in this format without thinking of that story of him as a school bully. ALEX KOPPELMAN: They’re now just interrupting each other constantly. This is fun. Question is whether either goes too far, and I can see Romney doing that. REBECCA MEAD: yes, I’m predictably partisan. QUESTION FROM MATT: Politifact: Under Obama domestic oil production is at an eight-year high—Mostly True QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Body language suddenly all-important, they’re jostling for position, strategic sitting. QUESTION FROM NATHAN: Politifact Gas Prices TAD FRIEND: Thanks for that, Matt QUESTION FROM DUNCAN: Yale, Pew surveys seem to indicate climate change doesn’t move the needle for more than 8-10% of electorate. My guess is they’re already in Obama’s 47%, so these two won’t touch that issue. REBECCA MEAD: Obama gets the first ironical laugh of the evening. TAD FRIEND: Romney is being more aggressive, but I feel Obama is ahead on fluidity and contextual thinking ALEX KOPPELMAN: Tad, I think you’re right about that—but do fluidity and contextual thinking win a debate like this one? DAVID GRANN: Romney trying to tie Obama to every trouble of last four years. Obama trying to tie Romney to every trouble of Bush four years. DAVID GRANN: Romney is like a hall monitor when it comes to debate protocol. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Obama: “I’m used to being interrupted.” TAD FRIEND: It’s time for Candy to step back in on Romney—but then she cuts off what was going to be a planned Obama zinger DAVID GRANN: Obama has nice moment when he says to questioner, “You’re doing great.” TAD FRIEND: Alex, I think fluidity and contextual thinking do shine through if the other guy seems dogmatic and bullying, which Romney so far does ALEX KOPPELMAN: New question: Romney being asked about deductions he might get rid of. We’ll see whether she can really pin him down, force him to get specific. My guess? Nope. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney talking about getting relief to middle-income families. He’s protecting himself here from what is likely to come: Obama citing study that shows Romney’s plan will raise taxes on middle-class. QUESTION FROM PATRICKB: This is an interesting dance that Romney is doing… REBECCA MEAD: “no tax on your savings.” because everybody has those, right? TAD FRIEND: 25,000—how about 100,000? If you’re picking a number. So what if it drives up the deficit? QUESTION FROM CRAIG BROWN: Romey’s tone is very ragged, he doesn’t to have the momentum of last time. QUESTION FROM PATRICKB: Obama will need to steal a page from the Biden playbook if Romney doesn’t get specific—the math doesn’t add up! TAD FRIEND: Middle class people with large stock portfolios are definitely going to vote for Romney now ALEX KOPPELMAN: At this point, Romney’s promises are just plain contradictory. He simply can’t do everything he promises—cut taxes, reduce the deficit, increase defense budget. QUESTION FROM SKLANDOG: Consider Mitt has a lot working against him. He’ll have a tough time topping his last performance, and conversely, Obama will have a tough time doing worse. QUESTION FROM DARKO: $25k limit on itemized deductions? This is about as specific as Romney’s ever gotten on this issue. DAVID GRANN: I think Skiandog is right about expectations game favoring Obama, but he also has a bigger hole to climb out of…. QUESTION FROM DUNCAN: “Moral obligation to the next generation” always makes me hope the followup question is on climate change. (It never is.) TAD FRIEND: Another body blow to the midsection from Obama—message: “he’s a trickle down fat cat.” REBECCA MEAD: Obama is the best he’s been all night on this question. Laying credible claim to moral authority. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Obama’s tax cut is much more clearer than Romney’s, he breaks it down by amounts and percentages, Romney’s is garbled and unclear QUESTION FROM BRIDGET: Obama… hitting it for six here, cricketers! REBECCA MEAD: “The top five percent will continue to pay sixty percent”—by paying 14%. ALEX KOPPELMAN: “Governor Romney, I’m sure you’ve got a reply there.” Not the nicest tone from Candy Crowley. TAD FRIEND: Top 5 per cent have more than 60 per cent of the nation’s money, though, right? Someone supply us with the actual percentage of wealth, please, truthsquadders? QUESTION FROM KIERAN: http://www.epi.org/publication/top_5_holds_more_than_half_of_the_countrys_wealth/ QUESTION FROM VALERIE D.: Only 3 questions from the audience so far… REBECCA MEAD: Obama giving some hard (and big) numbers here. TAD FRIEND: According to Kieran’s link, top 5 per cent held 63.5 per cent in 2009—and it’s surely higher now. DAVID GRANN: Obama went there—-Romney’s tax rate. ALEX KOPPELMAN: I’m never entirely sure why Obama talks so much about the cost of Romney’s tax cut. It doesn’t ever really get him anywhere, and it emphasizes how big the tax cut is. Just focus on the fact that Romney’s math doesn’t work, and he doesn’t have specifics. TAD FRIEND: Good point, Alex. REBECCA MEAD: Romney just hovering while Obama speaks. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Thanks, Tad. And while I’m on the subject, a little self-promotion—this goes to an article I wrote earlier today about why Obama really does need a teleprompter for these debates. TAD FRIEND: Q: If, somehow, magically, weirdly, in some crazy, bizarro universe—I know it’s impossible!—but your numbers didn’t add up, then what? A: His numbers don’t add up. TAD FRIEND: Neither man willing to cede—or seed—the microphone. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney just bragged about how he balanced the budget of the Olympics he ran. What he doesn’t mention: he balanced that budget with the help of a ton of federal money. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Very interesting question from the audience: what are you going to do about wage disparities between the genders? Have to admit, I didn’t expect this. QUESTION FROM MATT: P.S. Politifact: Obama’s claim that Romney’s tax plan doesn’t add up—Mostly True QUESTION FROM ANGELA: Candy is no Martha. DAVID GRANN: Thanks Matt! QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: alex, you’re so nitpicky REBECCA MEAD: Women’s inequality is “not just a women’s issue.” Thank you, President Obama. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Guilty, Stephanie. TAD FRIEND: Yes, Angela, but it’s structurally harder, as they’re further away from her and she can’t glare them down the way Martha Raddatz did. QUESTION FROM JAMIE F: Great question about equal pay, but do we really think she’s an undecided voter? TAD FRIEND: Can’t wait to hear Romney’s answer on pay equity TAD FRIEND: “one which I learned a great deal about—because I wasn’t previously aware that women could have jobs.” DAVID GRANN: Did Obama mention whether Romney supports Ledbetter or not? REBECCA MEAD: Do you think the fact that Romney’s state had more women in leadership positions has anything to do with it being a traditionally liberal state? ALEX KOPPELMAN: Oh, man. Romney talking about WOMEN who need to get home to take care of their kids. But the point is disparity—it’s not just women who take care of kids. And that stereotype is part of the problem. QUESTION FROM MIKE: Did Romney just put women back in the kitchen to take care of their children? QUESTION FROM JIM, BOSTON: Mass may be a liberal state, but we’ve never elected a woman to statewide office. The establishment can still be pretty neanderthal. TAD FRIEND: Nice segue from pay equity to healthcare AND, implicitly, abortion REBECCA MEAD: Right, Tad. Let’s make it explicit. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Obama slams Romney on Ledbetter act, brings up his answer on whether he supports it: “I’ll get back to you.” REBECCA MEAD: So pleased to see Obama making a case that “women’s issues” are family issues, economic issues—everyone’s issues. TAD FRIEND: Showing my biases here, but Obama is just thinking in a much more interesting way about this question than Romney did. DAVID GRANN: This part of the debate is very instructive whether you are Republican or Democrat; highlights the real differences between parties’ public policies. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Getting into contraception now necessary for Obama. Says to the women in the Democratic base: remember, even if you don’t love me, there’s a reason you need to vote for me in November. DAVID GRANN: There’s the ONE undecided voter! ALEX KOPPELMAN: Question: what is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush? TAD FRIEND: Romney is practically waving a copy of Robert’s Rules of Order ALEX KOPPELMAN: That last questioner was on Obama’s campaign staff, right? QUESTION FROM JORDAN: We get it Romney, you have a 5-point plan! TAD FRIEND: That’s it? President Bush and I are different people and these are different times? And trade with Latin America? QUESTION FROM GARGANTUA: Alex, why would an Obama staffer want to give Romney an opportunity to differentiate himself from W? ALEX KOPPELMAN: I don’t think he’ll be able to, really. It’s very difficult. And just the question reminds people of the connection, which is a key Obama message. DAVID GRANN: This is Romney’s attempt at a Sister Souljah moment. QUESTION FROM CHARLES: http://www.politifact.com/subjects/Contraception/ QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Romney—Throwing Bush & other Republicans under the bus. TAD FRIEND: Obama will now re-establish the link: Bush and Romney are both top-downers. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Yes. He’ll also blame Bush for the recession, and presumably say we’d be going back to the policies that caused the recession. That is, if he can ever stop talking about China and trade. Seems like a potential missed opportunity here. DAVID GRANN: Obama trying to aggressively challenge Romney without seeming unpresidential. REBECCA MEAD: Obama is speaking in declarative sentences tonight, rather than delivering the convoluted professorial inquiries he did in the last debate. TAD FRIEND: Romney looks unsettled in the reaction shots—I have Obama ahead on points (because it’s a boxing match). DAVID GRANN: Obama seemed prepared for Romney distancing himself from Bush. This was his strongest answer. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Obama talking about the distinctions between Romney and Bush—and using that to hit Romney—his best moment of these two debates so far. Really, really strong. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Switching it up—new question fits perfectly with a Romney campaign theme. What have you accomplished? I’m not as optimistic now as I was when you were elected. QUESTION FROM GUEST: that hissing sound you hear? collective sigh of relief emanating from just left of center. TAD FRIEND: An interesting question for Obama would be: Are *you as optimistic as you were in 2008? DAVID GRANN: yes; a good question and forces Obama to address his second term, something he has not done that clearly during the campaign. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Agreed; I’d love to hear an answer to that. (I’d really love to hear a totally honest answer to that, but can’t imagine we’d get that while he’s still in office.) REBECCA MEAD: I cannot wait for Obama’s memoirs. Well, I can wait another four years. ALEX KOPPELMAN: “If you elect President Obama, you know what you’re going to get. You’re going to get a repeat of the last four years.” Pretty good message from Romney there. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: I wish the audience questioners would be asked if the answer satisfied them or not. TAD FRIEND: Yes, this is a good moment for Romney. DAVID GRANN: Romney: Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. TAD FRIEND: Obama: remember Clinton? That’s me! Romney: remember Reagan? That’s me. ALEX KOPPELMAN: That bit by Romney was devastating—not just because Romney delivered it so well, but because people blame Presidents for the economy, and vote that way, and Romney made a really strong case for how bad the economy has been under Obama’s watch. DAVID GRANN: General Election Romney walking back Primary Romney. REBECCA MEAD: Agreed. Romney’s best moment all night, and a very strong one. TAD FRIEND: Romney makes employment verification and employer sanctions sound like a giveback: “What I *will* do, on the other hand …” ALEX KOPPELMAN: David makes a good point: Romney had tacked hard to the right on immigration to please Republican primary voters, but now he needs Latino voters in key swing states—Nevada, Colorado, Florida, etc—so he’s heading as far back to the center as he can. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL BETTI: No amnesty for the Mexican equivalent of big bird. darn QUESTION FROM ANGELA: David—yes! Etch-a-Sketch. QUESTION FROM ANNA: Is “Lorraine” really that difficult to pronounce? TAD FRIEND: I think Obama is going to sell better as the child of immigrants than Romney . .. . TAD FRIEND: Anna, it’s “Glorena,” apparently. TAD FRIEND: Obama is actually answering Lorraine/Lorena’s question. TAD FRIEND: Is it just me, or does Romney, in his dealings with Candy Crowley, seem like a, oh, what’s the word … dick? REBECCA MEAD: I guess Obama decided not to bring up Romney’s statement about how his life would be easier if he were Mexican. ALEX KOPPELMAN: I’m not sure how well what Obama said about it not being his fault he didn’t get comprehensive immigration reform passed plays. He promised to get it done; he didn’t. And he really, really needs Latino voters. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL BETTI: Tad, you’re being too kind. QUESTION FROM WELLERINLA: Tad Friend is now my hero. Period. Who won the debate, friends? Tad Friend. DAVID GRANN: Did Candy Crowely just order Romney to sit down? ALEX KOPPELMAN: “I don’t look at my pension, it’s not as big as yours, so it doesn’t take as long.” Obama responding to Romney going after him. TAD FRIEND: Candy actually sent Romney to the principal’s office DAVID GRANN: How do you think Romney’s aggressive style is playing? ALEX KOPPELMAN: Was just about to ask that same question, David. I hate talking about candidates’ demeanor, but I think it’s important here. He was likable in the first debate, and badly needed to be. And now he just seems… nasty. QUESTION FROM ROB F.: It is making one undecided voter, me, concerned for his ability to handle pressurized situations. QUESTION FROM MASTER DEBATOR: The aggressiveness toward Obama is probably going over alright with his base, but there seems to be a large spillover directed at the moderator that doesn’t look as good. TAD FRIEND: The Libya question is a tough one for Obama, but so far he’s handling it well. Romney’s going to feast on it like a juicy steak. DAVID GRANN: Obama pivots well from a tricky question. ALEX KOPPELMAN: “We are going to find out who did this and we are going to hunt them down,” Obama just said, re. Benghazi. There have been rumors of a retaliatory strike somewhere in Libya; that comment adds more than a little fuel to the fire. TAD FRIEND: I actually like talking about candidates’ demeanors, and it almost seems like Romney has a pumped-up Patrick Swayze in his ear saying “Nobody puts Baby in a corner!” ALEX KOPPELMAN: Tad, let me guess: you watching Dirty Dancing when it was on TV on Sunday? TAD FRIEND: Did I miss it? Damnation! QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: Romney decrying Obama’s actions when Romney’s statements in the immediate aftermath of the libya murders were universally panned. REBECCA MEAD: Romney calls Obama’s post-election visit to the Middle East an “apology tour.” TAD FRIEND: Obama is getting chesty, it’s his Harry Truman moment. TAD FRIEND: I think Obama is right to suggest, here, that Romney is playing politics with the Libya issue. REBECCA MEAD: Do you think that Hillary was made to say “it was my responsibility” so that Obama could come out tonight and say “It was my responsibility.” ALEX KOPPELMAN: Earlier today, I saw a conservative on Twitter (sorry, don’t remember who) predict what just happened exactly: Clinton’s taking blame for Benghazi becomes a moment for Obama to say “the buck stops with me.” Predictable, a little too political, but smart. DAVID GRANN: Candy Crowley: fact checker! ALEX KOPPELMAN: “Please proceed, Governor.” Obama says to Romney, totally throws Romney off his game for a second. QUESTION FROM PAT: How about that crowd reaction? QUESTION FROM KEVIN: this crowd doesn’t seem undecided anymore DAVID GRANN: It is a far more enlightening debate when two people appear. REBECCA MEAD: Good question on assault weapons. REBECCA MEAD: 100,000 people are shot in America each year: over 9 thousand fatalities TAD FRIEND: Any question about “What has your administration done …” is automatically good for Romney, because he can point out failures and promise the moon. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Agreed, Rebecca, it’s a good question. But I think Obama will stay very far away from a real answer; Democrats have given up on gun control—they’re scared of how it can hurt them politically. REBECCA MEAD: That’s right, Alex, and it’s a national shame. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Yup. QUESTION FROM DUNCAN: Gun control platitudes. Does anyone think either administration is going to do anything, at all? Even less room here than climate change. TAD FRIEND: This is not Obama’s strong suit—both parties have totally ducked this one. So it’ll be interesting to see where Romney takes it … and he takes it to “enforcement” and the “culture of violence.” Yep, that’ll do it. TAD FRIEND: Better parenting will totally stop a semi-automatic weapon. REBECCA MEAD: Rings, not guns. ALEX KOPPELMAN: The funny—not funny ha-ha, certainly, but funny—thing about this part of the debate is that, in terms of what they actually accomplished while in office, Romney’s further to the left on gun control than Obama is. QUESTION FROM FRED: Because most AK-47s come with a “two parent household” safety lock QUESTION FROM ROB F.: A doctoral candidate raised by two parents opened fire in a movie theater as I recall. DAVID GRANN: This will be interesting… ALEX KOPPELMAN: Crowley jumps in, asks Obama to explain why he changed his mind on assault weapons ban. DAVID GRANN: kinda weird. feels like Romney is locked in a debate with Candy Crowley. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney’s answer, typical for his line on policies he supported in Mass. that he no longer supports: “well, it was bipartisan, so it was fine.” He never addresses the substance, though. TAD FRIEND: Candy Crowley should be wearing plastic gloves so she can push the two bloody battlers apart. QUESTION FROM JEANNE: How come she will forcibly stop Romney but not Obama? stick to your guns, candy and make Obama be quiet ON TIME. QUESTION FROM MATT: Obama knows when and how to step down. Gets his points in, but respects Candy. TAD FRIEND: My guess is Obama and Romney now like each other 25 per cent less than they did at 9 pm. DAVID GRANN: How do you think Candy Crowley has done as a moderator? REBECCA MEAD: Also Obama wasn’t just avoiding the question—his argument was a holistic one about guns and education. ALEX KOPPELMAN: A question about outsourcing. Romney’s doing OK on it so far, but this is turf that favors Obama. He’s just waiting to pounce and talk about Bain. QUESTION FROM NAT: She’s managed the time much, much better. TAD FRIEND: I’d give Candy Crowley a B. She needed to jump in early and take control. QUESTION FROM MATT: David, Candy has done well in a situation where the moderator should be secondary. This is supposed to be led by the audience and she’s facilitated well. QUESTION FROM DECIDED VOTER: Candy has done a good job. No moderator I’ve ever seen has been successful in holding presidential candidates to a buzzer, but she has held them from going on forever and reminded them of the question when needed. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney says Obamacare has been a deterrent to hiring, which is just not at all supportable. But it’s a good line. QUESTION FROM NATE: Candy, I watched Martha Raddatz. I knew Martha Raddatz. Martha Raddatz was a friend of mine. Candy, you’re no Martha Raddatz. TAD FRIEND: Isn’t Obama missing an easy Bain-slamming line here re outsourcing? ALEX KOPPELMAN: Yeah, I think so, Tad. And his answer on this question is remarkably flat. Not a great note to end on. QUESTION FROM PATRICKB: Obama is absolutely missing some easy points. Lots of them. I’m baffled at how terrible he is handling this. TAD FRIEND: I think Obama, like Biden last week, started very strong and petered out toward the end. But still the winner. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Obama interrupts Romney to ask Crowley how much time is remaining—we’re coming close to the end of the debate. TAD FRIEND: Obama is better when he gets angry, as he did on the LIbya question. Romney is worse. DAVID GRANN: A chance for candidates to transcend their caricatures. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Questioner: “I think this is a tough question.” He’s wrong. REBECCA MEAD: Questioner asks what is the biggest misperception each candidate labors under. I hope Obama says “that I was born out of the United States; that I am a Muslim.” TAD FRIEND: So Obama never used “47 per cent”? What’s he waiting for—the fourth debate? TAD FRIEND: Rebecca, he’ll never do it. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Romney: “I care about 100 percent of the American people.” Maybe he’s sincere, but doesn’t really sound like he is. DAVID GRANN: Romney’s most effective line: “We don’t have to settle for what we’re going through.” TAD FRIEND: Interesting—Obama is coming out as a capitalist. QUESTION FROM EMCEED: Government does not create jobs?! Then why are you running for president?! Aren’t you saying you will create 12 million new jobs, Mr. Etch-a-Sketch? QUESTION FROM PETER KAUFMAN: Romney: “message: I care” TAD FRIEND: There it is—the 47 per cent! DAVID GRANN: With seconds left he says it: 47 percent. REBECCA MEAD: Obama raises the 47%—he saved the best for last. QUESTION FROM TOM (AUSTRALIA): here it is… HERE IT IS! ITS HERE! QUESTION FROM VARUN: Now that 47% has been mentioned, I guess i have to down my drink TAD FRIEND: It’s a Hail Mary—only he’s already ahead. QUESTION FROM PAT: Nothing wrong with running up the score a little Tad. TAD FRIEND: Briefest handshake ever DAVID GRANN: He clearly saved that to end, so Romney would not have a reply. REBECCA MEAD: Not a hail Mary—I think a strategic choice. Didn’t want to seem hectoring earlier. Knew he’d have a chance to do it at the end. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Good point, David. Romney did a similar thing last time, hitting Obama on the sequester. ALEX KOPPELMAN: OK, everyone: final thoughts? TAD FRIEND: Yes, I think you guys are right—just wanted to call back the Hail Mary idea, the last-second sports metaphor QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Thanks New Yorker, Obama narrow win for me, missed chances on both sides, no striking lead for either overall. TAD FRIEND: Obama won by a small but vital margin, I’d say. QUESTION FROM LOUISE: Thought it very, very close. Obama ahead but not by a lot. DAVID GRANN: I suspect both parties will have stuff to be happy with their candidates. But Obama seemed to stop his free fall. ALEX KOPPELMAN: So far, I don’t see any of our readers saying they thought Romney won. Anyone? QUESTION FROM NISHAT: I believe Obama won, but the polls will reflect the polarization. Thank you New Yorker! TAD FRIEND: Our readers are not exactly a cross-section of America. ALEX KOPPELMAN: I think Obama wins too. But I wonder how much of a difference it will make; I don’t think it can have the impact Romney’s win in the last debate did. REBECCA MEAD: I agree, Alex. But the narrative will change, which journalists everywhere can be grateful for. TAD FRIEND: He had to win, though. And it sets up the rubber match next Monday! QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Obama couldn’t lose, and Romney couldn’t win based on expectations. QUESTION FROM THOMAS: Romney won, hands down, it was the “binder full of women” that did it. What did Obama have to compare with that? ALEX KOPPELMAN: Yes, Rebecca. Question is, what narrative does the media want coming out of the next debate? What makes for the best story? QUESTION FROM DUVROCK: Romney looked strong. Impressive. REBECCA MEAD: Alex—nail-biting finish, naturally. QUESTION FROM NATHAN: Writing from a newsroom full of journalists, I can say that the Republicans are dejected, and the Democrats are poking fun at Romney. TAD FRIEND: It comes down to “As we’re back to where we were four years ago, does that mean we’re better off, or falling behind?” ALEX KOPPELMAN: Ah, yes, of course, Rebecca. Bonus: that means more ad time bought on local TV. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Seems like we’re just about done for the night, unless anyone else has something to add. If not, we’ll move the discussion to Twitter: follow us at @newyorker, @tadfriend, @davidgrann, @rebeccamead_nyc and @alexkoppelman. And thanks very much to everyone for being here, especially our readers—really appreciate all the great comments. REBECCA MEAD: Good night, everyone. DAVID GRANN: Good night everyone!! TAD FRIEND: Enjoyed the chat! QUESTION FROM RYAN: Thank you everyone. You’ve made the debate—and election—so much more enjoyable for this Canadian. ALEX KOPPELMAN: Good night, all.

Live Chat: The Vice-Presidential Debate,39218,"On Thursday night, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan took part in the lone Vice-Presidential debate of the campaign, at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Read what New Yorker writers and editors Ryan Lizza, Amy Davidson, and Nicholas Thompson had to say about the event as it happened. AMY DAVIDSON: Hello, and welcome! We’re about to get started. The wives of the Vice-Presidential candidates have just been introduced. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: How you doing Ms. Davidson? RYAN LIZZA: Hi Amy and Nick. You guys have the popcorn ready? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Yup. Popcorn and beer, Mr. Lizza. AMY DAVIDSON: Hi Ryan and Nick! No popcorn but here are two of Ryan’s pieces: on Paul Ryan, from earlier this year, and on Biden, from 2008. QUESTION FROM ALEX: What type of beer? AMY DAVIDSON: For those with a split screen tonight, the Steelers just got a touchdown. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Dogfish (brewed in Delaware) and Milwaukee’s best. AMY DAVIDSON: And we’re about to start! Last minute predictions? Hopes, bets, fears? RYAN LIZZA: None of it will matter! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Before we get started, how are those photos from Time of Ryan going to play? RYAN LIZZA: Wow, I had not seen those! AMY DAVIDSON: I am so puzzled by those photos. Intros are beginning! The format is nine topics, each of which will get ten minutes. Biden answers first. QUESTION FROM DIN “GO MITT & PAUL” COB: Lets go Republicans QUESTION FROM PAUL: It’s a sit down. AMY DAVIDSON: And we’re beginning with Libya! QUESTION FROM DIN “GO MITT & PAUL” COB: is there an audience? RYAN LIZZA: I don’t really get why the VP candidates get to sit down. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Biden starts by answering the question, not saying hello. I like that. And a tough first question. AMY DAVIDSON: Din, yes; tickets divided one third Romney campaign, one third Obama, and the rest in a lottery to students. Also, AARP, since they sponsored. QUESTION FROM HM: Wow Biden is.. aged AMY DAVIDSON: Biden changes the subject from Benghazi to bin Laden. QUESTION FROM DIN “GO MITT & PAUL” COB: they all age AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: “The last thing we need now is another war” RYAN LIZZA: Here’s what I would ask Biden: “Vice President Biden, you voted against the first Gulf War, you voted in favor of the Iraq War, and you later advised the Bush administration to divide Iraq into three parts. You advised Obama not to intervene in Libya to save Benghazi, and you advised him not to strike Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan. Do you believe you made the correct choice on all of these foreign policy decisions? If not, which ones were you wrong about and what have you learned from your mistakes?” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Paul Ryan’s tie looks like V-Day wrapping paper AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: Why wasn’t there a Marine detachment guarding consulate in Libya? AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: need to make sure we’re not projecting weakness abroad, “and that’s what’s happening here.” QUESTION FROM D-MONEY: wow ryan going hard on libya QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Reminding Biden his son serves, necessary? Really? QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: But then you also should ask Ryan why he and his GOP counterparts denied funding for Embassy security? QUESTION FROM TIM: Laughing is not a good look for Biden RYAN LIZZA: Yes, that would be a very good question and MR should ask it. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: “with all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey” RYAN LIZZA: Biden: “Not a single thing he said is accurate.” AMY DAVIDSON: And Biden answers on embassy funding! RYAN LIZZA: Looks like someone read that Maureen Dowd column channelling Aaron Sorkin. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: That’s the first time “malarkey” was used in a debate since 1956 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Lizza: “Leading from behind” is going to come up in Paul Ryan’s response… QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Pinning him on inaccuracy is a good strategy! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Hah! What was the context in 56? I’m guessing it was Adlai. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: JOE MUST HAVE READ MY MIND AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: we weren’t hiding lack of protest; it’s what intelligence told us. QUESTION FROM TREIZE KHUSHRENADA: Bidan is doing ok so far Ryan is not losing his cool either. QUESTION FROM RC: Throw the intelligence community under the bus. Nice. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Biden is fierce and clear, so far. AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: “should the US have apologized for Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?” Ryan: “Oh Gosh, yes” But… QUESTION FROM SAM: I like Joe! QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: If the intelligence comm got it wrong they should be thrown under bus QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Ryan dodges Koran question. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Look, don’t say look too much Ryan, it’s patronising. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Good point Patrick. He half answered: apologized for the urination, not for the burning. AMY DAVIDSON: But there was, indeed, an apology allowance. QUESTION FROM A.: Much more forceful moderator. I’m a fan. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: MR is doing a good job AMY DAVIDSON: Derek, Charlie, I agree. RYAN LIZZA: I hate to be crassly political, especially because issues like Libya and Iran are incredibly important to debate, but the more the campaign is about foreign policy the less Romney is likely to win. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: It’s true. Foreign policy was one of Obama’s weaknesses in 08. He picked Biden in part to compensate. It’s one of Romney’s and yet he picked Ryan who brings no experience on FP. AMY DAVIDSON: I’m not sure talking about Ayatollahs is Ryan’s strength. Also, he seems to be saying that the Administration opposed sanctions. QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Ryan: You have our permission to be crass, thanks. QUESTION FROM MAZDAK: Why does’nt Biden emphasize that the sanctions on Iran are actually working! QUESTION FROM LINDSAY: Obama/Biden winning on smiles and old timely language QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Ryan seems to be faltering already. Hard to think he can keep this up for 90 minutes. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: It’s not in my purview to talk about classified information. But… QUESTION FROM SAM: Joe is towing the line between aggressive and patronizing. It’s risky, but I like it! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Kevin: agreed. But this is the part of the debate, foreign policy, that Biden should win. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Bidens command of language is very impressive. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: why is joe so much more confident than obama? RYAN LIZZA: Good question! QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Water count: Ryan-2 sips, Biden-0, shows Ryan’s more nervous NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Maybe he drank coffee before this debate? AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan keeps talking about ayatollahs: “what do they see?” QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: Biden is very condescending QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Spinning the centrifuges faster is very crass. RYAN LIZZA: Really? I don’t see that, watcher in nz. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: They’re referencing one of the best posts of the month on newyorker.com RYAN LIZZA: Note to commenters: no cracks about Biden’s hair will be be posted. Let’s keep in clean! QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: Biden is not being condescending he is smarter AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: “Let me tell you about what the Ayatollahs see” and: “Now with regard to Bibi…” QUESTION FROM GUEST: How can anyone say Biden is being patronizing when it is obvious that Ryan is talking silly school boy stuff. Ridiculous QUESTION FROM XAVIER: Raddatz already seems more aggressive and engaged than Lehrer was. QUESTION FROM MAZDAK: thank god Biden brought up the Iranian economy! Finally! QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Biden & Bibi in 2012! AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan again saying that Obama opposed sanctions. QUESTION FROM TREIZE: Biden is amused by Ryan’s comments! RYAN LIZZA: OK, Biden’s laughing is a little over the top and borders on condescending. QUESTION FROM GREG: Ryan looks flustered. AMY DAVIDSON: I think that Raddatz knows the enrichment timeline better than either of them. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: So far: Raddatz vastly better than Lehrer; Biden vastly better than Obama; Romney vastly better than Ryan. QUESTION FROM XAVIER: Ryan or Amy? Which sanctions did Obama oppose? RYAN LIZZA: I like Raddatz’s style a lot—keeping it like a conversation but also asking challenging questions and moving things along. AMY DAVIDSON: The Administration has actually pushed sanctions… QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: Agree Nicholas QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Great question by moderator! QUESTION FROM GREG: I’m ready to vote for Raddatz. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: “War should always be the last resort” —Biden RYAN LIZZA: So far the pundits’ predictions that these two guys would focus like a laser on Obama and Romney appears not to be the case. QUESTION FROM PHYLLIS: What the heck is this fixation on condescending tone? Is that because Biden is really strongly making his case and Ryan has no depth. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: Raddatz 2016 QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Put your seat belts on folks, here we go…. RYAN LIZZA: Wow, that’s a pretty big promise: unemployment under 6 %. No date given but presumably he means in a second term. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: Already the 47 %! “These people are my mom and dad” QUESTION FROM EMMA95: Finally! the 47% mentioned! QUESTION FROM WOLF: Already one more mention of the auto bailout vs. last week AMY DAVIDSON: Biden on fire on the 47 % QUESTION FROM GREG: I hope Obama is taking notes. Biden putting on a clinic. QUESTION FROM DAN: go joe go. boom! 47% and more taxes than romney. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden also gets in Romney’s effective tax rate QUESTION FROM DAN: Boom! And onto Grover’s pledge. Biden is on fire. QUESTION FROM SKLANDOG: into the debating season and 47% finally comes up QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: at least biden’s come out fighting! yeah! QUESTION FROM BOB: Finally! Biden nails him with facts and fire! QUESTION FROM XAVIER: So now the unemployment rate is whatever Ryan says it is? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Ryan’s attack about Scranton was obviously planned, and weirdly weak. AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan does not touch the 47%. Instead, the unemployment rate, and defends “job creators” AMY DAVIDSON: Whoa. Is Ryan talking about Romney’s charity for a family that had children hurt in car crash? Does he know Biden’s bio? QUESTION FROM WOLF: Make more things in America?! From Romney-Ryan?! Biden cannot let that go QUESTION FROM CHRIS: “Romney’s a car guy!” QUESTION FROM OBERYN MARTELL: Will Romney do that for every kid in America? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Very good line from Ryan dinging VP on his bloopers. QUESTION FROM KATE C: Ryan is not at all sincere talking about Romney. AMY DAVIDSON: And Biden does bring up his personal history. That was a mistake by Ryan. QUESTION FROM ATX: Kinda painful for Ryan to talk about a family being killed in a car crash. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Amy, agreed. Set up by Ryan. QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Now America must rely on Romney’s tithing? QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: he doesn’t tell these stories, because you will mr ryan QUESTION FROM ALISSA: Wow, Biden is really Going There. QUESTION FROM MJ: Biden is really composed and seems so much more mature+wise next to Ryan. QUESTION FROM PHYLLIS: If Romney needs Ryan to tell stories that he is really human that is sad. QUESTION FROM ELINOR: I didn’t hear Biden say Mitt lacked any good qualities. He criticized the condescension of the 47% speech. RYAN LIZZA: I am not a fan of candidates bringing up personal tragedies like that in the middle of political debates. I think I may have missed what precipitated it, though. What did Ryan say? AMY DAVIDSON: I’m stunned that Ryan doesn’t acknowledge Biden’s loss. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: Biden’s been a brick wall against Ryan’s attacks. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Ryan talked about a family that had been hurt in a car crash and the compassion that Romney showed them. Biden had to come back. And yes, Amy, absolutely. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: ooh that was painful to hear him talk about his family and the car crash..felt real for a moment there RYAN LIZZA: OK, that makes it justifiable. AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan, not justifiable—necessary. QUESTION FROM BRUCE: I’m looking forward to Raditz go after Ryan’s budget. QUESTION FROM MJ: I love Biden “I love my friend here!” He’s really likable. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: BOOM ! Pulling out the stimulus letters NICHOLAS THOMPSON: The classic piece on Paul Ryan, the stimulus, and his district. QUESTION FROM GUEST: ‘Show us a program; take some responsibility’ QUESTION FROM JAMES: Good idea for Biden to casually bring up Ryan’s request for stimulus. QUESTION FROM WOLF: Biden ate the cheshire cat. I kinda love it AMY DAVIDSON: Now Medicare QUESTION FROM CHRIS: “I wish he would just tell the tru…Be a little more candid.” Well put, Joe. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Ryan looks weak on the stimulus stuff, no real response there. AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: Medicare was there for my family; I got Social Security benefits. “We will honor this promise”—but not for future generations, just ones who’ve already been promised? RYAN LIZZA: “We’ve all had tragedies in our lives.” This is true, but seems weird if it’s a response to Biden mentioning the car crash that killed his wife and children. QUESTION FROM GREG: Biden is engaging and in flux; Ryan has predetermined responses. He’s speaking, not talking. QUESTION FROM WOLF: Big test. The 716 dishonesty appears again. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: This is much more fun to watch than the Biden/Palin debate. In that one, Biden was clear and sharp, but much calmer and so worried about looking like a bully. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: he said that ‘we’ve all had tragedies’ so casually and with no empathy, what a jerk QUESTION FROM KIERAN: A who’s-had-the-worse-tragedy off? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Kieran, if it’s that, it’s a terrible idea for Ryan. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Ryan concise on Medicare though, outlines it better than Romney. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: you have more on Medicare than you used to. Also: vouchers! QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: if there was an emergency, i’d trust biden. QUESTION FROM PHYLLIS: Why do Romney/Ryan continue to repeat lies about what has been fact checked? I really hate this. Talk about condescending talk? This assumes that Americans are stupid. RYAN LIZZA: Paul Ryan definitely seems like he is the Chairman of the Budget Committee. Doesn’t have a real human touch as a pol. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden on who to trust on Medicare: Folks, trust your instincts on this. QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Joe is treating this as a telethon! AMY DAVIDSON: Biden must now answer on the $716 billion QUESTION FROM DAN G.: Ryan bold using the $716 billion line given his 2010 budget had the same rate reductions. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: biden is very convincing, he seems to have integrity, great talking to camera QUESTION FROM KIERAN: oooh bickering! QUESTION FROM EMMA95: I love this! it’s scrabbling, but not petty. Like a sitcom RYAN LIZZA: Biden now rattling Ryan. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: There’s not one democrat who supports the Ryan plan. QUESTION FROM JAMES: Don’t think Ryan meant to use duress in that way… QUESTION FROM GUEST: Embarrassed to think Paul is from my state. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Biden fact-checking Ryan on the fly. QUESTION FROM RACHEL: Emma, totally agree! So entertaining. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: great interruptions from biden QUESTION FROM JOHN FRAM: Ryan evading!!!! RYAN LIZZA: If Obama-Biden lose election, Biden could land at PolitiFact. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: this is a great debate, these guys are both alive at least, unlike canned romney and obama having a senior moment AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz reminds Ryan that he wanted to privatize Social Security. “For younger Americans,” he confirms. QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Is Joe losing the folks with details? QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: GOOD Question MR about SS privitization QUESTION FROM RACHEL: You can totally tell that Raddatz is having a hard time keeping a poker face. She definitely wants to laugh. Looks painful. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: we will all get old one day, and our populations in the developed countries are getting older proportionately as well! we need help for elders, we need great healthcare for the future, it is good economic sense to do so! AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan, after scaring everyone under 55 with the privatization of Social Security & vouchers, says that Biden is scaring people. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Scaring people into voting for you is exactly what RR is doing QUESTION FROM DEREK: Ryan is starting to repeat himself… QUESTION FROM TIM: Biden got the last word on SS. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Tim, yes, that was brilliant. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: if you make a million dollars or more a year, yes, you will pay more taxes. But not middle class! RYAN LIZZA: The worst selling point of the GOP’s Medicare proposal is when they promise older voters it won’t apply to them. If you have to promise some segment of public they won’t by impacted by your wonderful new policy, the people who will be affected ought to be a little nervous. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Can we see what Ryan’s doodling? QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: Privatization of SS doesn’t scare me… I’d love it. QUESTION FROM BP: Joe Biden = Raul Ibanez ? QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: he’s doodling ‘help!’ QUESTION FROM JIM: Every time Ryan doesn’t have any come back on the topic he accuses Biden of scaring people QUESTION FROM SAM: Oh boy, let’s see what happens if Ryan refutes the 5 Trillion… QUESTION FROM GUEST: Pictures of bombs dropping on Iran? AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: government wants to take “44.8 %” of small business incomes. And “there aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax” NICHOLAS THOMPSON: BP: perfect. The old pinch-hitter comes in and saves the slugger with the massive expectations and rep. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: Where does Ryan get his stats? QUESTION FROM GREG: I’m an Orioles fan. Let’s not talk about Ibanez. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Lizza: would Pawlenty or Portman have done better here? QUESTION FROM SAM: A republican citing Canada as a positive example? My how times change… QUESTION FROM JOHN: Biden has been very strong, but just needs to tone down the laughing/smiling a little bit i think—and avoid and gaffes that would ruin his performance QUESTION FROM MAZDAK: I live in Canada and the taxes are not 15%! AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: So how are you going to pay? “Do you have the specifics?” Ryan says, in effect, no. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Ryan has lots of virtues. Talent at bipartisan legislation is not one of them. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: Ryan does have panache and excellent showmanship in the way he delivers and phrases his points- and is surprising composed RYAN LIZZA: Hmm, good question, Nick. I think they would have. I just think the Ryan budget is such a burden to have to defend. And I think they are better at the human side of politics. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Appeals to bipartisanship, blaming Democrats for intractability, so disingenuous. QUESTION FROM PODGORNEY: Listening to Ryan on taxes is like trying to drink from a fire hose. RYAN LIZZA: Biden is being very Romney-like in taking charge of things tonight. AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: Can you guarantee that the math will add up? Ryan: Absolutely! (but hasn’t done it yet.) QUESTION FROM LLEWLOCE: Sass from the moderator! Very different from the last debate.. QUESTION FROM TIM: the marginal tax rate and the actual tax rate are NOT the same thing—if a supposed tax policy wonk is mixing these two he’s either incompetent or he is blatantly misleading QUESTION FROM JOHN LUCAS: You know I was always a little worried about Joe Biden becoming president—not anymore. QUESTION FROM SEFA: @Ryan Lizza: Totally agree. He clearly learned a lot from last debate. Should be careful not to cross the line into too much QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: No specifics bad math- Does not get me excited about their plan. I am supposed to just trust them ? NO WAY! QUESTION FROM B: So she asked for specifics on how to pay for the 20% tax cuts across the board from Ryan…and got none. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: specifics are important, but they have to verifiable, not just pie in the sky NICHOLAS THOMPSON: I think Biden watched Jon Stewart Tuesday night on the Ryan budget. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden using Reagan against Ryan—nice touch. QUESTION FROM GAIL(AUSTRALIA): Cut taxes by 20%???? How would that be possible? QUESTION FROM EMMA95: Democrats not used to bipartisanship? from a republican! Good God! QUESTION FROM CHARLES: Ryan said he’d “fill in the details”… NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Biden has been most impressive in turning Ryan’s arguments against him: Reagan, the car accident, etc… You can’t prep for all that. AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: Can you declare anything off limits? QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: close loopholes for high interest people! telling gaff, ryan RYAN LIZZA: I think this is why it’s hard to use the debates to reverse the overall dynamic of the race. It’s relatively easy to turn things around by creating a new narrative in the next debate. AMY DAVIDSON: Amusing of Biden to wonder why Romney isn’t contesting Massachusetts. AMY DAVIDSON: To a casual listener, it’s very unclear if Ryan is saying that he wants defense budget to go up or down. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Wait, Lizza. Don’t we have massive counter-evidence to that? No matter what happens tonight Romney really did change the nature of the race in the last debate. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: The moderator is pressing on specifics…great choice! cuts down on the lofty rhetoric QUESTION FROM PATRICIA ENCISO: Ryan is sounding very edgy; kinda like our son when he was sixteen and trying to argue that he was right when he was sooo wrong. QUESTION FROM SAM: I can already see the Fox News headlines: Moderator in cahoots with the Democratic Party. QUESTION FROM NUPI32TLS: This is soo good; the Romney/Ryan talking points are being seriously challenged. Great stuff QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: you’re right, ryan sounds defensive, like an antsy teenager QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: I’m all for cutting defense… But not the navy. QUESTION FROM MIKE: Isn’t this all too wonky? QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: whaoh how do those soldiers feel about those cuts? QUESTION FROM ALEXMCE: .@JoshuaGreen: Ryan seems like a guy nervously interviewing for a Rhodes Scholarship AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: Why not leave Afghanistan now? “Is it worth more American lives?” QUESTION FROM NUPI32TLS: This is not too wonky because it details what the two sides are about when it comes to governing. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Nupi: exactly. QUESTION FROM EMMA95: I hope someone mentions malala.. AMY DAVIDSON: Emma95, I do, too. QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: what gains have we gotten in afghanistan, ryan? RYAN LIZZA: Nick, I’m not convinced his bump in the polls will last. We’ll have to wait and see. But usually what happens during debate season is there’s lots of volatility in the polls but then they settle back to where they were a week before the debates. QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: Amy… No it’s not worth more lives. We need to come home and secure our OWN border… Unfortunately Obama won’t do it either. QUESTION FROM PHYLLIS: I think most Americans agree. Let us not lose any more sons and daughters in a non- winnable war NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Is Biden calling the war in Afghanistan a success? AMY DAVIDSON: Biden mentions that he’s been to Afghanistan twenty times. And that we went there because of 9/11—“that was our purpose”—now Afghans need to take responsibility. RYAN LIZZA: Here’s a nice chart summarizing that dynamic. QUESTION FROM ATX: Biden just nailed the Afghanistan question. Clear focus on purpose. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Obama and Romney will both stay in Afghanistan, we should be talking about Libya, Syria, Iran, and other potential nations America could invade in the coming months/years AMY DAVIDSON: Biden sounds like he strongly believes what he’s saying about Afghanistan. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: i don’t agree with the war in afghanistan, but i still respect biden’s position on it, and his more coherent exposition of reasons for being there QUESTION FROM CHARLES: Good to hear Biden stating the purpose, strategy and rationale for exit. QUESTION FROM DEREK: Anyone keeping count of how may times Biden has said “PERIOD”. RYAN LIZZA: The old some-of-my-best-friends-are-soldiers line. QUESTION FROM BEN: ryan wants to keep fighting, biden just wants to get out AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: ok to plan to leave, don’t tell anyone, though! QUESTION FROM KIERAN: ‘Unravelling’ doesn’t play after such a confident statement from Biden. QUESTION FROM GUEST: I agree that we need to discuss Syria. QUESTION FROM ATX: Ryan stumbles every time he tries to repeat a line that is obviously scripted. QUESTION FROM CHARLES: War is never a success and shouldn’t be measured as success and failure. RYAN LIZZA: This debate reminds me a lot of the Cheney-Edwards matchup. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Lizza: agreed. And it’s helping Biden’s 2016 chances, too! QUESTION FROM COLUMBIA MBA STUDENT: Ryan agrees on the timeline, but not on a deadline, even though the timeline has a deadline. I don’t get it? AMY DAVIDSON: Biden on Afghans, Iraqis—”they’re happy to have us keep doing the job.” Need to say, “fellows, step up.” I think that should play well. QUESTION FROM PHYLLIS: Ryan is out of his element and he is losing ground. QUESTION FROM LUIS ENRIQUE: What I find most interesting about Biden’s performance is the control of the facts, he putting them in a clear and brief narrative, his ability to rebut all arguments presented against him on the spot, and how he combines preset talking points and “buttons-to-be-pushed” with his own ideas. All with conviction, energy, strength. Most crucially, he seems to be really listening and really thinking, right there. QUESTION FROM NUPI32TLS: Biden is firm on when the U.S. will leave Afghanistan, while Ryan argues against it. Biden is right, the longer the U.S. remains, the longer she will have to remain. Out is out. QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: martha telling biden to trust her RYAN LIZZA: A lot like like Clinton, Luis. QUESTION FROM NUPI32TLS: Right on, Luis Enrique AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan now wants everyone to know that he knows what the “fighting season” is in Afghanistan. QUESTION FROM LUIS ENRIQUE: Ryan Lizza: my thoughts exactly. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: uh- Paul Ryan some of my best friends are soldiers and one of my best friends was in Libya in Tripoli so I totally resent you playing that card NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Yes. Biden—combination of Clinton and a very hungry hyena. QUESTION FROM ALEXMCE: “And, Martha, let me just remind you: I shoot arrows.” RYAN LIZZA: LOL. QUESTION FROM PODGORNEY: @Amy: yes, Ryan wants to tell us everything he knows, pertinent or not. QUESTION FROM ALEXMCE: I’m here all week, folks! RYAN LIZZA: That was an amazing exchange. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: we want Afghans to go to the most dangerous part of Afghanistan. Not Americans. QUESTION FROM OAKLAND: Ryan losing argument on sending more troops. QUESTION FROM COLUMBIA MBA STUDENT: Wow, That was it. “You want to send Ameicans to the most dangerous…” QUESTION FROM CHARLES: Obviously, Biden is stronger on Afghanistan policy. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Syria and Afghanistan ARE different, Biden is right about that. QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: Ryan is out of place with foreign policy… Why can’t he pivot? QUESTION FROM GUEST: Charles, hez’s stronger on all of it AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: really, you want another war in the Middle East? QUESTION FROM YOICHI HARIGUCHI: No contraception & abortion questions? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Justin, it’s an interesting question. In the Palin debate, when she realized she was out of her depth, she just changed the subject. AMY DAVIDSON: Yoichi, I hope that those are coming, too! RYAN LIZZA: If I remember correctly, after every VP debate there are a plethora of why-aren’t-these-guys-at-the-top-of-the-ticket stories. Will probably happen again. AMY DAVIDSON: Nick, Justin—I don’t think Ryan has a sense of his own weaknesses. QUESTION FROM PEGEMAK: i wish more american voters were watching this debate QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: ryan going to romney’s “russia’s our most dangerous enemy” QUESTION FROM PODGORNEY: @Ryan Lizza Well, maybe on the Democrat side. QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: Amy… That’s OBVIOUS… He needs to focus on the economy and end this topic ASAP… Its terrible and he just keeps going. QUESTION FROM GUEST: struggling to understand ryan here… listing groups that are not even in the region of syria…. RYAN LIZZA: I have never watched a debate where the gap between theory and practice was so stark. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Ryan is now blaming Biden for the fact that Russia is on the UN Security Council. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: Ryan keeps talking about us giving Russia veto power, that happened in 1945… QUESTION FROM MAZDAK: Ryan would better be quite about the middle east, he really shows his ignorance! QUESTION FROM KIERAN: If Assad doesn’t fall? Biden said he will. QUESTION FROM ALEXMCE: Wow, this Reuters photo. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Alexmce: hilarious. QUESTION FROM GUEST: If Ryan wants to show how he differs from Biden on actual practice, maybe he shouldn’t begin by highlighting their similarity on the minor point of chemical weapons QUESTION FROM K: Ryan talked a lot about what should have been done but has no idea about what should be done going forward. AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan just rejected humanitarianism as a reason for intervention, if I’m not mistaken. AMY DAVIDSON: Here we go: Raddatz—you’re both Catholic. Please talk personally about that and abortion. QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Religion—Great question . QUESTION FROM LOY: you are not mistaken, amy NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Raddatz has done a superb job. That was a classy way to ask the question. AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan: oppose abortion, both because of religion and because of epiphany seeing ultrasound. QUESTION FROM ANGELA: he’s pro-life because he nicknamed his child bean. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden talks about Catholic social doctrine. Accepts Church’s position “in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it.” QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: i refuse to impose that. beautiful. QUESTION FROM KEVIN: You can tell abortion is very real to Ryan. Can’t fall him for that. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Thank you Mr. Biden for standing up for a right to choose. QUESTION FROM KATHY: I wish someone would mention that valuing life also means to take care of children after they are born. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden points out that Ryan has not been ok in the past with rape victims getting access to abortion. QUESTION FROM ANGELA: bringing up ryan’s attempt to redefine rape as “forcible”! QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Thank you Kathy. QUESTION FROM PEGGY MACKEY: Thank you Mr. Biden from a devout Catholic QUESTION FROM NUPI32TLS: Not Ryan cannot be faulted for his beliefs, he can and should be faulted for using his political position to impose his beliefs on women. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden brings it home by reminding viewers that this is not just about what we think of each of their faiths, but about Supreme Court justices. QUESTION FROM PATRICIA ENCISO: Ryan—it shouldn’t be up to the court. They would bring a bill to the floor. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Ryan was good there. But Biden was better. He showed he can do both angry and emotional. RYAN LIZZA: That sounded like a litmus test. QUESTION FROM ERICP: “you have, on the issue of catholic social doctrine, taken issue with the Catholic church” AMY DAVIDSON: Telling that Ryan was presenting the “only rape, incest, life” exemption as a moderate position—compared to his past. QUESTION FROM DAVID KL: Final question already! This debate has been too much fun. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: perfect ending, 47% strikes again! QUESTION FROM RAMNATH: Great question on the negative campaign by both sides. But, Biden really hasn’t answered the question yet. QUESTION FROM GOODTIME CHARLIE: BEST VP DEBATE EVER! AMY DAVIDSON: Biden—who do you believe really cares about you? QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Biden not really closing it well, doesn’t address negativity. QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: ryan sounds like he’s going through mental bullet points without sincerity QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: he’s not answering the question AMY DAVIDSON: Did Ryan forget what the question was? He is repeating himself. AMY DAVIDSON: I’d guess that a lot of people are still reflecting on the abortion exchange, no? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Ryan has seemed a bit too much tonight like the guy in the Time pictures. QUESTION FROM JJ: attack blame defame? sounds like exactly what ryan is doing right now. QUESTION FROM GUEST: This might be Biden’s shining moment as VP thus far QUESTION FROM PATRICK: This question is just used as an “any additional comments gentlemen” QUESTION FROM DAVID KL: Last question about negativity turning negative: Irony QUESTION FROM JOHN: he is just cramming in points he was told to bring up—and ignoring the question QUESTION FROM GUEST: Irony comment FTW QUESTION FROM DAVID: If I was the decorated military individual listening to this response from Ryan, to a question asked on his behalf, i’d be disheartened. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: this is who you’ll hurt—children, students, the vulnerable. This is who you’d benefit: the wealthy QUESTION FROM GUEST: we just got 90 minutes of leadersship from joe AMY DAVIDSON: Raddatz: what would you give that no one else could? Ryan goes with “honesty”! QUESTION FROM DAVID KL: Good marathon times, Ryan? RYAN LIZZA: Ha! AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: My record stands for myself. My whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field. QUESTION FROM DAVEL: I think i heard Orwell’s ghost sigh QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Another great question from Martha! QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: what do YOU personally have to offer ryan, not vague waffle AMY DAVIDSON: We’re on the closing statements now. AMY DAVIDSON: Biden: closes with 47 %, then “let’s talk about my mother and father”—and neighbors—”all they’re looking for is an even shot” AMY DAVIDSON: Biden on parents reassuring children—moving. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: i love Biden’s husky voice, he sounds very emotional QUESTION FROM KEVIN: Joe has taken his tone down. Good move. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Biden with a big win here, Ryan didn’t slip up but Biden stepped up, better than Obama so far, where has this man been the last two years? QUESTION FROM MARK: excellent closing statement by biden QUESTION FROM ALEXMCE: Paul Ryan direct to camera reminds me of Me In High School Speech Competition AMY DAVIDSON: Ryan is not making any sort of emotional appeal in his closing. Sounds sarcastic. Not earned. QUESTION FROM PAT: Ryan’s memorized speech looks completely animatronic RYAN LIZZA: Biden’s facial expression right now suggests he does not necessarily agree with what Ryan is saying. QUESTION FROM ILLUMINATUS: I hate to say this, but Biden has been dominating this debate from the beginning. QUESTION FROM ALEX: Ryan closing statement reminds me of a commercial to invest in gold. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Alex, yes, exactly! AMY DAVIDSON: Pat, I agree. And Biden made it sound like he’d just decided to say on the spot. QUESTION FROM WATCHER IN NZ: ryan was shockingly bad QUESTION FROM JUSTIN: So they thought Obama would win and he lost… They thought Ryan would win and he lost… Interesting debate season QUESTION FROM IGOR GOLDKIND: Biden has come across as more credible in authority QUESTION FROM DEREK: Fantastic moderator = fantastic debate. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: BBC says it’s hard to call a winner, surely not, Biden all the way. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Thank you everyone. Lots of great comments and lots of fun. RYAN LIZZA: Thanks everyone! AMY DAVIDSON: Does anyone think there was a point Ryan carried? QUESTION FROM D.B. VALENTINE: Joe Biden killed it! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Final judgment: Biden won as convincingly as Romney did in the first one. QUESTION FROM ROB: Thank you QUESTION FROM JOHN: Biden: the relief washes over me in an awesome wave RYAN LIZZA: Agreed. QUESTION FROM DAVID KL: Did this game change Romney’s game change? AMY DAVIDSON: Wonderful comments from all our readers. Only sorry we couldn’t get to all of them! We have some time now, if people want to sum up. QUESTION FROM SARAH: I think biden won way more decisively than romney did QUESTION FROM JOHN: thanks to new yorker staff, enjoying your election coverage so far.. QUESTION FROM GREG: Guess who the guys on Fox think won? AMY DAVIDSON: Greg, who? QUESTION FROM PODGORNEY: Ted Olson’s in the audience. Gotta be disappointed. QUESTION FROM CHARLES: Ryan’s kid in the chair is classic! QUESTION FROM GAIL: Ryan looked unruffled, and strangely immovable…..smug. Biden stood up to everything extremely well. QUESTION FROM DAVID KL: Wish I tuned into The New Yorker earlier, this was a blast! QUESTION FROM DOUG: Will Biden’s win mean as much as Romney’s? AMY DAVIDSON: Doug, probably not. RYAN LIZZA: After Obama-Romney debate, almost all Repubs and half of Dems thought Romney won. I doubt half of Repubs will say Biden won this one. QUESTION FROM R: I only worry that post-debate “chatter” will focus too much on Biden’s laughter. QUESTION FROM GUEST: my favorite line: it’s about time they take some responsibility here QUESTION FROM JOHN LUCAS: Yes Amy, PR made a good point that to say when we are going to exit Afghanistan weakens our position. QUESTION FROM MATT: Thanks to everyone, my wife and I followed the discussion and loved it! QUESTION FROM SARAH: hopefully it will make next week’s debate more impactful—and make obama take a different tactic QUESTION FROM GUEST: As a Chinese, I’m wondering if vice president’s debate means so much AMY DAVIDSON: Am surprised to hear that the CNN commentators don’t clearly think Biden won. Or not yet. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Thank you Amy and Lizza. See you tomorrow. And let’s let Andy Borowitz have the final word: ***
Mr. Biden’s performance clearly wowed the Democratic voters in the post-debate poll, as ninety per cent of them “strongly agreed” with the statement, “Obama should crush a little bit of Joe Biden into a joint and smoke it.”
*** Full post here. AMY DAVIDSON: What? Gergen thinks that Ryan won? QUESTION FROM ALEX: Thanks everyone! Very enjoyable. QUESTION FROM MIKE: I like the push by Biden (and Raddatz) on Ryan for specifics and ‘the math’. Romney/Ryan are going to be in trouble if people keep asking them how their plans are actually supposed to work. AMY DAVIDSON: OK everyone, we’re going to move the discussion to Twitter. @newyorker is the one to follow. (Plus @ryanlizza, @nxthompson, @tnycloseread.) And thank you all for being here tonight! QUESTION FROM SAUL: Thank you for the commentary here, I enjoyed myself QUESTION FROM EVE: Tomorrow’s punditry will all be about how Biden was so much better than Obama.

Super-Rich Irony,31733,"One night last May, some twenty financiers and politicians met for dinner in the Tuscany private dining room at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. The eight-course meal included blinis with caviar; a fennel, grapefruit, and pomegranate salad; cocoa-encrusted beef tenderloin; and blue-cheese panna cotta. The richest man in the room was Leon Cooperman, a Bronx-born, sixty-nine-year-old billionaire. Cooperman is the founder of a hedge fund called Omega Advisors, but he has gained notice beyond Wall Street over the past year for his outspoken criticism of President Obama. Cooperman formalized his critique in a letter to the President late last year which was widely circulated in the business community; in an interview and in a speech, he has gone so far as to draw a parallel between Obama’s election and the rise of the Third Reich. The dinner was the highlight of the fourth annual SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as salt, a convention orchestrated by the fund manager Anthony Scaramucci; it brings together fund managers with brand-name speakers and journalists for four days of talking and partying. The star guest at the dinner was Al Gore, who was flanked by Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and the New York hedge-fund investor Orin Kramer, a friend of Gore’s and a top Obama fund-raiser. Discussion that night was wide-ranging. The group talked about Apple, on whose board Gore sits, and Google, where Gore is a senior adviser, as well as climate change and energy policy. The most electric moment of the evening, though, was an exchange between Cooperman and Gore. Heavyset, with a lumbering gait, Cooperman does not look like a hedge-fund plutocrat: Scaramucci affectionately describes him as “the worst-dressed billionaire on planet earth.” Cooperman’s business model isn’t flashy, either. He began his finance career as an analyst of consumer companies at Goldman Sachs, and went on to make his fortune at Omega as a traditional stock-picker. He searches for companies that are cheap and which he hopes to sell when they become dear. (In 1998, Cooperman made a foray into emerging markets, investing more than a hundred million dollars as part of a bid to take over Azerbaijan’s state oil company, but it went badly wrong. His firm lost most of its money and paid five hundred thousand dollars to settle a U.S.-government bribery investigation.) Cooperman had come to the dinner to give Gore a copy of the letter he’d written to President Obama. “I’d like you to read this,” he told the former Vice-President. “You owe me a small favor. I voted for you,” he said, referring to Gore’s Presidential run, in 2000. In the letter, Cooperman argued that Obama has needlessly antagonized the rich by making comments that are hostile to economic success. The prose, rife with compound metaphors and righteous indignation, is a good reflection of Cooperman’s table talk. “The divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them,” Cooperman wrote. “It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents.” At the dinner, Al Gore was diplomatic when presented with the letter, and asked Cooperman if he would accept higher taxes. Cooperman said that he would—if he was treated with respect, and the government didn’t squander his money. Cooperman asked Gore what he thought the top marginal tax rate should be. Gore’s reply was noncommittal, but he pleased the group by suggesting that no matter who wins in November the victor should surround himself with advisers with experience in the private sector. Kramer, the hedge-fund manager and Obama fund-raiser, was quiet, but others in the room were enthusiastic. Villaraigosa gave Cooperman his direct phone number. Barry Sternlicht, the founder of the W hotel chain, and an Obama donor in 2008, said that he agreed totally with Cooperman. Scaramucci, the organizer of the dinner, told me the next day that the guests had witnessed the “activation” of a “sleeper cell” of hedge-fund managers against Obama. “That’s what you see happening in the hedge-fund community, because they now have the power, because of Citizens United, to aggregate capital into political-action committees and to influence the debate,” he said. “The President has a philosophy of disdain toward wealth creation. That’s just obvious, O.K.? We talked about it all night.” He later said, “If there’s a pope of this movement, it’s Lee Cooperman.” The growing antagonism of the super-wealthy toward Obama can seem mystifying, since Obama has served the rich quite well. His Administration supported the seven-hundred-billion-dollar tarp rescue package for Wall Street, and resisted calls from the Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, and others on the left, to nationalize the big banks in exchange for that largesse. At the end of September, the S. & P. 500, the benchmark U.S. stock index, had rebounded to just 6.9 per cent below its all-time pre-crisis high, on October 9, 2007. The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have found that ninety-three per cent of the gains during the 2009-10 recovery went to the top one per cent of earners. Those seated around the table at dinner with Al Gore had done even better: the top 0.01 per cent captured thirty-seven per cent of the total recovery pie, with a rebound in their incomes of more than twenty per cent, which amounted to an additional $4.2 million each. Notwithstanding Occupy Wall Street’s focus on the “one per cent,” or Obama’s choice of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars as the level at which taxes on family income should rise, the salient dividing line between rich and not rich is much higher up the income-distribution scale. Hostility toward the President is particularly strident among the ultra-rich. This is the group that has benefitted most from the winner-take-all economy: the 0.1 per cent, whose share of the national income was 7.8 per cent in 2009, according to I.R.S. data. Moreover, even as the shifting tides of the global economy have rewarded the richest while squeezing the middle class, the U.S. tax system has favored the very top, as the tax returns of the Republican Presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, have illustrated. In 2011, Romney paid an effective tax rate of just 14.1 per cent, and his income of $13.7 million places him in the 0.01-per-cent group. When Obama first ran for President, four years ago, Wall Street formed an important and lucrative part of his base: he raised about sixteen million dollars from the financial sector, compared with McCain, who raised about nine million. Employees of Goldman Sachs contributed more to Obama’s campaign than workers at any other firm, on Wall Street or beyond. Like many others in the financial-services industry, Leon Cooperman was impressed when he first saw Obama in action, at a Goldman Sachs event at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York, in May, 2007. Goldman had assembled a group of hedge-fund managers to meet the junior senator from Illinois who had the temerity to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Cooperman said he was impressed by Obama’s reply to a question about what he would do to taxes on the rich if he were elected. “ ‘Raise ’em.’ Just like that. ‘Raise ’em,’ ” Cooperman recalled Obama saying. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" Although he voted for McCain in 2008, Cooperman was not compelled to enter the political debate until June, 2011, when he saw the President appear on TV during the debt-ceiling battle. Obama urged America’s “millionaires and billionaires” to pay their fair share, pointing out that they were doing well at a time when both the American middle class and the American federal treasury were under pressure. “If you are a wealthy C.E.O. or hedge-fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They are lower than they have been since the nineteen-fifties,” the President said. “You can still ride on your corporate jet. You’re just going to have to pay a little more.” Cooperman regarded the comments as a declaration of class warfare, and began to criticize Obama publicly. In September, at a CNBC conference in New York, he compared Hitler’s rise to power with Obama’s ascent to the Presidency, citing disaffected majorities in both countries who elected inexperienced leaders. A month before, Cooperman had written a mock, nine-point “Presidential platform,” outlining his political convictions, which he distributed to his investors. In it, he called for a freeze on entitlements, a jump in the retirement age to seventy for everyone except “those that work at hard labor,” and a temporary tax increase for the super-rich to help pay down the debt. He also called for significant spending cuts, so that the growth in government spending could be restricted to one per cent less than the increase in G.D.P. In November, he drafted the letter to the President. It was fifteen hundred words and took him two weeks to write. “I’m not a gifted writer,” Cooperman recalled. “I spent a lot of time using a dictionary and a thesaurus. I wanted to sound intelligent.” He got help from a friend, a former Omega employee. He also showed the letter to his wife, Toby. The letter begins by acknowledging that Obama inherited an “economic mess,” but what Cooperman seems to object to most is not the President’s policies but the “highly politicized idiom” in which the debate surrounding them was being conducted: You should endeavor to rise above the partisan fray and raise the level of discourse to one that is both more civil and more conciliatory.... Capitalism is not the source of our problems, as an economy or as a society, and capitalists are not the scourge that they are too often made out to be. As a group we employ many millions of taxpaying people, pay their salaries, provide them with healthcare coverage, start new companies, found new industries, create new products, fill store shelves at Christmas, and keep the wheels of commerce and progress (and indeed of government, by generating the income whose taxation funds it) moving. To frame the debate as one of rich-and-entitled versus poor-and-dispossessed is to both miss the point and further inflame an already incendiary environment. Evident throughout the letter is a sense of victimization prevalent among so many of America’s wealthiest people. In an extreme version of this, the rich feel that they have become the new, vilified underclass. T. J. Rodgers, a libertarian and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has taken to comparing Barack Obama’s treatment of the rich to the oppression of ethnic minorities—an approach, he says, that the President, as an African-American, should be particularly sensitive to. Clifford S. Asness, the founding partner of the hedge fund AQR Capital Management, wrote an open letter to the President in 2009, after Obama blamed “a small group of speculators” for Chrysler’s bankruptcy. Asness suggested that “hedge funds really need a community organizer,” and accused the White House of “bullying” the financial sector. Dan Loeb, a hedge-fund manager who supported Obama in 2008, has compared his Wall Street peers who still support the President to “battered wives.” “He really loves us and when he beats us, he doesn’t mean it; he just gets a little angry,” Loeb wrote in an e-mail in December, 2010, to a group of Wall Street financiers. The purported activation of the fund-manager “sleeper cell” is more than the self-aggrandizement of the super-rich. It is having a material and intellectual impact on the 2012 campaign. Historically, incumbent Presidents have enjoyed a strong fund-raising advantage. Going into this year’s race, President Obama had the further benefit of his record-breaking haul in 2008. Yet the Republican National Committee and Romney, a mechanical campaigner whose ability to inspire passion in the Republican base was widely questioned during the primaries, hold a huge cash advantage over Obama. The biggest shift has been among wealthy businesspeople, particularly in financial services. Romney’s advantage is compounded by the advent of Super pacs in this Presidential campaign, which are not subject to the same contribution limits as parties or candidates. The Republican-aligned Restore Our Future, for instance, has raised ninety-six million dollars this election season, and many of its top donors, who give a million dollars or more, work in finance. The President, in Cooperman’s view, draws political support from those who are dependent on government. Last October, in a question-and-answer session at a Thomson Reuters event, Cooperman said, “Our problem, frankly, is as long as the President remains anti-wealth, anti-business, anti-energy, anti-private-aviation, he will never get the business community behind him. The problem and the complication is the forty or fifty per cent of the country on the dole that support him.” Framing the political debate as job creators on one side and the President and the fifty per cent of Americans who are supported by the state on the other was striking at the time. It has become even more so since Mitt Romney was secretly recorded at a closed-door fund-raiser in Florida, in May, saying that forty-seven per cent of Americans don’t pay income taxes, are “dependent on the government,” and will vote for President Obama “no matter what.” Romney’s comment has been widely criticized as a mistake that could cost him the election, with even Republicans accusing their candidate of incompetence. Cooperman’s statement six months earlier shows that Romney’s forty-seven-per-cent remark wasn’t an undisciplined slip by a gaffe-prone politician but, instead, the assertion of a view that is widely held by people of Romney’s class. America’s super-rich feel aggrieved in part because they believe themselves to be fundamentally different from a leisured, hereditary gentry. In his letter, Cooperman detailed a Horatio Alger biography that has made him an avatar for the new super-rich. “While I have been richly rewarded by a life of hard work (and a great deal of luck), I was not to-the-manor-born,” he wrote, going on to describe his humble beginnings in the South Bronx, as the son of working-class parents—his father was a plumber—who had emigrated from Poland. Cooperman makes it known that he gets up at 5:20 a.m. and is at his desk at Omega’s offices in lower Manhattan, on the thirty-first floor of a building overlooking the East River and Brooklyn, by 6:40 a.m. He rarely gets home before 9 p.m., and most evenings he has a business dinner after leaving the office. “I say that I date my wife on the weekends,” he told me one August afternoon at his office. The space is defiantly modest, furnished with nineteen-nineties-era glass coffee tables, unfashionable yellow couches, and family photographs. Cooperman’s pride in his work ethic is one source of his disdain for Obama. “When he ran for President, he’d never worked a day in his life. Never held a job,” he said. Obama had, of course, worked—as a business researcher, a community organizer, a law professor, and an attorney at a law firm, not to mention an Illinois state legislator and a U.S. senator, before being elected President. But Cooperman was unimpressed. “He went into government service right out of Harvard,” he said. “He never made payroll. He’s never built anything.” Cooperman differs from many of his fellow super-rich in one important regard. He understands that he isn’t just smart and hardworking but that he has also been lucky. “I joined the right firm in the right industry,” he said. “I started an investment partnership at the right time.” In the fall of 1963, he enrolled in dental school at the University of Pennsylvania, but within the first week he began to have doubts, and he dropped out soon afterward. “My father, may he rest in peace, was going to work saying, ‘My son, the dentist,’ ” Cooperman said. “It was a total embarrassment amongst his friends.” Cooperman went on to make a series of fortunate choices. Chief among those was entering the financial markets, after graduating in 1967 from Columbia Business School. In the sixties, Wall Street wasn’t yet the obvious destination for the smart and ambitious, but it was on the verge of becoming the most lucrative industry in America. Cooperman became an analyst at Goldman Sachs, at the time a scrappy partnership that had nearly failed during the Great Depression. In 1976, Cooperman was named a partner. He went on to found Goldman’s asset-management business, but, after twenty-five years at the firm, he decided to start his own hedge fund. Between 1991, when Cooperman founded Omega, and the 2008 financial crisis was the best time in history to make a fortune in finance. Cooperman’s partners who stayed behind at Goldman Sachs are hardly paupers—and those who stuck around for the 1999 I.P.O. are probably multimillionaires—but the real windfalls on Wall Street have been made by the financiers who founded their own investment firms in the period that Cooperman did. Toby Cooperman grew up five miles away from her husband, in the west Bronx. She asked Cooperman out after they met in French class at Hunter College. Toby has two graduate degrees, in education and as a reading specialist, and works three days a week at a special-needs school in Chatham, New Jersey. “Growing up lower-middle-class Jewish in the Bronx, I never knew a Republican,” Toby Cooperman recalled. “Everybody loved Roosevelt.” She is still a liberal, a position that puts her in the minority in their social circle. “She can be a socialist because she’s married to a capitalist,” Cooperman says of his wife, who is strongly pro-choice and pro-gay marriage. She calls Todd Akin, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry “morons,” and she worries about the underclass. “I care more about the disadvantaged people of America,” she said, comparing her politics with those of her husband. “I have friends who are very dependent on Medicare.” Even so, Toby, who voted for Obama in 2008, defers to her husband when it comes to taxation, and she admires his letter to Obama. “He used a lot of good words,” she said. The New York Post published an abridged version of the letter, and Cooperman e-mailed it to some of his friends and colleagues. It quickly went viral. Within a couple of weeks, Cooperman was being courted by everyone from CNBC and Fox to Al Jazeera. “I would say, unequivocally, I never got as much response in anything I’ve ever done, in business or outside of business, that I got in that letter,” Cooperman said. Cooperman keeps a bulging manila folder of congratulatory notes in his office at Omega. He received “hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.” According to Cooperman, only one was nasty: “If I knew where you lived, I’d put a bomb in your car.” The folder includes a letter from a former chief of Goldman Sachs and another from a current boss of one of the nation’s top five banks. There are succinct letters of support from fellow Wall Street titans, typed on thick, embossed paper, and signed with a flourish, and long, angry screeds, which warn, as a ninety-two-year-old lawyer from Fort Worth, Texas, put it, that “Barack Obama is a Communist pure and simple, with a determined plan to convert America into a Communistic nation.” Like his wife, Cooperman doesn’t approve of the right’s blurring of the line between church and state, or its stance on gay marriage and abortion. Romney, he told me, has got to “appease the conservative wing of his party. But I don’t think he’s nuts like all those guys are.” Like other plutocrats, Cooperman presents his complaint not as a selfish defense of his pocketbook but as a concern about the degradation of the American dream. Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JP Morgan Chase, who was widely criticized this spring for the firm’s highly risky trade that has led to at least six billion dollars in losses, has echoed Cooperman’s view of the Obama Administration. Speaking on “Meet the Press” in May, Dimon said that he didn’t mind paying higher taxes and wanted “a more equitable society.” But the “anti-business behavior, the sentiment, the attacks on work ethic and successful people” by some Democrats had alienated Dimon so much that he said he would now call himself “a barely Democrat.” “It’s a question of tone,” Cooperman said. “The President makes it sound like the problems of the ninety-nine per cent are caused by the one per cent, and that’s not the case.” Yet some of the harshest language of this election cycle has come from the super-rich. Comparing Hitler and Obama, as Cooperman did last year at the CNBC conference, is something of a meme. In 2010, the private-equity billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, of the Blackstone Group, compared the President’s as yet unsuccessful effort to eliminate some of the preferential tax treatment his sector receives to Hitler’s invasion of Poland. After Cooperman made his Hitler comment, he has said, his wife called him a “schmuck.” But he couldn’t resist repeating the analogy when we spoke in May of this year. “You know, the largest and greatest country in the free world put a forty-seven-year-old guy that never worked a day in his life and made him in charge of the free world,” Cooperman said. “Not totally different from taking Adolf Hitler in Germany and making him in charge of Germany because people were economically dissatisfied. Now, Obama’s not Hitler. I don’t even mean to say anything like that. But it is a question that the dissatisfaction of the populace was so great that they were willing to take a chance on an untested individual.” It’s easy to see how even a resolutely unflashy billionaire like Cooperman can acquire a sense of entitlement. In a single hour at his desk one morning in April, the C.E.O.s of two well-known public companies were on the phone to Cooperman lobbying for his support. (He is a major investor in their firms.) Companies courting his investment dollars pick up Cooperman at Teterboro Airport in their private jets to give him a tour of their projects. The Coopermans have chosen an emphatically low-key life style, but when they went to visit a grandchild in Vermont one summer weekend they flew in a private plane. Last July, before he had written the letter, Cooperman was invited to the White House for a reception to honor wealthy philanthropists who had signed Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge, promising to donate at least fifty per cent of their net worth to charity. At the event, Cooperman handed the President two copies of “Inspired: My Life (So Far) in Poems,” a self-published book written by Courtney Cooperman, his fourteen-year-old granddaughter. Cooperman was surprised that the President didn’t send him a thank-you note or that Malia and Sasha Obama, for whom the books were intended as a gift and to whom Courtney wrote a separate letter, didn’t write to Courtney. (After Cooperman grumbled to a few friends, including Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, Michelle Obama did write. Booker, who was also a recipient of Courtney’s book, promptly wrote her “a very nice note,” Cooperman said.) When Cooperman told me the story of his lucky escape from dental school, he concluded, “I probably make more than a thousand dentists, summed up.” (A thousand dentists would need to work for a decade—and pay no taxes or living expenses—to collectively earn Cooperman’s net worth.) During another conversation, Cooperman mentioned that over the weekend an acquaintance had come by to get some friendly advice on managing his personal finances. He was a seventy-two-year-old world-renowned cardiologist; his wife was one of the country’s experts in women’s medicine. Together, they had a net worth of around ten million dollars. “It was shocking how tight he was going to be in retirement,” Cooperman said. “He needed four hundred thousand dollars a year to live on. He had a home in Florida, a home in New Jersey. He had certain habits he wanted to continue to pursue. “I’m just saying that it’s not an impressive amount of capital for two people that were leading physicians for their entire work life,” Cooperman went on. “You know, I lost more today than they spent a lifetime accumulating.” One billionaire who is not part of Cooperman’s “sleeper cell” is Warren Buffett. In 1982, Buffett sent Cooperman a note, praising one of the research reports he had written at Goldman Sachs. It hangs on Cooperman’s office wall. Cooperman clearly cherishes the opportunities that the Giving Pledge has given him to spend time with Buffett. He also admires Buffett’s life style, which is similar to his own. But Buffett’s embrace of the rule that bears his name—President Obama’s proposal that no millionaire should pay less than thirty per cent of his income in taxes—sets him apart from his peers. Cooperman pointed out that Buffett had adroitly minimized his personal taxes for many years until his late-life star turn as the President’s favorite billionaire. “I’m more charitable to him than most, because I have enormously high regard for him,” Cooperman said. “There are a lot of people who think he’s become extraordinarily hypocritical. . . . If he thinks it’s so wrong, people say, ‘Well, why doesn’t he just give his money to the government?’” Many billionaires have come to view charity as privatized taxation, paid at a level they determine, and to organizations they choose. “All things being equal, you’d rather have control of the money than the government,” Cooperman said. “Even if you’re giving it away, you’d rather give it away the way you want to give it away rather than the way the government gives it away.” Cooperman and his wife focus their giving on Jewish issues, education, and their local community in New Jersey, and he is also setting up a foundation that will allow his children and grandchildren to support their own chosen causes after he dies. Foster Friess, a retired mutual-fund investor from Wyoming who was the backer of the main Super pac supporting the Republican primary candidate Rick Santorum, expounded on this view in a video interview in February. “People don’t realize how wealthy people self-tax,” he said. “If you have a certain cause, an art museum or a symphony, and you want to support it, it would be nice if you had the choice.” The middle class anonymously and nervously pays its thirty-five per cent to the I.R.S., while the super-rich pay fourteen per cent, and are then praised for giving five or ten per cent more to pet causes, often with the perk of having their names engraved above the door. Cooperman repeatedly emphasizes his willingness in principle to pay higher taxes, though he sees nothing wrong with paying at the lowest possible rate the law allows. Although Toby still lives in New Jersey, Cooperman told me that he has moved for most of the year to Florida, “because I had arthritis, and I just needed the warmer weather.” He added, “Not to say there’s no benefit of a zero state income tax versus ten.” Nick Hanauer is a Seattle entrepreneur and venture capitalist who was one of the first investors in Amazon. In a book published this year, he argues that since the Reagan era American capitalists have enjoyed a uniquely supportive set of ideological, political, and economic conditions. Their personal enrichment came to be seen as a precondition for the enrichment of everyone else. Lower taxes for them were a social good, rather than a selfish perk. “If you are a job creator, your fifteen-per-cent tax rate is righteous. If you aren’t, it is a con job,” Hanauer told me. “The idea that the rich deserve to be rich is a very comforting idea if you are rich.” Referring to Obama’s “You didn’t build that” remark, at a rally in Virginia in July, which became a flashpoint with the right, Hanauer said that “the notion that you built it yourself is what you need to believe to feel comfortable with yourself and your desire not to pay too much in taxes.” I asked Cooperman whether Romney should disclose his tax returns. Beyond 2011 and 2010, he has not released any others. “Only a fool pays taxes that you don’t have to pay,” Cooperman said. “So what am I going to learn? He made a lot of money and he paid less taxes than the average person, but he did it from legal means. Does that make me think less of him? It’ll make me think more of him.” Cooperman observed that the smart reaction to Romney’s low effective tax rate would be to ask him for the name of his tax lawyer. Cooperman prides himself both on not being partisan and on his streetwise Bronx kid’s suspicion of politicians in general. But he’s genuinely enthusiastic about Romney. He approves of Romney’s commitment to his family and he admires Romney’s private-sector experience. “He’s an accomplished businessman,” Cooperman said. “The fact that he’s wealthy and successful I think is good, not bad.” Cooperman told me that he thought this was the most important election of his lifetime. In June, he made his biggest ever political contribution, when he wrote a fifty-thousand-dollar check supporting Mitt Romney’s Presidential bid after Romney’s brother, Scott, visited the Omega offices. Now Cooperman is planning another political volley. With his Omega partner Steven Einhorn and fellow-billionaire Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot, he has drafted a second open letter, which he hopes will be co-signed by a large group of self-made billionaires, and published as a newspaper advertisement in some swing states. Cooperman estimates that it will cost around a million dollars, a sum he says the group will split. “It’s going to be, you know, ‘We are the one per cent that came from the ninety-nine per cent, and we want to see more of the ninety-nine per cent move in our direction, but we fear the President’s policies discourage that from happening,’ ” Cooperman said. At the salt conference in Las Vegas, there was no shortage of wealthy financiers who shared Cooperman’s view. At a “Titans of Wall Street” panel, Barry Sternlicht, the W hotel-chain founder, appeared with Dan Loeb, the hedge-fund manager who compared Wall Street supporters of Obama to “battered wives,” and who has given three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to Republican Super pacs and thousands more to Republican candidates this campaign cycle. Their session was off the record, but attendees said that the two investors inveighed passionately against the President’s “anti-business” attitude. Another panelist suggested that Sternlicht and Loeb form a pro-business ticket and make a run for the White House. The audience cheered. On the final day, Cooperman delivered a presentation on his top stock picks. A few hours later, the conference concluded in the Bellagio’s grand ballroom, with the most billionaire-friendly speaker of all: Sarah Palin. She strode onto the stage and opened her talk with a rousing greeting, “Hello, one per cent! How y’all doing!” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

AMY DAVIDSON: Franforman, I wonder how long that will last. REBECCA MEAD: It feels so old-fashioned to be watching Jim Lehrer, doesn't it? Like the internet and cable TV never happened. QUESTION FROM GAIL: Love it QUESTION FROM PETE: Lehrer is laying down the rules! REBECCA MEAD: Love how they competed to be the first to grasp the other's arm NICK PAUMGARTEN: Obama with the double vents. QUESTION FROM DIANE: Lehrer came out of retirement to do this! QUESTION FROM TOMBAKER: very very double practiced hand shaking AMY DAVIDSON: Obama opening with the wedding anniversary. . . calls Michelle ""Sweetie"". . . it's their 20th QUESTION FROM TOMBAKER: both were told not to let go first QUESTION FROM GRANT: Married for 20 years, how cute--and that's creating jobs how? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Obama with some early framing: ""not where we've been. it's where we're going."" QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Off topic opening and then very boring general statements, not a good start for Barry Obama. NICK PAUMGARTEN: double down on the top down. NICK PAUMGARTEN: it caught him up. REBECCA MEAD: Mitt already got the first laugh of the night AMY DAVIDSON: Obama doesn't seem revved up. Romney does a better job with the anniversary reference. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: funnier joke from romney! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Yes, Mitt off to a good start. I always thought that his biggest problem in the GOP debates was a generally smug demeanor. But not seeing that at all here in the opener. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Better tone from Romney, more engaging. QUESTION FROM BB IN SAN DIEGO: Oooh he's going for the ""I can relate card early"" QUESTION FROM ELMO: Mitt tries to be human REBECCA MEAD: So much easier to be the guy saying that the current administration is getting it wrong, isn't it? AMY DAVIDSON: ""Trickle-down government"" could be an effective line. QUESTION FROM JAY: Gotta love the red state/blue state ties QUESTION FROM ANN MARIE: Romney's list is a good debate tactic--he seems organized and really present NICK PAUMGARTEN: Obama with the programs. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama says he wants to hire a hundred thousand teachers. Note, too, the emphasis on community colleges. QUESTION FROM GUEST: ""Please respond directly""... ""Let me respond generally, first."" QUESTION FROM BB IN SAN DIEGO: I'd rather here these guys go after each other than hear their respective stump speeches for the trillionth time REBECCA MEAD: Obama's twice pointed out where he and Romney agree. Trying to make the case that Romney is closer to him than Romney would like to admit. NICK PAUMGARTEN: I agree, BB. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: BB: I think you'll get that! NICK PAUMGARTEN: Put on the foil. QUESTION FROM BB IN SAN DIEGO: playing it wayyyyy to safe, Mitt has to go after Obama NICK PAUMGARTEN: Well, I'd say the low income people are having a pretty hard time too. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: I don't have a tax cut as big as Obama says; I have tax relief. And don't worry about higher income people getting it all. QUESTION FROM SEAN: Romney taking the first offense. QUESTION FROM DAN: They gave mitt the first offense NICK PAUMGARTEN: Mitt: I like coal. AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt will ""bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal"" QUESTION FROM MAULBEARS: i coal too, mitt. QUESTION FROM TOM(AUSTRALIA): clean coal? QUESTION FROM CHRISTINE: So when it's your turn at the podium, just say what you want. Wasn't he supposed to be asking a question? NICK PAUMGARTEN: in a stocking. at christmas. REBECCA MEAD: Obama being professorial. (I like professors.) NICK PAUMGARTEN: Obama playing small ball. REBECCA MEAD: Mitt breaking the no-silence rule and trying to interrupt... NICK PAUMGARTEN: Lehrer: zp, bp, hp REBECCA MEAD: I mean no-talking rule, obviously AMY DAVIDSON: Obama takes a while, but getting to the point that Romney's math doesn't work. QUESTION FROM PAM: The change in mitt's rhetoric from the convention is head spinning -- no? NICK PAUMGARTEN: I thought that was Lehrer. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Obama now on a little roll. His ""Romney's been asked 100 times"" and hasn't answered is effective. QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: too many details, get to the one-liners and zingers... and throw in some gotcha questions! AMY DAVIDSON: Romney silences Lehrer, says Obama is not being accurate. And then that no economist can say that his plan adds to the deficit--because he says it won't. So there. NICK PAUMGARTEN: good line, about the five boys. QUESTION FROM LUCIA: Obama appears to be doing the math. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Don't interrupt Jim, it looks rude! AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: why lower the rates on the wealthy? To help the small-business guy! QUESTION FROM AST: Whoa, anyone else surprised by Romney's confidence tonight? AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: ""It's math. It's arithmetic""--quoting Clinton there. REBECCA MEAD: Again, Obama pointing out what they have in common. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: So far, Obama has made a more persuasive case that he can cut taxes. And Romney has made a more persuasive case that he cares for the middle class. Who's the D and who's the R? AMY DAVIDSON: Obama will succeed if he can make the bad math point very, very clear. Almost there but not quite. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: ""Donald Trump is a small business"" Let's see if Romney picks up on the Donald theme. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Amy, agreed. He needs a bit more of Clinton there. QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): Obama is not sounding as clear as he needs to. QUESTION FROM CHRISTINE: Jim seems to be losing control of this debate......... NICK PAUMGARTEN: Obama looks a little rattled to me. REBECCA MEAD: He does, Nick. None of his funny lines are landing. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: I know an electrician with four employees, and Obama would raise his taxes. QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: He is Rattled. No doubt. Came out nervous, talking too fast.... If Romney had a little Newt in him, it'd be over... QUESTION FROM C-RAE: Romney is just rattling off statistics QUESTION FROM TESSA: Good thing he doesn't have any Newt in him AMY DAVIDSON: Obama trying again on the math. QUESTION FROM DAVID: He seems to recycle is lines hopes it gets better for him NICK PAUMGARTEN: Math, common sense undermined by a double negative. REBECCA MEAD: Yes, Nick, and him such a good writer, too! AMY DAVIDSON: True, Nick. Do people think that Obama watched Clinton's convention speech too closely? Not everyone can duplicate. QUESTION FROM SEAN: Is Obama running or Clinton? QUESTION FROM CRENSHAW: body language: Obama looks like a Deadhead. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney doesn't much care what Lehrer wants. Also: ""My plan is not like anything that has been tried before"" QUESTION FROM AST: Romney wants the last word, and Obama wants to move on. Interesting. QUESTION FROM JENNIFER SPO: So much for having a moderator! NICK PAUMGARTEN: Amy, maybe you should moderate this debate and Jim can come here and hang out with us. QUESTION FROM JON: Jim L. does not have control of this... QUESTION FROM TESSA: I believe the Obama-Clinton comparison keeps coming up due to the economic stand still then and now QUESTION FROM MAURICE: why hasn't the 47% been mentioned at all? AMY DAVIDSON: Much easier here! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: at the moment. QUESTION FROM MATT: has ""business"" become a euphemism at this point in the campaign season? QUESTION FROM PAM: Mitt has been being well rehearsed in debate camp. Obama has been being president. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Big Bird! AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: ""I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS"" even though ""I like Big Bird"" QUESTION FROM BP: Mitt wants to fire the moderator ! NICK PAUMGARTEN: Prefers coal to Big Bird. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama start by talking about how hard it was when he came in. I'm not sure that's where he should be right now. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Big bird covered in oil spill. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Big Oil, Big Wind, Big Big Bird. QUESTION FROM TESSA: I'm guessing that was him relating to the 47% QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: I like coal, I love big bird. two zingers! now we're talking! GO MITT AMY DAVIDSON: Obama wants the rich to do ""just a little bit more."" Much of what he's said has been about the little. QUESTION FROM JAMIE: I think Obama may have lost a few people here NICK PAUMGARTEN: OK, Mr. President, if you like Bowles-Simpson so much... QUESTION FROM JACKIE: Big Bird is just the right height. AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: the President ""should have grabbed"" Simpson Bowles. But not me! ""I have my own plan."" QUESTION FROM PATRICK: The President shouldn't apologize. Looks weak. QUESTION FROM TESSA: Mitt is avoiding the question. QUESTION FROM MATT: I like being able to fire big bird. QUESTION FROM BOB: I have no idea what Mitt's plan is! AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: ""It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing."" Will Trump become a theme here? Guesses on more mentions? AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: I have ""absolutely"" ruled out raising revenues to address deficit, because ""you'll never get there."" Big Bird, on the other hand... NICK PAUMGARTEN: Mitt: You never balance the budget by raising taxes. And cites Spain. QUESTION FROM MERT: I'm not sure whether Romney knows his plan or not. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: All Trump references work for Obama. They remind me both of his crazy dalliance with the GOP, and the White House Correspondents dinner where Obama laid into him. . . the night before the OBL raid. QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): Hey, leave Spain alone, Mitt. REBECCA MEAD: Disappointingly, Trump is not live-tweeting NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Obama takes on Exxon-Mobil! (Read Steve Coll for more on this) AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: ""Does anyone think Exxon Mobil needs money?"" But when he says, ""why wouldn't anyone want to eliminate that,"" I wonder if the ""that"" will become the object of speculation. . . as if he want to get rid of oil companies. QUESTION FROM NICK L: Who brings up Tebow first? QUESTION FROM JANET: Oooh, Zinger -of course Exxon Mobil doesn't need tax cut!!! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Nick L --- I think the replacement refs come up first. (Is Lehrer going to be compared to one?) AMY DAVIDSON: Obama picking up speed. ""budgets reflect choices"". . . he matches Romney's electrician with a teacher in Vegas. QUESTION FROM TESSA: There we go! Talk about the Education system! Thank You on behalf of my third grade class! REBECCA MEAD: I wish Amy Davidson could replace JIm Lehrer. NICK PAUMGARTEN: There's the Obama smile. AMY DAVIDSON: How about Big Bird as moderator? Or Oscar the Grouch. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: I wonder if Obama's debate performance will be like his convention speak. Very, very slow at the beginning. . . but then gradually gaining steam. QUESTION FROM GAIL: Mr. Rogers QUESTION FROM NICK L: The Count would be the better timekeeper REBECCA MEAD: Could Obama please bring up Mitt's own taxes, even if only obliquely? NICK PAUMGARTEN: Mitt: You pick the losers. And Obama smiles again. Weird. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: ""I maybe need to get a new accountant"". . . did I hear that right? QUESTION FROM ZOE: Uhoh I think Bain Capital is about to be brought up NICHOLAS THOMPSON: THere's opportunity for Obama there to respond to Romney's ""got to get a new accountant"". ""If you're payng 13%, your accountant is pretty good"" REBECCA MEAD: Nice, Nick T. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Yes, Nick. Nick to Obama's ear. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney--states say please, ""we can care for our own poor"". . . the poor not an part of ""We""? QUESTION FROM TESSA: VERY nice Nick! QUESTION FROM TESSA: I really want Obama to bring up the 47% and the tax issue QUESTION FROM ALICIA, MAINE: Obama, nods calmly when not speaking; Mitt, silent fits. AMY DAVIDSON: What? Why is Obama saying that he and Romney have a similar position on Social Security? NICK PAUMGARTEN: Obama: More similarities. More small ball. QUESTION FROM GAIL: Obama is taking too high a road QUESTION FROM GREG: Is Mitt doing well, or is Obama doing poorly? AMY DAVIDSON: Funny how it's Obama who's owning having a relative who worked in the financial industry. QUESTION FROM PATRICK: The President is resorting to anecdotes from ""Dreams From My Father""...we all could have read it 6 years ago... NICK PAUMGARTEN: ""For younger people we need to talk about changes that are occurring. We'll be firing Big Bird."" AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: if you are sixty or older, ""you don't have to listen any further."" Except, he says, Colombo-style, that he just remembered Obama would be robbing Medicare. QUESTION FROM MAURICE: wait did he just say 60 and over don't listen? AMY DAVIDSON: If Obama can't answer the $716 billion effectively, he will have done badly. And so far he's not. REBECCA MEAD: Mitt just said that he didn't need to listen to himself. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: There was a lot of talk before the debate that Romney had to win the first 30 minutes. Seems pretty to clear that he has done so. He's talking to Obama with energy; Obama is talking to Lehrer, but lacking passion. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: ""If you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen."" Actually, any age might be interested, no? And he has not dealt with the robbing-Medicare charge. NICK PAUMGARTEN: In answer to the question of whether it is Romney doing well or Obama doing poorly, I'd answer, ""Both."" QUESTION FROM MAURICE: Obama's too cool for school vibe is not serving him well tonight, uhg! QUESTION FROM TOM BAKER: Obama is answering as if he is being asked questions on The View AMY DAVIDSON: I agree, Nick. QUESTION FROM CHRIS B.: Future people, people from the future? This has an effect on people of any age group. Or time period. QUESTION FROM PHOEBE: It'd be nice if either candidate could get the questions answered... QUESTION FROM ROB: Mitt is a good presenter, but why do I constantly feel like there are several 'plans', but not a clear vision? AMY DAVIDSON: Rob, or a vague vision but no plan at all. QUESTION FROM ANDR. . .Â©: I'm Canadian; watching this on CBC news. They're showing polls that indicate that 71% of those voting believe Obama is winning. 22% Romney. REBECCA MEAD: Romney: ""I'd rather have a private plan."" Because he's always had private everything. AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: I'd like a private insurance plan: ""If I don't like them I can get rid of them."" Is ""get rid of"" gentler than fired? He also brings up the 716 billion again. QUESTION FROM SEAN: Appealing to business background here. Nice, mitt. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Private plan, private plane. QUESTION FROM LARRY PRESS: Romney seems to think Medicare dictates where you get medical treatment. QUESTION FROM PETER: He keeps bringing it up and Obama keeps letting it slide. QUESTION FROM JON: Almost no direct interaction... REBECCA MEAD: Private school, private equity... QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): Spain press is angry with Romney's reference to its failure. QUESTION FROM BB IN SAN DIEGO: Obama may win Florida right here and now NICHOLAS THOMPSON: So Obama is winning Spain and Canada. But losing in USA QUESTION FROM MATT: President Obama has had two AARP shout-outs so far, interesting QUESTION FROM KB: Romney will not play by the rules. QUESTION FROM STEVE: I can't get the image of Big Bird on seling apples outside PBS HQ out of my mnd AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: ""every free economy has good regulation."" Says he needed to be regulated. QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): Offtopic: @BigBirdRomney @FiredBigBird @SadBigBird Twitter accounts have been created. That was fast. QUESTION FROM GENE: Anyone else is getting annoyed with Mitt constantly interrupting? AMY DAVIDSON: Lehrer: ""Let's not"" NICK PAUMGARTEN: Yes, Gene. Even Lehrer. QUESTION FROM GAIL: Obama's smile is good, guys QUESTION FROM PETER: lehrer for the win NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Gene. . . good question. One Democratic strategist told Politico that one of Obama's biggest goals was to not appear to be ""a bigger dick"" than Mitt. REBECCA MEAD: Obama's warming up. NICK PAUMGARTEN: A ""dick-off""? QUESTION FROM ALEX: Now we're talking. QUESTION FROM BRIAN: Lehrer's sly smile when Romney kept interrupting is reason enough to keep funding PBS. NICK PAUMGARTEN: No, that's not the facts, that's an informed opinion. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Now Obama is on the offensive. Romney can't win here on regulation of Wall Street. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: ""Does anyone think that the big problem we had was that there was too much oversight of Wall Street""? REBECCA MEAD: Obama's ironical ""if you think that, vote for Romney,"" seems too oblique. AMY DAVIDSON: Did Romney just go from talking about Wall Street's regulation to his own experience of being regulated? He is now sounding like he's talking to other bankers. QUESTION FROM KIERAN: What would Romney have proposed in lieu of bail outs? Let them fail? QUESTION FROM BOB: I don't know what a qualified mortgage is! QUESTION FROM GAIL: so hard for poor Romney to get a mortgage these days QUESTION FROM KIERAN: Romney doesn't come off well talking about looking after markets REBECCA MEAD: ""expensive things hurt families."" Getting sick when you're uninsured is plenty expensive. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: What was that eye roll? AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: he says that insurance costs a lot for families; then that Obamacare costs a lot. Connection? QUESTION FROM CC: Romney tees it up, Obama needs to knock it off NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Amy: yes, it's weird, but possibly effective. Medical care is messed up, and it's Obamacare's fault! (even though it hasn't mainly gone into effect) REBECCA MEAD: This is Obama's opportunity to point out how close Romney's state plan was to his plan. QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): That was good: ""@BorowitzReport Romney: ""Obamacare is by far the worst idea I ever had."" QUESTION FROM ZT: First debate I'm watching (I'm a student from Italy). So organized and polite here, so far. Love you America NICK PAUMGARTEN: Too organized, too polite, maybe? AMY DAVIDSON: Romney talks about health insurance as one of many products a family is shopping for, not as a life-defining thing. QUESTION FROM ZOE: I wish the debates were a little less polite. I feel like points are being lost in the gratitude. NICK PAUMGARTEN: we could do with a little Question Time. QUESTION FROM DAN MCCARTHY: Should have made his Obamacare talking points cleaner, two sentences, that's it AMY DAVIDSON: Obama stays on, and talks about Romneycare. AMY DAVIDSON: He also did a decent job on explaining how insurance companies were limited by Obamacare. AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: ""I liked what we did in Massachusetts"". . . but talks mostly about liking the process, rather than being proud of the product. Also, I think this is the fourth time he's mentioned the $716 billion, without Obama effectively answering. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Bain man cites McKinsey. QUESTION FROM JAMIE: Romney is lucky he caught himself about ""Massachusetts Medicare"" AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: Hmm, people keep telling me that my plan is the same as Romney's. Also, I don't have death boards. QUESTION FROM TESSA: Mitt keeps opening the door and I'm waiting for Obama to kick it wide open QUESTION FROM ARI: Obama finally equated Obamacare with Romneycare. Finally landing some blows. NICK PAUMGARTEN: There are many more than two ways to deal with our health care crisis. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama, looking around the nation for an example of a healthcare provider, happens upon a clinic in Cleveland, Ohio... QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: He doesn't need to defend health care -- it was Romney's too. QUESTION FROM NL: How is the winner determined? Are there a bunch of undecided voters hooked up to a machine? AMY DAVIDSON: NL, ultimately on Election Day. We won't really know who won until then. QUESTION FROM NEW ZEALAND WATCHER: why are americans always 'folks'?? QUESTION FROM TED: It's decided by judges like a boxing/mma match. NICK PAUMGARTEN: And sometimes not even then. QUESTION FROM TESSA: If you watch it on CNN, yet it is a bunch of undecided voters hooked up to a machine AMY DAVIDSON: Obama: Fifty million people will lose health insurance under Romney. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: young people can stay on parent's insurance on my plan. . . because the marketplace offers such plans? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: The key for Obama in this debate is to throw Romney off balance at some point. Mitt's great at running through planned bullet points. Hasn't happened much. QUESTION FROM JACKIE: The Cleveland Clinic is one of the highest ranking hospital systems in the country FYI AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt also seems familiar with the Cleveland Clinic. Now talking about how he used to be a hospital consultant. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Yes, Nick T. Instead, Obama is on the defensive. QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: Businesses...excuse me...hospitals NICK PAUMGARTEN: Hello, Cleveland! QUESTION FROM MIKETROSE: ""Government never makes anything less expensive"" You mean, other than Medicare. QUESTION FROM SERAJ: Wait is he trying to resurrect the ""death panels"" argument? Really? QUESTION FROM LINDSAY: Cleveland > Trump NICK PAUMGARTEN: I'm told that Obama's getting hit pretty hard on inTrade. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama, on Mitt's claim that he covers pre-existing conditions: your plan just copies the current law; you can only keep your insurance if there's no more than a 90-day gap. This is not the same as requiring insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions who are not already insured. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: yes, has dropped from 68 to 65% over the last few minutes. AMY DAVIDSON: But I'm not sure either he (or I) was clear about that. QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: Best way to tell who won, check the odds in Vegas. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL: What's inTrade? AMY DAVIDSON: Obama edged toward ""secret plan,"" but didn't nail it. NICK PAUMGARTEN: inTrade's a prediction market. Crowd-sourcing. QUESTION FROM GUEST: HMOs dictate treatment already QUESTION FROM ALISSA: When are we going to hear about the 47%? NICK PAUMGARTEN: Now, I think. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney's mention of the Tenth Amendment. . . powers not explicitly given to federal govt reserved to the state. . . is second only to the second amendment as a shout-out to a certain segment of the GOP. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL: Only 15min left. Wow. AMY DAVIDSON: Obama reeling around to where he start: a hundred thousand math and science teachers. QUESTION FROM BRIAN: ""Let's make these last 15 minutes count, guys!"" - Jim Lehrer, 2012 QUESTION FROM MAX: It's scary how vague the current President is being about his own policies. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Mitt: ""I love great schools."" Yup. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney: I do so like teachers. Also, I like the Declaration of Independence. REBECCA MEAD: Obama blew that role of government question. That was his opportunity to go 47%-wards, and he didn't. AMY DAVIDSON: Romney also brings up ""our creator."" AMY DAVIDSON: Rebecca, you are absolutely correct. QUESTION FROM GAIL: Mitt: I can pursue my happiness NICHOLAS THOMPSON: +1 Rebecca AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: You may say I'm a dreamer... NICK PAUMGARTEN: Yes, my one-man prediction market was certain we were getting the 47 back there. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Plus for Romney: way better prepared, more passion, much clearer. Cons for Romney: still seems a bit unlikeable, more likely to get hit by fact-checkers tomorrow AMY DAVIDSON: It is interesting that Mitt thought of social programs in terms of the pursuit of happiness: charity makes us glad? Not the same as obligation or investment. REBECCA MEAD: Why can't Mitt say ""poor kids""? Is that a slur now? QUESTION FROM BJ: Mitt is on his game QUESTION FROM BRIAN: Whoops. Poor Romney. Lower income Romney, rather. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Lower Income Richard's Almanac AMY DAVIDSON: Romney did seem worried about using the word ""poor."" But he also said that school choice helped disabled children. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Not passion from Romney, but histrionics QUESTION FROM MIKETROSE: From Neil DeGrasse Tyson, via Twitter: neiltyson: Cutting PBS support (0.012% of budget) to help balance the Federal budget is like deleting text files to make room on your 500Gig hard drive QUESTION FROM ALICIA, MAINE: Obama's usually charismatic hesitations coming off as trying to formulate sentences. . . . . . REBECCA MEAD: Nice, MikeTRose QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: How exactly would Romney funnel that money to the children? QUESTION FROM GEORG: The mittster is unbearably smug throughout this debate, like someone who seems to think he has already won the election. Obama has the air of being extremely tired, and a little depressed (also the way he is struggling for words). (I cannot really put it into words why, but watching this makes me despair a little about the Obama campaign.) NICK PAUMGARTEN: Maybe Big Bird is a pinata full of money. AMY DAVIDSON: Student loans are an opportunity for Obama. Let's see how he does with it, though. QUESTION FROM STEPHANIE: who sparred with O in preparation? fired. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Was all of the talk by the Romney campaign about zingers a feint? Getting Obama to prepare to respond to that and not an onslaught of facts? AMY DAVIDSON: Stephanie, it was John Kerry. QUESTION FROM KAILY: Obama seems tired? He's the President. He has other things going on besides just preparing for debate. He has a JOB. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Do we think they come into this intending to talk in great detail about programs? QUESTION FROM JOEY: When Romney insisted he has no plan to cut education I was waiting for Obama to yell ""you have no plan!"" AMY DAVIDSON: Joey, could point. AMY DAVIDSON: Jim Lehrer says he's not going to grade them, or himself. REBECCA MEAD: How bad is Jim Lehrer feeling right now? AMY DAVIDSON: There is a lot of fact-checking work to do here. QUESTION FROM KEN: How odd is it to care about education when you want to fire Big Bird? REBECCA MEAD: He wants to grade Big Bird, then fire him. AMY DAVIDSON: Is anyone else struck by how little there was in this debate about either man's background or biography? QUESTION FROM @ESLEYISLE: Oh just switch to foreign issues in your closing argument :/ QUESTION FROM CHRISTINE: Why is the question about partisan gridlock the last question in the debate with no time to respond? QUESTION FROM TOM BAKER: Obama characterizes Romney as the President AMY DAVIDSON: Tom, I was struck by that, too. Why is Obama imagining Romney's first day on the job? NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Amy, I thought it was funny! QUESTION FROM JEANNE: my son got his voter registration card. for whom will he vote? QUESTION FROM DG: What about judicial appointments (i.e. social issues). Are they saving that for future debates? QUESTION FROM JED: 6 topics, not one on education, race, immigration, poverty, crime, cities, the environment. mostly just arguing about statistics QUESTION FROM MAURICE: were my expectations for Obama too high? AMY DAVIDSON: On the other hand, Obama no longer looks or is young. He is pointing that out now. QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: How is Obama ahead 8 points? Did we watch the same debate? NICK PAUMGARTEN: What is this, Canada? AMY DAVIDSON: The poll you are seeing is of our New Yorker chatters! AMY DAVIDSON: All of you, that is, not me & Nick & Nick & Rebecca. QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: Blame Canada, Blame Canada! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Nick. . . it's Spain. QUESTION FROM JEJO: barthelme, self selecting group here at nyorker. QUESTION FROM GREG: I'm voting Obama, but I don't see how anyone can say he won that debate. AMY DAVIDSON: Mitt: I will replace a plan with principles. This will bring the cost of health care down, because the states will figure out. And a fifth time with the $716 billion! Which is not what he says it is. . . but you wouldn't know from Obama, QUESTION FROM VIKRAM: Wow, Obama didn't go for the kill once. Came across so patrician. QUESTION FROM MATT: although a lot's been made about Romney being non-ideological, his level of comfort tonight reminds me of the PowerPoint leitmotif in Nicholas Lemann's recent profile. If Mitt believes in any transcendence, it's of the sort embodied in a well-organized business pitch. Obama's too intellectual to believe in the well-turned Fact as Mitt Gradgrind, and that's why Obama lost tonight. (Also he looked like he might have gas.) REBECCA MEAD: Andrew Sullivan just said Obama may have lost election tonight. QUESTION FROM GUEST: If this poll was on Fox it would be slightly differant NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Gold to Romney; Silver to Obama; Bronze to Lehrer. QUESTION FROM SEAN: Obama failed to hit the three big talking points: $716 Billion, 47%, and lack of concrete details. QUESTION FROM TESSA: Sasha and Malia not there? QUESTION FROM TOM BAKER: Michelle's face was very worried NICK PAUMGARTEN: I would not subject children to this. QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: Romney came across as a shark, Obama as stuttering chum. It's scary. NICK PAUMGARTEN: The race is on. AMY DAVIDSON: Thank you all for being there! We can keep chatting for a few minutes, to process this. And Nick--I agree. REBECCA MEAD: Obama looked sad (depressed, as one commenter said), and tired. Too wordy. Many times I thought he was going to land a blow, and he let his fist drop. QUESTION FROM ADAM: Obama is winning the vote here but he lost this debate...the vote that is women, Hispanic and black is reflected here... and it will be reflected in the general election vote also QUESTION FROM MAX: Michelle knows that was a bad debate. NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Thank you Amy, Nick, and Rebecca. See you tomorrow! NICHOLAS THOMPSON: And thank you everyone for all of the great comments and feedback. NICK PAUMGARTEN: Good night, all. AMY DAVIDSON: It is not simply that Obama didn't attack; he didn't defend himself. . . or Obamacare. I know I've mentioned it a few times, but not addressing the $716 billion robbery was a real lapse. QUESTION FROM TYLER: im canadian but i think romney had a better debate by far AMY DAVIDSON: Goodnight, Nick and Nick! And thank you! QUESTION FROM MATT: How much can fact checkers reframe this one? Is there hope that Romney takes a hit for all the platitudes? QUESTION FROM ALBERT (BARCELONA): Thank you! Time to sleep here in Spain. :) REBECCA MEAD: Good night, folks. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL: Thanks. QUESTION FROM JEJO: O looked pretty dejected walking off stage, too (unless i am projecting) QUESTION FROM TROY: It's a school night. AMY DAVIDSON: So sorry that we didn't have time to get everyone's comments in! But we will do this again for the other debates. Please join us again! QUESTION FROM LARRY ZONGERFIELD: Bye! QUESTION FROM VICKY: This was great. Thank you. QUESTION FROM RAMNATH: Thanks, nice debate, great comments! QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: Dejection's in America's air tonight QUESTION FROM BARTHELME: great time. thanks! AMY DAVIDSON: Thank you all, and good night! We'll continue this conversation on Twitter--follow @newyorker

Ferguson vs. Krugman: Where Are the Real Conservative Intellectuals?,9370,"There’s nothing like a scrap between two seasoned brawlers to liven up a Monday in the dog days of August. In the red corner, Niall Campbell Douglas Ferguson, Laurence A. Tisch professor of history at Harvard and conservative bomb-thrower in residence at the Daily Beast/Newsweek. In the blue corner, Paul Robin Krugman, Nobel-winning economist, Princeton prof, and designated liberal curmudgeon at the Times. As fans of political sparring will recall, these two have mixed it up before—numerous times, in fact, mainly over the Obama stimulus. The cause of their latest spat: a characteristically overstated Newsweek cover story by Ferguson arguing that it’s time to replace Obama. (Headline: “Hit the Road Barack: Why We Need a New President.”) Krugman, who has been spending the last few weeks hiking through some pretty-looking hills, interrupted his vacation to accuse his old nemesis of misrepresenting the facts in claiming that Obamacare will add more than a trillion dollars to the deficit over the next ten years. Nothing very surprising there, you might say. Ferguson, a prolific author whose “end is nigh” worldview makes him a popular speaker on the hedge-fund/Davos circuit, has been railing away at the Obama Administration since 2009, warning that its profligate spending policies were sending the U.S.A. the way of Greece. The equally indefatigable Krugman has been lecturing Ferguson for almost as long about his ignorance of elementary (Keynesian) economics and the bond market. (If people in the markets truly believed Ferguson’s analysis, the U.S. government would never be able to issue ten-year bonds with a yield of well under two per cent.) What is pretty remarkable about the latest dustup is the weakness of the arguments presented by Ferguson, a streetwise public intellectual who, according to his Web site, now holds positions at four different élite academic institutions. If called upon three months before an election to pen a provocative cover story in a national newsmagazine clamoring for the President to be chucked out, most writers would make every effort to avoid giving the other side easy opportunities to tear down their arguments. And yet, here comes Ferguson blatantly twisting a report from the Congressional Budget Office and presenting numerous other distortions and half-truths that anybody with access to Google could discredit in a few hours. It all got me pondering anew a question that’s been been on my mind every day since Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate: Where are the real conservative intellectuals these days? Surely there must be some, but sometimes it seems like all the right has to offer is a soap-box mountebank like Ryan, a trio of embittered Supreme Court Justices, and a few gnarled old Washington fixtures like Bill Kristol, George Will, and Charles Krauthammer. Given this vacuum, it’s relatively easy for an energetic and disputatious blow-in like Ferguson to emerge as one of Obama’s most visible, if not exactly persuasive, critics. The immediate bone of contention is the fiscal impact of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. On this, I have some sympathy for Ferguson’s argument that it is likely to be substantial. Providing tens of millions of uninsured Americans hefty subsidies to buy private insurance will surely be an expensive business. The history of other entitlement programs, such as Medicare, suggests initial cost estimates often prove overoptimistic, and that could well prove to be true here. But rather than making this argument, Ferguson took another tack, implying that the official actuaries had already said the reforms would add substantially to the deficit. He wrote, The president pledged that health-care reform would not add a cent to the deficit. But the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation now estimate that the insurance-coverage provisions of the ACA will have a net cost of close to $1.2 trillion over the 2012-22 period. Actually, that’s true as far as it goes. But it doesn’t go nearly far enough. In addition to providing subsidies for the uninsured, the A.C.A. included tax increases on premium insurance plans, the imposition of certain user fees, and significant cuts in Medicare spending. As Krugman rightly pointed out, when the scorers from the C.B.O./Joint Committee took these changes into account, they concluded that the A.C.A. would actually reduce the deficit slightly rather than adding to it. You don’t have to look very hard at the C.B.O./Joint Committee report (pdf) to see the relevant numbers. They are right there in Table 1 on page 2: over the period from 2012 to 2022, the A.C.A. would reduce the deficit by $210 billion. Ferguson omitted any mention of this figure. Upon being challenged, he posted a rebuttal on the Daily Beast in which he tried to bluff his way through, calling Krugman’s objection “truly feeble,” and adding: “I very deliberately said ‘the insurance coverage provisions of the ACA,’ not ‘the ACA.’ There is a big difference.” There surely is—not that the readers of the Newsweek cover story would know that. In assailing Krugman, though, Ferguson committed another no-no for journalists and historians: selectively editing a quotation to support his argument. In assessing the financial consequences of Obamacare, a lot depends on whether you believe it will succeed in slowing the annual growth of spending on Medicare from about four per cent, the average rate during the past two decades, to two per cent. Ferguson is skeptical. As it happens, so am I. But he didn’t just say that. Instead, he cited a passage about the Medicare cost cuts from the C.B.O./J.C.T. report, and ended with this quote: “It is unclear whether such a reduction can be achieved…”, thereby implying that the official bean counters had cost doubt on whether the economies would ever materialize. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER How Hard Is It to Find a Cheap Sofa in New York? But note the ellipsis at the end of the quote. Enter Dylan Byers, a media reporter at Politico, with a post entitled “Niall Ferguson’s ridiculous defense.” Byers called up the C.B.O. report and looked up what Ferguson had left out. Here is the sentence in full: It is unclear whether such a reduction can be achieved through greater efficiencies in the delivery of healthcare or will instead reduce access to care or the quality of care (relative to the situation under prior law.) Clearly, this has a rather different meaning than the one Ferguson intended to put across. Byers sums things up this way: So contrary to what Ferguson leads readers to believe, the CBO report does not state that the reduction is “unclear.” What is “unclear” is whether the reduction will come through greater efficiencies in healthcare delivery or reduced access to care. So, one more time: The Oxford-trained, Harvard-employed, Newsweek contibutor Niall Ferguson just edited the CBO report to change its meaning. This isn’t a fair fight. It’s as if Ferguson were inviting Krugman and others to knock him to the canvas, which they are doing with great enthusiasm. At the Atlantic, Matthew O’Brien identifies twelve—yes, a dozen—claims in the Newsweek cover story that don’t stack up, including some misleading figures for job losses and a bizarre suggestion that the Administration’s Wall Street reforms didn’t tackle excessive leverage at the big banks. (A more accurate statement would be that excessive leverage was one of the few big financial issues the Administration did address.) At the Web site of the New York Daily News, David Swerdlick points out that “Niall Ferguson is wrong about Obama’s foreign policy, too.” So, a bad day for Ferguson, not that I’d be overly concerned about him. A feisty and self-confident Glaswegian, he doubtless thinks his journalistic critics are missing the wood for the trees. And if all the attention he has brought to Newsweek helps it to sell a few more copies and survive for a few more months, the consequences of today’s brouhaha won’t be all bad. But what of the right in general? Where does that stand? Reaganism/Thatcherism, for all its faults, was a genuine intellectual movement, or counter-movement. These days, the right seems unable to rise above rabble-rousing. The end of the Cold War robbed it of an external enemy. The tensions between its social and economic wings robbed it of any internal cohesion. The financial crisis and Great Recession robbed it of a creed—laissez faire. It’s still got plenty of willing foot soldiers, and a lot of big money behind it, but where is the fresh thinking and intellectual direction? All that’s left is anti-government posturing, waving the flag, and Obama-bashing. And even in pursuing this limited agenda, it often gets its facts wrong. Photograph by Matt Carr/Getty Images.

What Big Medicine Can Learn from the Cheesecake Factory,58417,"It was Saturday night, and I was at the local Cheesecake Factory with my two teen-age daughters and three of their friends. You may know the chain: a hundred and sixty restaurants with a catalogue-like menu that, when I did a count, listed three hundred and eight dinner items (including the forty-nine on the “Skinnylicious” menu), plus a hundred and twenty-four choices of beverage. It’s a linen-napkin-and-tablecloth sort of place, but with something for everyone. There’s wine and wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, but there’s also buffalo wings and Bud Light. The kids ordered mostly comfort food—pot stickers, mini crab cakes, teriyaki chicken, Hawaiian pizza, pasta carbonara. I got a beet salad with goat cheese, white-bean hummus and warm flatbread, and the miso salmon. The place is huge, but it’s invariably packed, and you can see why. The typical entrée is under fifteen dollars. The décor is fancy, in an accessible, Disney-cruise-ship sort of way: faux Egyptian columns, earth-tone murals, vaulted ceilings. The waiters are efficient and friendly. They wear all white (crisp white oxford shirt, pants, apron, sneakers) and try to make you feel as if it were a special night out. As for the food—can I say this without losing forever my chance of getting a reservation at Per Se?—it was delicious. The chain serves more than eighty million people per year. I pictured semi-frozen bags of beet salad shipped from Mexico, buckets of precooked pasta and production-line hummus, fish from a box. And yet nothing smacked of mass production. My beets were crisp and fresh, the hummus creamy, the salmon like butter in my mouth. No doubt everything we ordered was sweeter, fattier, and bigger than it had to be. But the Cheesecake Factory knows its customers. The whole table was happy (with the possible exception of Ethan, aged sixteen, who picked the onions out of his Hawaiian pizza). I wondered how they pulled it off. I asked one of the Cheesecake Factory line cooks how much of the food was premade. He told me that everything’s pretty much made from scratch—except the cheesecake, which actually is from a cheesecake factory, in Calabasas, California. I’d come from the hospital that day. In medicine, too, we are trying to deliver a range of services to millions of people at a reasonable cost and with a consistent level of quality. Unlike the Cheesecake Factory, we haven’t figured out how. Our costs are soaring, the service is typically mediocre, and the quality is unreliable. Every clinician has his or her own way of doing things, and the rates of failure and complication (not to mention the costs) for a given service routinely vary by a factor of two or three, even within the same hospital. It’s easy to mock places like the Cheesecake Factory—restaurants that have brought chain production to complicated sit-down meals. But the “casual dining sector,” as it is known, plays a central role in the ecosystem of eating, providing three-course, fork-and-knife restaurant meals that most people across the country couldn’t previously find or afford. The ideas start out in élite, upscale restaurants in major cities. You could think of them as research restaurants, akin to research hospitals. Some of their enthusiasms—miso salmon, Chianti-braised short ribs, flourless chocolate espresso cake—spread to other high-end restaurants. Then the casual-dining chains reëngineer them for affordable delivery to millions. Does health care need something like this? Big chains thrive because they provide goods and services of greater variety, better quality, and lower cost than would otherwise be available. Size is the key. It gives them buying power, lets them centralize common functions, and allows them to adopt and diffuse innovations faster than they could if they were a bunch of small, independent operations. Such advantages have made Walmart the most successful retailer on earth. Pizza Hut alone runs one in eight pizza restaurants in the country. The Cheesecake Factory’s major competitor, Darden, owns Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Red Lobster, and the Capital Grille; it has more than two thousand restaurants across the country and employs more than a hundred and eighty thousand people. We can bristle at the idea of chains and mass production, with their homogeneity, predictability, and constant genuflection to the value-for-money god. Then you spend a bad night in a “quaint” “one of a kind” bed-and-breakfast that turns out to have a manic, halitoxic innkeeper who can’t keep the hot water running, and it’s right back to the Hyatt. Medicine, though, had held out against the trend. Physicians were always predominantly self-employed, working alone or in small private-practice groups. American hospitals tended to be community-based. But that’s changing. Hospitals and clinics have been forming into large conglomerates. And physicians—facing escalating demands to lower costs, adopt expensive information technology, and account for performance—have been flocking to join them. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only a quarter of doctors are self-employed—an extraordinary turnabout from a decade ago, when a majority were independent. They’ve decided to become employees, and health systems have become chains. I’m no exception. I am an employee of an academic, nonprofit health system called Partners HealthCare, which owns the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Massachusetts General Hospital, along with seven other hospitals, and is affiliated with dozens of clinics around eastern Massachusetts. Partners has sixty thousand employees, including six thousand doctors. Our competitors include CareGroup, a system of five regional hospitals, and a new for-profit chain called the Steward Health Care System. Steward was launched in late 2010, when Cerberus—the multibillion-dollar private-investment firm—bought a group of six failing Catholic hospitals in the Boston area for nine hundred million dollars. Many people were shocked that the Catholic Church would allow a corporate takeover of its charity hospitals. But the hospitals, some of which were more than a century old, had been losing money and patients, and Cerberus is one of those firms which specialize in turning around distressed businesses. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER For the Love of Bread Cerberus has owned controlling stakes in Chrysler and gmac Financing and currently has stakes in Albertsons grocery stories, one of Austria’s largest retail bank chains, and the Freedom Group, which it built into one of the biggest gun-and-ammunition manufacturers in the world. When it looked at the Catholic hospitals, it saw another opportunity to create profit through size and efficiency. In the past year, Steward bought four more Massachusetts hospitals and made an offer to buy six financially troubled hospitals in south Florida. It’s trying to create what some have called the Southwest Airlines of health care—a network of high-quality hospitals that would appeal to a more cost-conscious public. Steward’s aggressive growth has made local doctors like me nervous. But many health systems, for-profit and not-for-profit, share its goal: large-scale, production-line medicine. The way medical care is organized is changing—because the way we pay for it is changing. Historically, doctors have been paid for services, not results. In the eighteenth century B.C., Hammurabi’s code instructed that a surgeon be paid ten shekels of silver every time he performed a procedure for a patrician—opening an abscess or treating a cataract with his bronze lancet. It also instructed that if the patient should die or lose an eye, the surgeon’s hands be cut off. Apparently, the Mesopotamian surgeons’ lobby got this results clause dropped. Since then, we’ve generally been paid for what we do, whatever happens. The consequence is the system we have, with plenty of individual transactions—procedures, tests, specialist consultations—and uncertain attention to how the patient ultimately fares. Health-care reforms—public and private—have sought to reshape that system. This year, my employer’s new contracts with Medicare, BlueCross BlueShield, and others link financial reward to clinical performance. The more the hospital exceeds its cost-reduction and quality-improvement targets, the more money it can keep. If it misses the targets, it will lose tens of millions of dollars. This is a radical shift. Until now, hospitals and medical groups have mainly had a landlord-tenant relationship with doctors. They offered us space and facilities, but what we tenants did behind closed doors was our business. Now it’s their business, too. The theory the country is about to test is that chains will make us better and more efficient. The question is how. To most of us who work in health care, throwing a bunch of administrators and accountants into the mix seems unlikely to help. Good medicine can’t be reduced to a recipe. Then again neither can good food: every dish involves attention to detail and individual adjustments that require human judgment. Yet, some chains manage to achieve good, consistent results thousands of times a day across the entire country. I decided to get inside one and find out how they did it. Dave Luz is the regional manager for the eight Cheesecake Factories in the Boston area. He oversees operations that bring in eighty million dollars in yearly revenue, about as much as a medium-sized hospital. Luz (rhymes with “fuzz”) is forty-seven, and had started out in his twenties waiting tables at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Los Angeles. He was writing screenplays, but couldn’t make a living at it. When he and his wife hit thirty and had their second child, they came back east to Boston to be closer to family. He decided to stick with the Cheesecake Factory. Luz rose steadily, and made a nice living. “I wanted to have some business skills,” he said—he started a film-production company on the side—“and there was no other place I knew where you could go in, know nothing, and learn top to bottom how to run a business.” To show me how a Cheesecake Factory works, he took me into the kitchen of his busiest restaurant, at Prudential Center, a shopping and convention hub. The kitchen design is the same in every restaurant, he explained. It’s laid out like a manufacturing facility, in which raw materials in the back of the plant come together as a finished product that rolls out the front. Along the back wall are the walk-in refrigerators and prep stations, where half a dozen people stood chopping and stirring and mixing. The next zone is where the cooking gets done—two parallel lines of countertop, forty-some feet long and just three shoe-lengths apart, with fifteen people pivoting in place between the stovetops and grills on the hot side and the neatly laid-out bins of fixings (sauces, garnishes, seasonings, and the like) on the cold side. The prep staff stock the pullout drawers beneath the counters with slabs of marinated meat and fish, serving-size baggies of pasta and crabmeat, steaming bowls of brown rice and mashed potatoes. Basically, the prep crew handles the parts, and the cooks do the assembly. Computer monitors positioned head-high every few feet flashed the orders for a given station. Luz showed me the touch-screen tabs for the recipe for each order and a photo showing the proper presentation. The recipe has the ingredients on the left part of the screen and the steps on the right. A timer counts down to a target time for completion. The background turns from green to yellow as the order nears the target time and to red when it has exceeded it. I watched Mauricio Gaviria at the broiler station as the lunch crowd began coming in. Mauricio was twenty-nine years old and had worked there eight years. He’d got his start doing simple prep—chopping vegetables—and worked his way up to fry cook, the pasta station, and now the sauté and broiler stations. He bounced in place waiting for the pace to pick up. An order for a “hibachi” steak popped up. He tapped the screen to open the order: medium-rare, no special requests. A ten-minute timer began. He tonged a fat hanger steak soaking in teriyaki sauce onto the broiler and started a nest of sliced onions cooking beside it. While the meat was grilling, other orders arrived: a Kobe burger, a blue-cheese B.L.T. burger, three “old-fashioned” burgers, five veggie burgers, a “farmhouse” burger, and two Thai chicken wraps. Tap, tap, tap. He got each of them grilling. I brought up the hibachi-steak recipe on the screen. There were instructions to season the steak, sauté the onions, grill some mushrooms, slice the meat, place it on the bed of onions, pile the mushrooms on top, garnish with parsley and sesame seeds, heap a stack of asparagus tempura next to it, shape a tower of mashed potatoes alongside, drop a pat of wasabi butter on top, and serve. Two things struck me. First, the instructions were precise about the ingredients and the objectives (the steak slices were to be a quarter of an inch thick, the presentation just so), but not about how to get there. The cook has to decide how much to salt and baste, how to sequence the onions and mushrooms and meat so they’re done at the same time, how to swivel from grill to countertop and back, sprinkling a pinch of salt here, flipping a burger there, sending word to the fry cook for the asparagus tempura, all the while keeping an eye on the steak. In producing complicated food, there might be recipes, but there was also a substantial amount of what’s called “tacit knowledge”—knowledge that has not been reduced to instructions. Second, Mauricio never looked at the instructions anyway. By the time I’d finished reading the steak recipe, he was done with the dish and had plated half a dozen others. “Do you use this recipe screen?” I asked. “No. I have the recipes right here,” he said, pointing to his baseball-capped head. He put the steak dish under warming lights, and tapped the screen to signal the servers for pickup. But before the dish was taken away, the kitchen manager stopped to look, and the system started to become clearer. He pulled a clean fork out and poked at the steak. Then he called to Mauricio and the two other cooks manning the grill station. “Gentlemen,” he said, “this steak is perfect.” It was juicy and pink in the center, he said. “The grill marks are excellent.” The sesame seeds and garnish were ample without being excessive. “But the tower is too tight.” I could see what he meant. The mashed potatoes looked a bit like something a kid at the beach might have molded with a bucket. You don’t want the food to look manufactured, he explained. Mauricio fluffed up the potatoes with a fork. I watched the kitchen manager for a while. At every Cheesecake Factory restaurant, a kitchen manager is stationed at the counter where the food comes off the line, and he rates the food on a scale of one to ten. A nine is near-perfect. An eight requires one or two corrections before going out to a guest. A seven needs three. A six is unacceptable and has to be redone. This inspection process seemed a tricky task. No one likes to be second-guessed. The kitchen manager prodded gently, being careful to praise as often as he corrected. (“Beautiful. Beautiful!” “The pattern of this pesto glaze is just right.”) But he didn’t hesitate to correct. “We’re getting sloppy with the plating,” he told the pasta station. He was unhappy with how the fry cooks were slicing the avocado spring rolls. “Gentlemen, a half-inch border on this next time.” He tried to be a coach more than a policeman. “Is this three-quarters of an ounce of Parm-Romano?” And that seemed to be the spirit in which the line cooks took him and the other managers. The managers had all risen through the ranks. This earned them a certain amount of respect. They in turn seemed respectful of the cooks’ skills and experience. Still, the oversight is tight, and this seemed crucial to the success of the enterprise. The managers monitored the pace, too—scanning the screens for a station stacking up red flags, indicating orders past the target time, and deciding whether to give the cooks at the station a nudge or an extra pair of hands. They watched for waste—wasted food, wasted time, wasted effort. The formula was Business 101: Use the right amount of goods and labor to deliver what customers want and no more. Anything more is waste, and waste is lost profit. I spoke to David Gordon, the company’s chief operating officer. He told me that the Cheesecake Factory has worked out a staff-to-customer ratio that keeps everyone busy but not so busy that there’s no slack in the system in the event of a sudden surge of customers. More difficult is the problem of wasted food. Although the company buys in bulk from regional suppliers, groceries are the biggest expense after labor, and the most unpredictable. Everything—the chicken, the beef, the lettuce, the eggs, and all the rest—has a shelf life. If a restaurant were to stock too much, it could end up throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of food. If a restaurant stocks too little, it will have to tell customers that their favorite dish is not available, and they may never come back. Groceries, Gordon said, can kill a restaurant. The company’s target last year was at least 97.5-per-cent efficiency: the managers aimed at throwing away no more than 2.5 per cent of the groceries they bought, without running out. This seemed to me an absurd target. Achieving it would require knowing in advance almost exactly how many customers would be coming in and what they were going to want, then insuring that the cooks didn’t spill or toss or waste anything. Yet this is precisely what the organization has learned to do. The chain-restaurant industry has produced a field of computer analytics known as “guest forecasting.” “We have forecasting models based on historical data—the trend of the past six weeks and also the trend of the previous year,” Gordon told me. “The predictability of the business has become astounding.” The company has even learned how to make adjustments for the weather or for scheduled events like playoff games that keep people at home. A computer program known as Net Chef showed Luz that for this one restaurant food costs accounted for 28.73 per cent of expenses the previous week. It also showed exactly how many chicken breasts were ordered that week ($1,614 worth), the volume sold, the volume on hand, and how much of last week’s order had been wasted (three dollars’ worth). Chain production requires control, and they’d figured out how to achieve it on a mass scale. As a doctor, I found such control alien—possibly from a hostile planet. We don’t have patient forecasting in my office, push-button waste monitoring, or such stringent, hour-by-hour oversight of the work we do, and we don’t want to. I asked Luz if he had ever thought about the contrast when he went to see a doctor. We were standing amid the bustle of the kitchen, and the look on his face shifted before he answered. “I have,” he said. His mother was seventy-eight. She had early Alzheimer’s disease, and required a caretaker at home. Getting her adequate medical care was, he said, a constant battle. Recently, she’d had a fall, apparently after fainting, and was taken to a local emergency room. The doctors ordered a series of tests and scans, and kept her overnight. They never figured out what the problem was. Luz understood that sometimes explanations prove elusive. But the clinicians didn’t seem to be following any coördinated plan of action. The emergency doctor told the family one plan, the admitting internist described another, and the consulting specialist a third. Thousands of dollars had been spent on tests, but nobody ever told Luz the results. A nurse came at ten the next morning and said that his mother was being discharged. But his mother’s nurse was on break, and the discharge paperwork with her instructions and prescriptions hadn’t been done. So they waited. Then the next person they needed was at lunch. It was as if the clinicians were the customers, and the patients’ job was to serve them. “We didn’t get to go until 6 p.m., with a tired, disabled lady and a long drive home.” Even then she still had to be changed out of her hospital gown and dressed. Luz pressed the call button to ask for help. No answer. He went out to the ward desk. The aide was on break, the secretary said. “Don’t you dress her yourself at home?” He explained that he didn’t, and made a fuss. An aide was sent. She was short with him and rough in changing his mother’s clothes. “She was manhandling her,” Luz said. “I felt like, ‘Stop. I’m not one to complain. I respect what you do enormously. But if there were a video camera in here, you’d be on the evening news.’ I sent her out. I had to do everything myself. I’m stuffing my mom’s boob in her bra. It was unbelievable.” His mother was given instructions to check with her doctor for the results of cultures taken during her stay, for a possible urinary-tract infection. But when Luz tried to follow up, he couldn’t get through to her doctor for days. “Doctors are busy,” he said. “I get it. But come on.” An office assistant finally told him that the results wouldn’t be ready for another week and that she was to see a neurologist. No explanations. No chance to ask questions. The neurologist, after giving her a two-minute exam, suggested tests that had already been done and wrote a prescription that he admitted was of doubtful benefit. Luz’s family seemed to encounter this kind of disorganization, imprecision, and waste wherever his mother went for help. “It is unbelievable to me that they would not manage this better,” Luz said. I asked him what he would do if he were the manager of a neurology unit or a cardiology clinic. “I don’t know anything about medicine,” he said. But when I pressed he thought for a moment, and said, “This is pretty obvious. I’m sure you already do it. But I’d study what the best people are doing, figure out how to standardize it, and then bring it to everyone to execute.” This is not at all the normal way of doing things in medicine. (“You’re scaring me,” he said, when I told him.) But it’s exactly what the new health-care chains are now hoping to do on a mass scale. They want to create Cheesecake Factories for health care. The question is whether the medical counterparts to Mauricio at the broiler station—the clinicians in the operating rooms, in the medical offices, in the intensive-care units—will go along with the plan. Fixing a nice piece of steak is hardly of the same complexity as diagnosing the cause of an elderly patient’s loss of consciousness. Doctors and patients have not had a positive experience with outsiders second-guessing decisions. How will they feel about managers trying to tell them what the “best practices” are? In March, my mother underwent a total knee replacement, like at least six hundred thousand Americans each year. She’d had a partial knee replacement a decade ago, when arthritis had worn away part of the cartilage, and for a while this served her beautifully. The surgeon warned, however, that the results would be temporary, and about five years ago the pain returned. She’s originally from Ahmadabad, India, and has spent three decades as a pediatrician, attending to the children of my small Ohio home town. She’s chatty. She can’t go through a grocery checkout line or get pulled over for speeding without learning people’s names and a little bit about them. But she didn’t talk about her mounting pain. I noticed, however, that she had developed a pronounced limp and had become unable to walk even moderate distances. When I asked her about it, she admitted that just getting out of bed in the morning was an ordeal. Her doctor showed me her X-rays. Her partial prosthesis had worn through the bone on the lower surface of her knee. It was time for a total knee replacement. This past winter, she finally stopped putting it off, and asked me to find her a surgeon. I wanted her to be treated well, in both the technical and the human sense. I wanted a place where everyone and everything—from the clinic secretary to the physical therapists—worked together seamlessly. My mother planned to come to Boston, where I live, for the surgery so she could stay with me during her recovery. (My father died last year.) Boston has three hospitals in the top rank of orthopedic surgery. But even a doctor doesn’t have much to go on when it comes to making a choice. A place may have a great reputation, but it’s hard to know about actual quality of care. Unlike some countries, the United States doesn’t have a monitoring system that tracks joint-replacement statistics. Even within an institution, I found, surgeons take strikingly different approaches. They use different makes of artificial joints, different kinds of anesthesia, different regimens for post-surgical pain control and physical therapy. In the absence of information, I went with my own hospital, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Our big-name orthopedic surgeons treat Olympians and professional athletes. Nine of them do knee replacements. Of most interest to me, however, was a surgeon who was not one of the famous names. He has no national recognition. But he has led what is now a decade-long experiment in standardizing joint-replacement surgery. John Wright is a New Zealander in his late fifties. He’s a tower crane of a man, six feet four inches tall, and so bald he barely seems to have eyebrows. He’s informal in attire—I don’t think I’ve ever seen him in a tie, and he is as apt to do rounds in his zip-up anorak as in his white coat—but he exudes competence. “Customization should be five per cent, not ninety-five per cent, of what we do,” he told me. A few years ago, he gathered a group of people from every specialty involved—surgery, anesthesia, nursing, physical therapy—to formulate a single default way of doing knee replacements. They examined every detail, arguing their way through their past experiences and whatever evidence they could find. Essentially, they did what Luz considered the obvious thing to do: they studied what the best people were doing, figured out how to standardize it, and then tried to get everyone to follow suit. They came up with a plan for anesthesia based on research studies—including giving certain pain medications before the patient entered the operating room and using spinal anesthesia plus an injection of local anesthetic to block the main nerve to the knee. They settled on a postoperative regimen, too. The day after a knee replacement, most orthopedic surgeons have their patients use a continuous passive-motion machine, which flexes and extends the knee as they lie in bed. Large-scale studies, though, have suggested that the machines don’t do much good. Sure enough, when the members of Wright’s group examined their own patients, they found that the ones without the machine got out of bed sooner after surgery, used less pain medication, and had more range of motion at discharge. So Wright instructed the hospital to get rid of the machines, and to use the money this saved (ninety thousand dollars a year) to pay for more physical therapy, something that is proven to help patient mobility. Therapy, starting the day after surgery, would increase from once to twice a day, including weekends. Even more startling, Wright had persuaded the surgeons to accept changes in the operation itself; there was now, for instance, a limit as to which prostheses they could use. Each of our nine knee-replacement surgeons had his preferred type and brand. Knee surgeons are as particular about their implants as professional tennis players are about their racquets. But the hardware is easily the biggest cost of the operation—the average retail price is around eight thousand dollars, and some cost twice that, with no solid evidence of real differences in results. Knee implants were largely perfected a quarter century ago. By the nineteen-nineties, studies showed that, for some ninety-five per cent of patients, the implants worked magnificently a decade after surgery. Evidence from the Australian registry has shown that not a single new knee or hip prosthesis had a lower failure rate than that of the established prostheses. Indeed, thirty per cent of the new models were likelier to fail. Like others on staff, Wright has advised companies on implant design. He believes that innovation will lead to better implants. In the meantime, however, he has sought to limit the staff to the three lowest-cost knee implants. These have been hard changes for many people to accept. Wright has tried to figure out how to persuade clinicians to follow the standardized plan. To prevent revolt, he learned, he had to let them deviate at times from the default option. Surgeons could still order a passive-motion machine or a preferred prosthesis. “But I didn’t make it easy,” Wright said. The surgeons had to enter the treatment orders in the computer themselves. To change or add an implant, a surgeon had to show that the performance was superior or the price at least as low. I asked one of his orthopedic colleagues, a surgeon named John Ready, what he thought about Wright’s efforts. Ready was philosophical. He recognized that the changes were improvements, and liked most of them. But he wasn’t happy when Wright told him that his knee-implant manufacturer wasn’t matching the others’ prices and would have to be dropped. “It’s not ideal to lose my prosthesis,” Ready said. “I could make the switch. The differences between manufacturers are minor. But there’d be a learning curve.” Each implant has its quirks—how you seat it, what tools you use. “It’s probably a ten-case learning curve for me.” Wright suggested that he explain the situation to the manufacturer’s sales rep. “I’m my rep’s livelihood,” Ready said. “He probably makes five hundred dollars a case from me.” Ready spoke to his rep. The price was dropped. Wright has become the hospital’s kitchen manager—not always a pleasant role. He told me that about half of the surgeons appreciate what he’s doing. The other half tolerate it at best. One or two have been outright hostile. But he has persevered, because he’s gratified by the results. The surgeons now use a single manufacturer for seventy-five per cent of their implants, giving the hospital bargaining power that has helped slash its knee-implant costs by half. And the start-to-finish standardization has led to vastly better outcomes. The distance patients can walk two days after surgery has increased from fifty-three to eighty-five feet. Nine out of ten could stand, walk, and climb at least a few stairs independently by the time of discharge. The amount of narcotic pain medications they required fell by a third. They could also leave the hospital nearly a full day earlier on average (which saved some two thousand dollars per patient). My mother was one of the beneficiaries. She had insisted to Dr. Wright that she would need a week in the hospital after the operation and three weeks in a rehabilitation center. That was what she’d required for her previous knee operation, and this one was more extensive. “We’ll see,” he told her. The morning after her operation, he came in and told her that he wanted her getting out of bed, standing up, and doing a specific set of exercises he showed her. “He’s pushy, if you want to say it that way,” she told me. The physical therapists and nurses were, too. They were a team, and that was no small matter. I counted sixty-three different people involved in her care. Nineteen were doctors, including the surgeon and chief resident who assisted him, the anesthesiologists, the radiologists who reviewed her imaging scans, and the junior residents who examined her twice a day and adjusted her fluids and medications. Twenty-three were nurses, including her operating-room nurses, her recovery-room nurse, and the many ward nurses on their eight-to-twelve-hour shifts. There were also at least five physical therapists; sixteen patient-care assistants, helping check her vital signs, bathe her, and get her to the bathroom; plus X-ray and EKG technologists, transport workers, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. I didn’t even count the bioengineers who serviced the equipment used, the pharmacists who dispensed her medications, or the kitchen staff preparing her food while taking into account her dietary limitations. They all had to coördinate their contributions, and they did. Three days after her operation, she was getting in and out of bed on her own. She was on virtually no narcotic medication. She was starting to climb stairs. Her knee pain was actually less than before her operation. She left the hospital for the rehabilitation center that afternoon. The biggest complaint that people have about health care is that no one ever takes responsibility for the total experience of care, for the costs, and for the results. My mother experienced what happens in medicine when someone takes charge. Of course, John Wright isn’t alone in trying to design and implement this kind of systematic care, in joint surgery and beyond. The Virginia Mason Medical Center, in Seattle, has done it for knee surgery and cancer care; the Geisinger Health Center, in Pennsylvania, has done it for cardiac surgery and primary care; the University of Michigan Health System standardized how its doctors give blood transfusions to patients, reducing the need for transfusions by thirty-one per cent and expenses by two hundred thousand dollars a month. Yet, unless such programs are ramped up on a nationwide scale, they aren’t going to do much to improve health care for most people or reduce the explosive growth of health-care costs. In medicine, good ideas still take an appallingly long time to trickle down. Recently, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society released new guidelines for migraine-headache-treatment. They recommended treating severe migraine sufferers—who have more than six attacks a month—with preventive medications and listed several drugs that markedly reduce the occurrence of attacks. The authors noted, however, that previous guidelines going back more than a decade had recommended such remedies, and doctors were still not providing them to more than two-thirds of patients. One study examined how long it took several major discoveries, such as the finding that the use of beta-blockers after a heart attack improves survival, to reach even half of Americans. The answer was, on average, more than fifteen years. Scaling good ideas has been one of our deepest problems in medicine. Regulation has had its place, but it has proved no more likely to produce great medicine than food inspectors are to produce great food. During the era of managed care, insurance-company reviewers did hardly any better. We’ve been stuck. But do we have to be? Every six months, the Cheesecake Factory puts out a new menu. This means that everyone who works in its restaurants expects to learn something new twice a year. The March, 2012, Cheesecake Factory menu included thirteen new items. The teaching process is now finely honed: from start to finish, rollout takes just seven weeks. The ideas for a new dish, or for tweaking an old one, can come from anywhere. One of the Boston prep cooks told me about an idea he once had that ended up in a recipe. David Overton, the founder and C.E.O. of the Cheesecake Factory, spends much of his time sampling a range of cuisines and comes up with many dishes himself. All the ideas, however, go through half a dozen chefs in the company’s test kitchen, in Calabasas. They figure out how to make each recipe reproducible, appealing, and affordable. Then they teach the new recipe to the company’s regional managers and kitchen managers. Dave Luz, the Boston regional manager, went to California for training this past January with his chief kitchen manager, Tom Schmidt, a chef with fifteen years’ experience. They attended lectures, watched videos, participated in workshops. It sounded like a surgical conference. Where I might be taught a new surgical technique, they were taught the steps involved in preparing a “Santorini farro salad.” But there was a crucial difference. The Cheesecake instructors also trained the attendees how to teach what they were learning. In medicine, we hardly ever think about how to implement what we’ve learned. We learn what we want to, when we want to. On the first training day, the kitchen managers worked their way through thirteen stations, preparing each new dish, and their performances were evaluated. The following day, they had to teach their regional managers how to prepare each dish—Schmidt taught Luz—and this time the instructors assessed how well the kitchen managers had taught. The managers returned home to replicate the training session for the general manager and the chief kitchen manager of every restaurant in their region. The training at the Boston Prudential Center restaurant took place on two mornings, before the lunch rush. The first day, the managers taught the kitchen staff the new menu items. There was a lot of poring over the recipes and videos and fussing over the details. The second day, the cooks made the new dishes for the servers. This gave the cooks some practice preparing the food at speed, while allowing the servers to learn the new menu items. The dishes would go live in two weeks. I asked a couple of the line cooks how long it took them to learn to make the new food. “I know it already,” one said. “I make it two times, and that’s all I need,” the other said. Come on, I said. How long before they had it down pat? “One day,” they insisted. “It’s easy.” I asked Schmidt how much time he thought the cooks required to master the recipes. They thought a day, I told him. He grinned. “More like a month,” he said. Even a month would be enviable in medicine, where innovations commonly spread at a glacial pace. The new health-care chains, though, are betting that they can change that, in much the same way that other chains have. Armin Ernst is responsible for intensive-care-unit operations in Steward’s ten hospitals. The I.C.U.s he oversees serve some eight thousand patients a year. In another era, an I.C.U. manager would have been a facilities expert. He would have spent his time making sure that the equipment, electronics, pharmacy resources, and nurse staffing were up to snuff. He would have regarded the I.C.U. as the doctors’ workshop, and he would have wanted to give them the best possible conditions to do their work as they saw fit. Ernst, though, is a doctor—a new kind of doctor, whose goal is to help disseminate good ideas. He doesn’t see the I.C.U. as a doctors’ workshop. He sees it as the temporary home of the sickest, most fragile people in the country. Nowhere in health care do we expend more resources. Although fewer than one in four thousand Americans are in intensive care at any given time, they account for four per cent of national health-care costs. Ernst believes that his job is to make sure that everyone is collaborating to provide the most effective and least wasteful care possible. He looked like a regular doctor to me. Ernst is fifty years old, a native German who received his medical degree at the University of Heidelberg before training in pulmonary and critical-care medicine in the United States. He wears a white hospital coat and talks about drips and ventilator settings, like any other critical-care specialist. But he doesn’t deal with patients: he deals with the people who deal with patients. Ernst says he’s not telling clinicians what to do. Instead, he’s trying to get clinicians to agree on precise standards of care, and then make sure that they follow through on them. (The word “consensus” comes up a lot.) What I didn’t understand was how he could enforce such standards in ten hospitals across three thousand square miles. Late one Friday evening, I joined an intensive-care-unit team on night duty. But this team was nowhere near a hospital. We were in a drab one-story building behind a meat-trucking facility outside of Boston, in a back section that Ernst called his I.C.U. command center. It was outfitted with millions of dollars’ worth of technology. Banks of computer screens carried a live feed of cardiac-monitor readings, radiology-imaging scans, and laboratory results from I.C.U. patients throughout Steward’s hospitals. Software monitored the stream and produced yellow and red alerts when it detected patterns that raised concerns. Doctors and nurses manned consoles where they could toggle on high-definition video cameras that allowed them to zoom into any I.C.U. room and talk directly to the staff on the scene or to the patients themselves. The command center was just a few months old. The team had gone live in only four of the ten hospitals. But in the next several months Ernst’s “tele-I.C.U.” team will have the ability to monitor the care for every patient in every I.C.U. bed in the Steward health-care system. A doctor, two nurses, and an administrative assistant were on duty in the command center each night I visited. Christina Monti was one of the nurses. A pixie-like thirty-year-old with nine years’ experience as a cardiac intensive-care nurse, she was covering Holy Family Hospital, on the New Hampshire border, and St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center, in Boston’s Brighton neighborhood. When I sat down with her, she was making her rounds, virtually. First, she checked on the patients she had marked as most critical. She reviewed their most recent laboratory results, clinical notes, and medication changes in the electronic record. Then she made a “visit,” flicking on the two-way camera and audio system. If the patients were able to interact, she would say hello to them in their beds. She asked the staff members whether she could do anything for them. The tele-I.C.U. team provided the staff with extra eyes and ears when needed. If a crashing patient diverts the staff’s attention, the members of the remote team can keep an eye on the other patients. They can handle computer paperwork if a nurse falls behind; they can look up needed clinical information. The hospital staff have an OnStar-like button in every room that they can push to summon the tele-I.C.U. team. Monti also ran through a series of checks for each patient. She had a reference list of the standards that Ernst had negotiated with the people running the I.C.U.s, and she looked to see if they were being followed. The standards covered basics, from hand hygiene to measures for stomach-ulcer prevention. In every room with a patient on a respirator, for instance, Monti made sure the nurse had propped the head of the bed up at least thirty degrees, which makes pneumonia less likely. She made sure the breathing tube in the patient’s mouth was secure, to reduce the risk of the tube’s falling out or becoming disconnected. She zoomed in on the medication pumps to check that the drips were dosed properly. She was not looking for bad nurses or bad doctors. She was looking for the kinds of misses that even excellent nurses and doctors can make under pressure. The concept of the remote I.C.U. started with an effort to let specialists in critical-care medicine, who are in short supply, cover not just one but several community hospitals. Two hundred and fifty hospitals from Alaska to Virginia have installed a version of the tele-I.C.U. It produced significant improvements in outcomes and costs—and, some discovered, a means of driving better practices even in hospitals that had specialists on hand. After five minutes of observation, however, I realized that the remote I.C.U. team wasn’t exactly in command; it was in negotiation. I observed Monti perform a video check on a middle-aged man who had just come out of heart surgery. A soft chime let the people in the room know she was dropping in. The man was unconscious, supported by a respirator and intravenous drips. At his bedside was a nurse hanging a bag of fluid. She seemed to stiffen at the chime’s sound. “Hi,” Monti said to her. “I’m Chris. Just making my evening rounds. How are you?” The bedside nurse gave the screen only a sidelong glance. Ernst wasn’t oblivious of the issue. He had taken pains to introduce the command center’s team, spending weeks visiting the units and bringing doctors and nurses out to tour the tele-I.C.U. before a camera was ever turned on. But there was no escaping the fact that these were strangers peering over the staff’s shoulders. The bedside nurse’s chilliness wasn’t hard to understand. In a single hour, however, Monti had caught a number of problems. She noticed, for example, that a patient’s breathing tube had come loose. Another patient wasn’t getting recommended medication to prevent potentially fatal blood clots. Red alerts flashed on the screen—a patient with an abnormal potassium level that could cause heart-rhythm problems, another with a sudden leap in heart rate. Monti made sure that the team wasn’t already on the case and that the alerts weren’t false alarms. Checking the computer, she figured out that a doctor had already ordered a potassium infusion for the woman with the low level. Flipping on a camera, she saw that the patient with the high heart rate was just experiencing the stress of being helped out of bed for the first time after surgery. But the unsecured breathing tube and the forgotten blood-clot medication proved to be oversights. Monti raised the concerns with the bedside staff. Sometimes they resist. “You have got to be careful from patient to patient,” Gerard Hayes, the tele-I.C.U. doctor on duty, explained. “Pushing hard on one has ramifications for how it goes with a lot of patients. You don’t want to sour whole teams on the tele-I.C.U.” Across the country, several hospitals have decommissioned their systems. Clinicians have been known to place a gown over the camera, or even rip the camera out of the wall. Remote monitoring will never be the same as being at the bedside. One nurse called the command center to ask the team not to turn on the video system in her patient’s room: he was delirious and confused, and the sudden appearance of someone talking to him from the television would freak him out. Still, you could see signs of change. I watched Hayes make his virtual rounds through the I.C.U. at St. Anne’s Hospital, in Fall River, near the Rhode Island border. He didn’t yet know all the members of the hospital staff—this was only his second night in the command center, and when he sees patients in person it’s at a hospital sixty miles north. So, in his dealings with the on-site clinicians, he was feeling his way. Checking on one patient, he found a few problems. Mr. Karlage, as I’ll call him, was in his mid-fifties, an alcoholic smoker with cirrhosis of the liver, severe emphysema, terrible nutrition, and now a pneumonia that had put him into respiratory failure. The I.C.U. team injected him with antibiotics and sedatives, put a breathing tube down his throat, and forced pure oxygen into his lungs. Over a few hours, he stabilized, and the I.C.U. doctor was able to turn his attention to other patients. But stabilizing a sick patient is like putting out a house fire. There can be smoldering embers just waiting to reignite. Hayes spotted a few. The ventilator remained set to push breaths at near-maximum pressure, and, given the patient’s severe emphysema, this risked causing a blowout. The oxygen concentration was still cranked up to a hundred per cent, which, over time, can damage the lungs. The team had also started several broad-spectrum antibiotics all at once, and this regimen had to be dialled back if they were to avoid breeding resistant bacteria. Hayes had to notify the unit doctor. An earlier interaction, however, had not been promising. During a video check on a patient, Hayes had introduced himself and mentioned an issue he’d noticed. The unit doctor stared at him with folded arms, mouth shut tight. Hayes was a former Navy flight surgeon with twenty years’ experience as an I.C.U. doctor and looked to have at least a decade on the St. Anne’s doctor. But the doctor was no greenhorn, either, and gave him the brushoff: “The morning team can deal with that.” Now Hayes needed to call him about Mr. Karlage. He decided to do it by phone. “Sounds like you’re having a busy night,” Hayes began when he reached the doctor. “Mr. Karlage is really turning around, huh?” Hayes praised the doctor’s work. Then he brought up his three issues, explaining what he thought could be done and why. He spoke like a consultant brought in to help. This went over better. The doctor seemed to accept Hayes’s suggestions. Unlike a mere consultant, however, Hayes took a few extra steps to make sure his suggestions were carried out. He spoke to the nurse and the respiratory therapist by video and explained the changes needed. To carry out the plan, they needed written orders from the unit doctor. Hayes told them to call him back if they didn’t get the orders soon. Half an hour later, Hayes called Mr. Karlage’s nurse again. She hadn’t received the orders. For all the millions of dollars of technology spent on the I.C.U. command center, this is where the plug meets the socket. The fundamental question in medicine is: Who is in charge? With the opening of the command center, Steward was trying to change the answer—it gave the remote doctors the authority to issue orders as well. The idea was that they could help when a unit doctor got too busy and fell behind, and that’s what Hayes chose to believe had happened. He entered the orders into the computer. In a conflict, however, the on-site physician has the final say. So Hayes texted the St. Anne’s doctor, informing him of the changes and asking if he’d let him know if he disagreed. Hayes received no reply. No “thanks” or “got it” or “O.K.” After midnight, though, the unit doctor pressed the video call button and his face flashed onto Hayes’s screen. Hayes braced for a confrontation. Instead, the doctor said, “So I’ve got this other patient and I wanted to get your opinion.” Hayes suppressed a smile. “Sure,” he said. When he signed off, he seemed ready to high-five someone. “He called us,” he marvelled. The command center was gaining credibility. Armin Ernst has big plans for the command center—a rollout of full-scale treatment protocols for patients with severe sepsis, acute respiratory-distress syndrome, and other conditions; strategies to reduce unnecessary costs; perhaps even computer forecasting of patient volume someday. Steward is already extending the command-center concept to in-patient psychiatry. Emergency rooms and surgery may be next. Other health systems are pursuing similar models. The command-center concept provides the possibility of, well, command. Today, some ninety “super-regional” health-care systems have formed across the country—large, growing chains of clinics, hospitals, and home-care agencies. Most are not-for-profit. Financial analysts expect the successful ones to drive independent medical centers out of existence in much of the country—either by buying them up or by drawing away their patients with better quality and cost control. Some small clinics and stand-alone hospitals will undoubtedly remain successful, perhaps catering to the luxury end of health care the way gourmet restaurants do for food. But analysts expect that most of us will gravitate to the big systems, just as we have moved away from small pharmacies to CVS and Walmart. Already, there have been startling changes. Cleveland Clinic, for example, opened nine regional hospitals in northeast Ohio, as well as health centers in southern Florida, Toronto, and Las Vegas, and is now going international, with a three-hundred-and-sixty-four-bed hospital in Abu Dhabi scheduled to open next year. It reached an agreement with Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain, guaranteeing a fixed price for cardiac surgery for the company’s employees and dependents. The prospect of getting better care for a lower price persuaded Lowe’s to cover all out-of-pocket costs for its insured workers to go to Cleveland, including co-payments, airfare, transportation, and lodging. Three other companies, including Kohl’s department stores, have made similar deals, and a dozen more, including Boeing, are in negotiations. Big Medicine is on the way. Reinventing medical care could produce hundreds of innovations. Some may be as simple as giving patients greater e-mail and online support from their clinicians, which would enable timelier advice and reduce the need for emergency-room visits. Others might involve smartphone apps for coaching the chronically ill in the management of their disease, new methods for getting advice from specialists, sophisticated systems for tracking outcomes and costs, and instant delivery to medical teams of up-to-date care protocols. Innovations could take a system that requires sixty-three clinicians for a knee replacement and knock the number down by half or more. But most significant will be the changes that finally put people like John Wright and Armin Ernst in charge of making care coherent, coördinated, and affordable. Essentially, we’re moving from a Jeffersonian ideal of small guilds and independent craftsmen to a Hamiltonian recognition of the advantages that size and centralized control can bring. Yet it seems strange to pin our hopes on chains. We have no guarantee that Big Medicine will serve the social good. Whatever the industry, an increase in size and control creates the conditions for monopoly, which could do the opposite of what we want: suppress innovation and drive up costs over time. In the past, certainly, health-care systems that pursued size and market power were better at raising prices than at lowering them. A new generation of medical leaders and institutions professes to have a different aim. But a lesson of the past century is that government can influence the behavior of big corporations, by requiring transparency about their performance and costs, and by enacting rules and limitations to protect the ordinary citizen. The federal government has broken up monopolies like Standard Oil and A.T. & T.; in some parts of the country, similar concerns could develop in health care. Mixed feelings about the transformation are unavoidable. There’s not just the worry about what Big Medicine will do; there’s also the worry about how society and government will respond. For the changes to live up to our hopes—lower costs and better care for everyone—liberals will have to accept the growth of Big Medicine, and conservatives will have to accept the growth of strong public oversight. The vast savings of Big Medicine could be widely shared—or reserved for a few. The clinicians who are trying to reinvent medicine aren’t doing it to make hedge-fund managers and bondholders richer; they want to see that everyone benefits from the savings their work generates—and that won’t be automatic. Our new models come from industries that have learned to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the human beings who work for them. Yet the same industries have also tended to devalue those employees. The frontline worker, whether he is making cars, solar panels, or wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, now generates unprecedented value but receives little of the wealth he is creating. Can we avoid this as we revolutionize health care? Those of us who work in the health-care chains will have to contend with new protocols and technology rollouts every six months, supervisors and project managers, and detailed metrics on our performance. Patients won’t just look for the best specialist anymore; they’ll look for the best system. Nurses and doctors will have to get used to delivering care in which our own convenience counts for less and the patients’ experience counts for more. We’ll also have to figure out how to reward people for taking the time and expense to teach the next generations of clinicians. All this will be an enormous upheaval, but it’s long overdue, and many people recognize that. When I asked Christina Monti, the Steward tele-I.C.U. nurse, why she wanted to work in a remote facility tangling with staffers who mostly regarded her with indifference or hostility, she told me, “Because I wanted to be part of the change.” And we are seeing glimpses of this change. In my mother’s rehabilitation center, miles away from where her surgery was done, the physical therapists adhered to the exercise protocols that Dr. Wright’s knee factory had developed. He didn’t have a video command center, so he came out every other day to check on all the patients and make sure that the staff was following the program. My mother was sure she’d need a month in rehab, but she left in just a week, incurring a fraction of the costs she would have otherwise. She walked out the door using a cane. On her first day at home with me, she climbed two flights of stairs and walked around the block for exercise. The critical question is how soon that sort of quality and cost control will be available to patients everywhere across the country. We’ve let health-care systems provide us with the equivalent of greasy-spoon fare at four-star prices, and the results have been ruinous. The Cheesecake Factory model represents our best prospect for change. Some will see danger in this. Many will see hope. And that’s probably the way it should be. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Club Med,6336,"This year, a few hundred thousand intrepid American travellers will head to places like Thailand and Costa Rica, in search of something that they can’t find in the United States. They won’t be looking for Mayan ruins or ancient Buddhist temples, but something a bit more practical: affordable medical care. These medical tourists will be getting root canals, knee surgeries, and hip replacements at foreign hospitals. If health-care costs in the U.S. keep rising—and especially if Obamacare is overturned by the Supreme Court—more of us may soon be joining them. For decades, wealthy people from developing countries have come here for care, but these days medical tourists travel all over the world. And while it’s hard to disentangle the stats from the hype—a number of countries portray themselves as favored destinations—it’s clear that millions of people are now doing this. The Bumrungrad hospital, in Bangkok, treats four hundred thousand foreign patients annually. Malaysia had almost six hundred thousand medical tourists last year. And South Korea had more than a hundred thousand, nearly a third of them American. For Americans, the attraction is obvious: medical care is a lot cheaper abroad. At cima Hospital, in Costa Rica, for instance, hip-replacement surgery costs around fifteen thousand dollars, roughly a sixth of the average here. So far, though, various factors have kept a lid on demand. Logistics can be challenging, and insurance companies have been leery about reimbursements for care overseas: they already get big discounts with U.S. hospitals, and they risk a public-relations disaster anytime something goes wrong abroad. Above all, patients have been wary. We trust the quality of foreign-made televisions and cars, but we haven’t taken that leap when it comes to foreign doctors. People worry about the lack of legal recourse, and the sheer unfamiliarity of medical tourism makes people hesitant to try it. A few years ago, the grocery-store chain Hannaford set up a partnership for the benefit of its employees with a well-accredited Singaporean hospital. Singapore is one of the most prosperous countries in the world, but medical care there is still significantly cheaper than in the U.S., so the arrangement looked like a model for how medical tourism might work. But none of Hannaford’s workers were interested in going to Singapore. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? There are a host of forces that could change this. The quality of medical facilities in developing countries has risen dramatically, and the private hospitals that cater to tourists often feature technologies similar to those in American hospitals. (This has its problematic side: many of these high-end hospitals are in countries where citizens struggle to get basic care.) Furthermore, new companies are making treatment abroad easier and more attractive. Blue Cross/Blue Shield has started a company called Companion Global Healthcare, which connects patients with hospitals around the world. Political events could also quickly make medical tourism considerably more attractive. If Obamacare is overturned, forty million Americans without insurance will stay that way. If Medicaid and Medicare are cut sharply, the cost of American health care will eventually become prohibitive to many senior citizens. And if health-care costs keep soaring fewer employers will offer health insurance. That doesn’t mean that Americans are soon going to jet halfway around the world for an ingrown toenail, but it’s easy to envisage regional systems becoming common, with Americans heading to places like Costa Rica and Mexico, and Western Europeans going to places like Hungary and Turkey. If more Americans sought care abroad, it wouldn’t just save them money; it could also help control medical costs at home. Medical tourism can be considered a kind of import: instead of the product coming to the consumer, as it does with cars or sneakers, the consumer is going to the product. More medical tourism would increase free trade in medical services, something there has not been much of in the past. The U.S. has been religious about breaking down barriers to free trade, especially in manufacturing and service industries, exposing ordinary workers to foreign competition. But health care has been insulated from the forces of globalization. This has been great for hospitals and doctors, but less good for consumers. It’s one reason that the cost of health care has risen so much faster than that of almost everything else. It has been generally assumed that medicine is inherently a local business. But that would change if we allowed Medicare and Medicaid funds to be spent in foreign hospitals, or if insurers cut consumers in on the savings from treatment abroad. And if domestic hospitals actually had to compete with places like Bumrungrad or cima, the way American car companies have to compete with Toyota and Honda, they might be forced to become more efficient. Even an increase in domestic medical tourism—people journeying to lower-cost U.S. hospitals, like the Cleveland Clinic—would help. There are other ways to bring free trade to medicine, too. As the economist Dean Baker has argued, making it easier for foreign doctors who met standardized requirements to practice in the U.S. would hold down costs and improve service. In addition to exporting patients, we could import doctors. Politically speaking, of course, this all seems improbable, because the medical industry is a powerful lobby and uninterested in competition. But the reality is that, unless we find some other way to rein in health-care costs, the logic of free trade in medicine is going to become harder to resist. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Lizza List: Ten Quotes on the Fate of Health Care,7430,"How did the final day of oral arguments at the Supreme Court about the Affordable Care Act go? Depends on your perspective. Whether or not the Court ultimately strikes down the individual mandate that’s key to the law, its supporters had to be dispirited as they heard the justices wrestle with the question of severability—that is, whether or not the full law has to go if the mandate does. Below, the ten quotes that are key to understanding the day’s proceedings, taken from the transcript released by the Court. (For more, see The New Yorker’s full coverage of this week’s arguments.) Justice Sonia Sotomayor: “We are not in the habit of doing the legislative findings. What we do know is that for those States that found prices increasing, that they found various solutions to that. In one instance, and we might or may not say that it’s unconstitutional, Massachusetts passed the mandatory coverage provision. But others adjusted some of the other provisions. Why shouldn’t we let Congress do that, if in fact, the economists prove, some of the economists prove right, that prices will spiral? What’s wrong with leaving it to—in the hands of the people who should be fixing this, not us?” Justice Antonin Scalia: “All right. The consequence of your proposition, would Congress have enacted it without this provision, okay that’s the consequence. That would mean that if we struck down nothing in this legislation but the—what do you call it, the corn husker kickback, okay, we find that to violate the constitutional proscription of venality, okay? (Laughter.) When we strike that down, it’s clear that Congress would not have passed it without that. It was the means of getting the last necessary vote in the Senate. And you are telling us that the whole statute would fall because the corn husker kickback is bad. That can’t be right.” (N.B.: The so-called Cornhusker kickback was repealed by Congress only days after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “There are so many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay. I think you would concede that reauthorizing what is the Indian Healthcare Improvement Act changes to long benefits, why make Congress redo those? I mean it’s a question of whether we say everything you do is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes, there are many things in here that have nothing to do frankly with the affordable healthcare and there are some that we think it’s better to let Congress to decide whether it wants them in or out. So why should we say it’s a choice between a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting, or a salvage job. And the more conservative approach would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.” Paul Clement, the lawyer arguing against the A.C.A.: “At—at a certain point, I just think that, you know, the better answer might be to say, we’ve struck the heart of this Act, let’s just give Congress a clean slate. If it’s so easy to have that other big volume get reenacted, they can do it in a couple of days; it won’t be a big deal. If it’s not, because it’s very— (Laughter.) Well, but—I mean, you can laugh at me if you want, but the point is, I’d rather suspect that it won’t be easy. Because I rather suspect that if you actually dug into that, there’d be something that was quite controversial in there and it couldn’t be passed quickly.” Chief Justice John Roberts: “This was a piece of legislation which, there was—had to be a concerted effort to gather enough votes so that it could be passed. And I suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the price of the vote. Put in the Indian health care provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages. Put in the black lung provision, and I’ll go along with it. That’s why all—many of these provisions I think were put in, not because they were unobjectionable. So presumably what Congress would have done is they wouldn’t have been able to put together, cobble together, the votes to get it through.” Justice Samuel Alito: “May I ask you about the argument that is made in the economists’ amicus brief? They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry, and that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350 billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and 350 billion from the Medicaid expansion. Now if the 350 billion—maybe you will disagree with the numbers, that they are fundamentally wrong; but assuming they are in the ballpark, if the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which would now be in the—in the hole for $350 billion over 10 years?” Justice Elena Kagan: “I mean, we have never suggested that we were going to say, look, this legislation was a brokered compromise and we are going to try to figure out exactly what would have happened in the complex parliamentary shenanigans that go on across the street and figure out whether they would have made a difference. Instead, we look at the text that’s actually given us. For some people, we look only at the text. It should be easy for Justice Scalia’s clerks.” Justice Anthony Kennedy: “When you say judicial restraint, you are echoing the earlier premise that it increases the judicial power if the judiciary strikes down other provisions of the Act. I suggest to you it might be quite the opposite. We would be exercising the judicial power if one Act was—one provision was stricken and the others remained to impose a risk on insurance companies that Congress had never intended. By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that Congress did not provide for, did not consider. That, it seems to me can be argued at least to be a more extreme exercise of judicial power than to strike—than striking the whole.” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, arguing on behalf of the Obama Administration: “The notion that Congress would have intended the whole Act to fall if there couldn’t be a minimum coverage provision is refuted by the fact that there are many, many provisions of this Act already in effect without a minimum coverage provision. Two point—2 and-a-half million people under 26 have gotten insurance by one of the insurance requirements.” Justice Stephen Breyer: “I would say stay out of politics. That’s for Congress; not us. But the, the question here is, you’ve read all these cases, or dozens, have you ever found a severability case where the Court ever said: Well, the heart of the thing is gone; and, therefore, we strike down these other provisions that have nothing to do with it which could stand on their feet independently and can be funded separately or don’t require money at all.” Rendering of Paul Clement and Justices by Dana Verkouteran/AP Photo.

Obamacare Supreme Court Case Is a Bad Joke,5582,"Forgive me if a wry tone eludes me when it comes to today’s proceedings in the Supreme Court. As far as I am concerned the whole thing is absurd—yet another example of how America’s antiquated system of government, and its determined refusal to accept the economic realities of the modern world, is undermining its future. Early on in this morning’s session, Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, said that the U.S. government had a “very heavy burden of justification” to show that an individual mandate to purchase health-care insurance was constitutional. Really? Only if Kennedy and his Republican-appointed colleagues are willing to throw out economic logic as well as seventy years of legal precedent, which, judging by their harsh questioning of Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, Jr., they may well be. The economics isn’t very complicated. The health-care industry, which makes up about a sixth of the economy, is rife with inefficiency, waste, and coverage gaps. In seeking to remedy some of these problems, the Obama Administration made a deal with the private-insurance industry—the same deal Mitt Romney made when he was governor of Massachusetts. On the one hand, the federal government barred the insurers from discriminating against the sick and the elderly, thereby raising the industry’s costs. On the other hand, the feds obliged uninsured individuals to purchase coverage, thereby expanding the insurers’ revenues. We can argue whether this was the best way to proceed. (At the time the bill was passed, I raised some doubts about how much it would cost.) But it was a straightforward instance of the central government seeking to redress the failures of the private market—something akin to imposing fuel standards on auto manufacturers, providing state pensions, and forcing banks to hold adequate capital reserves. In a modern, interconnected economy, activist government policies to remedy market failures are essential. Rather than confronting this argument head-on, which would involve publicly defending the actions of the banks, the insurers, and the industrial polluters, the right has settled on a strategy of trying to undermine the government through the courts, where its pro-corporate agenda can be repackaged as a defense of ancient freedoms. Thus the bogus constitutional challenge to Obamacare, and, in particular, the individual mandate. As my colleague Jeffrey Toobin pointed out in an excellent post this morning, the issue resolves around the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives the federal government the power to “regulate Commerce … among the several States.” Where does this power begin and end? In the famous 1942 case of Wickard v. Filburn, the Court said that the federal government’s authority extends to any activity that “exerts a substantial economic effect” on commerce crossing state lines. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Skateboarding Is Now an Olympic Sport—and Lizzie Armanto Is Going for Gold The case involved Roscoe Filburn, an Ohio farmer who wanted to grow more wheat than he had been allotted under quotas introduced during the Great Depression to drive up prices. In deciding against Filburn and in favor of the Department of Agriculture, the justices pointed out that the actions of individual wheat farmers, taken together, affect the price of wheat across many states. That is what gives the federal government the power to limit their actions. Under the Wickard v. Filburn standard, the individual mandate is clearly constitutional. If ever there was an industry that crosses state lines, it is health care. As the Solicitor General’s office noted in its brief to the Court on the merits of the case, health-care spending “accounts for 17.6 percent of the nation’s economy.” From a legal perspective, that is where the matter should rest. But, of course, this case isn’t ultimately about the law—it is about politics. The four ultra-conservative justices on the court—Alito, Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas—are in the vanguard of a movement to roll back the federal government and undermine its authority to tackle market failures. The movement began in the nineteen-eighties, when the Federalist Society got its start and Ronald Reagan appointed one of its members, Scalia, to the court—and for thirty years it has been gathering strength. Thus the creation of a new legal theory to sink Obamacare: the idea that while the federal government might well have the authority to regulate economic activity, it doesn’t have the right to regulate inactivity—such as sitting around and refusing to buy health insurance. Now, it is as plain as the spectacles on Antonin Scalia’s nose that opting out of the health-care market is about as realistic as opting out of dying. But necessity is the mother of invention. And, judging by his questions this morning, it is this invention that Kennedy has fastened on. As I said at the beginning, it’s a bad joke—upon us all. Illustration by Dana Verkouteren/AP Photo.

"Debate Cheat Sheet: Newt Up, Mitt Down, Ron Rising",4143,"O.K, admit it: On Saturday night, while Newt Gingrich was busy relating how he has asked God for forgiveness for his adulterous fornications and Mitt Romney was challenging Rick Perry to a ten-thousand-dollar wager, you were out doing the festive rounds. Don’t feel bad. Only a shut-in, a depressive, or a recovering political junkie who has forgotten to take his methadone would willingly spend one of the big social nights of the year watching a two-hour Republican presidential debate. Truly: What sort of a downer would that be? I didn’t watch it either—I had an engagement dinner and a Christmas party to attend—but being a dutiful correspondent, I taped it, read the online coverage, and watched the Sunday-morning political shows to get the opinions of various “professionals” who, a month ago, were treating Romney as a shoo-in and Gingrich as a museum piece. So as a service to the hungover, the apathetic, and the sensible people with better things to do, here is a quick wrap: The conventional wisdom: Newt won. Romney needed to stop Gingrich’s momentum—and he didn’t. Ergo Newt comes out best, and, in fact, it’s worse than that for Mitt. By casually offering to bet Perry more than a fifth of the annual median household disposable income over whether he ever supported an individual mandate for healthcare insurance, he came across as an out-of-touch rich doofus. Sunday-morning money quotes: “At this stage, it would be an upset if Romney won”—Chuck Todd, political editor, NBC News “This is Newt Gingrich’s wheelhouse. Robo-combat—nobody enjoys it like him”—Lisa Myers, NBC News As I saw it: Newt was even more puffed up and annoying than usual. In saying of the Palestinians, “These people are terrorists,”a statement blatantly aimed at the six out of ten Iowa Republicans who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, he answered Hunter Thompson’s famous question about President Nixon’s 1972 campaign: How low do you have to go to be President of this country? Newt, we now know—did we ever doubt it?—will dig all the way to China. Romney, on the other hand, still appears to think he is standing for the rules committee of his country club, or perhaps for chairmanship of the local branch of the A.A.R.P. “Sobriety, care, stability,” he said, listing his virtues. “I am not a bomb-thrower, rhetorically or politically.” Earth to Mitt: this is the Republican Party in 2012. If you can’t figure out how to channel the anger and resentment that drives the grass roots of the party, you won’t make it out of January. Most of the other candidates had their moments, particularly Ron Paul, who poked Gingrich in his most tender spot: the hidden pouch where he stashed the $1.6 million he received from Freddie Mac. As far as the horse race is concerned, Paul is now the big unknown. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media With another solid debate performance behind him, he is well placed to pull an upset in Iowa, where he is running second to Gingrich. “He’s got the most bumper stickers; he’s got the most yard signs; he’s got the most enthusiasm,” Iowa governor Terry Branstad said on “Meet the Press.” Perhaps the biggest strike against Paul is that the pundits are now taking him seriously. He even earned a Sunday-morning money quote of his own: “Ron Paul can win in Iowa”—Jon Karl, ABC News Uh, oh… Mitt Romney, for one, will be hoping that didn't sound the death knell for the Paul surge. Right now, a Paul victory is about the only thing that could slow Gingrich’s momentum. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Drug Test,38923,"The grounds of Glenmore, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw’s estate on the outskirts of Bangalore, were once a palm plantation. Stands of the tropical trees still punctuate the land around her house, which she built in the style of a Spanish hacienda, with a central courtyard and a red tile roof. Inside, the collection of Indian and Scottish art that she has amassed with her Glaswegian husband—mostly landscapes and Gauguinesque still-lifes—is displayed on cream-colored walls. It is a lovely and peaceful place, but not quite what you’d expect from the richest woman in the country, which is how Mazumdar-Shaw, who in 1978 founded Biocon, the largest biotechnology company in the country, is invariably described in the Indian press. The appellation isn’t precise. “I know families who have a girl child in whose name there’s more inherited money,” Mazumdar-Shaw’s friend Vijay Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher Airlines and one of the richest men in India, said. “But for somebody who owns and manages a business she’s the richest—the richest self-made woman.” In fact, there is very little competition. Though modern Indian history is dotted with women in positions of authority, their power can invariably be traced to a husband or a father or a brother, as was the case with Indira Gandhi and, more recently, Sonia Gandhi, or the billionaire Savitri Jindal, who became the chairperson of the steel producer the O.P. Jindal Group after her husband died. Even many of India’s male C.E.O.s are the scions of established dynasties. But Mazumdar-Shaw has become wealthy—and extremely influential—by sidestepping Indian tradition. Between Glenmore and the throbbing traffic jams of downtown Bangalore, there are stretches of bean fields and clusters of corrugated-tin shacks where people live without electricity or running water. One bright morning, just after an early conference call and before being driven to the office in a chauffeured Mercedes, Mazumdar-Shaw sat on her terrace with her husband, John Shaw, eating a breakfast of sliced fruit. “Living in a place like ours, you could be in California,” she said, motioning toward the swimming pool. Mazumdar-Shaw, who is fifty-eight, was wearing a gray linen jacket and carrying a Prada handbag; her hair was carefully blow-dried. “Then you step outside and see poverty,” she continued. “That’s not a nice feeling.” In 2004, Biocon held an I.P.O., which brought Mazumdar-Shaw’s net worth to half a billion dollars. (It is now almost double that.) Not long afterward, she started the Biocon Foundation, to administer her philanthropic work. “I thought, What do I want to do with all my money?” she said. “Why don’t I do something in health care, because I’m in it.” In 2009, she opened the Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center, a fourteen-hundred-bed facility that accommodates patients who can’t pay for treatment, and she has launched a series of ambitious initiatives—clinics, a grassroots health-monitoring network, a micro-insurance program—that she hopes will provide a model for widespread reform of health care. Mazumdar-Shaw’s main work is creating drugs, which, if they work, have the potential both to improve the lives of poor Indians and to make her even wealthier. One medication will treat vitiligo, a pigment disease that leaves sufferers with light patches of skin. Another drug, now in clinical trials, will treat rheumatoid arthritis. “In India, they like to sit on the floor and do a lot of things with their hands,” she said, “and it was quite sad to see these women” with the disease. “They couldn’t even squat like they normally do. They couldn’t raise their hands. They were all kind of shrivelled up. And six months later they were so happy! They were showing us how they could raise their hands and they could squat.” Blotchy skin and arthritis don’t sound like particularly pernicious ailments to Western ears, but in India three-quarters of the country’s 1.2 billion citizens live in villages, where life hasn’t changed much in centuries. People with vitiligo often find it difficult to get married—even their cousins and siblings are seen as tainted—and arthritics are unable to do the manual labor that dominates the rural economy. If people can’t work, or if they can’t be matched with a mate, they can become outcasts. “There are two Indias,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. There is the burgeoning capitalist power, of which she is a leader and an emblem, and there is the old, broken country, to which the majority of the population still belongs. Mazumdar-Shaw’s strategy, in business and in philanthropy, is to heal the old India by beating the West at its own game. Bangalore was known as India’s “garden city,” a green and sleepy place touted as a retiree’s paradise, when Kiran Mazumdar and her two brothers grew up there, in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. There was none of the berserk traffic or frantic commerce that are now the city’s hallmarks; Bangalore had yet to spawn its neighbor, Electronics City, touted as the outsourcing capital of the world. Their father, Rasendra Mazumdar, who was known as Mazzy, was the brewmaster at United Breweries Ltd., the biggest brewer in the country. His family enjoyed a comfortable, predictable life, dominated by the rhythms of brewing beer. “ ‘My father has to “mash-in” the day’s brew at 5 a.m.,’ I would tell my friends, after which he would play nine holes of golf, come home for a shower and some breakfast before he returned to the brewery,” Mazumdar-Shaw wrote in her book “Ale and Arty: The Story of Beer,” in 2000. “On weekends, my brother Ravi and I used to visit the brewery, where we loved the warmth and the wonderful malty aroma.” Her family lived in the brewery’s staff compound, an enclave of tidy cottages that might not have seemed out of place in the Cotswolds. “The United Breweries group was started by the British,” Mazumdar-Shaw’s childhood playmate Pratima Rao, the daughter of the brewery’s technical director, said. “The houses were built in somewhat of a colonial style: a bungalow with a garden and a broad driveway. There were three of these bungalows, then there was this extraordinarily large house that the Mallyas”—the owners of the brewery—“lived in.” Mazumdar was a confident and persuasive child. “Kiran loved bullying me,” Vijay Mallya, the owner’s son, who has since inherited the brewery, said. “She told me if I ran around the house twenty times I’d get to the moon, and I did it.” Mazumdar-Shaw graduated from Bangalore University with a double major in biology and zoology, and intended to be a doctor, but when she applied for a scholarship, she told me, “I flunked the psychological test.” The scholarship was denied. “They said, You are psychologically not fit to be a doctor. And actually they are right, because I have a real fear of blood.” In an interview with Forbes India, Mazumdar-Shaw said that she asked her father to pay for medical school, and he refused. “ ‘Kiran,’ he said, ‘you must learn about meritocracy.’ I threw a fit.” India was a socialist country, dominated by inherited hierarchy and loyalties to region, religion, and caste, but in the Mazumdar household a different set of values obtained: secular humanism and survival of the fittest. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Her father suggested that she become a brewmaster. She remembers him telling her, “It’s an applied science—it’s got fermentation, it’s about microbiology, it’s about genetics, it’s about anything you want.” She moved to Australia to study the biology of beer at the University of Ballarat, outside Melbourne. “It was a kind of transformational time for me,” she said. She was the only woman in her class, living on her own for the first time, and in a remote country. “In those days, there was no e-mail, there was hardly any telephone.” But she found the cosmopolitan environment invigorating. “We had Kenyans, Indians, Filipinos, Australians,” she said. She distinguished herself with her sturdy competence and her propulsive ambition. “I had a great time,” she said. “First and foremost, I could compete with them academically, which was a good confidence builder.” She returned home in 1975 and began looking for a job, but she quickly found that there were few opportunities for a female brewmaster in India. “I don’t remember any girls working in the brewery anywhere,” Vijay Mallya told me. “Science and girls were not associated.” She found work as a consultant, troubleshooting for breweries, but nobody would trust her with a position of real responsibility. “That’s when the reality check took place,” she said. She was told repeatedly that a woman could not handle the unions, the venders, and the management of male employees. “I saw all these guys. I said, My God, they’re so incompetent! They can’t even solve your problems—I came and solved it for you!” She had been raised to believe that she was her brothers’ equal, but her country, she realized, saw things differently. “The girl child is something we’ve always grappled with,” she said. Honor killings are still an occasional occurrence; as many as half of Indian women can’t read or write. She was on the verge of “storming off in a huff” to work as a brewmaster in Scotland when an Irish businessman named Leslie Auchincloss approached her. He was starting an enzyme-production company, and he wanted to have a branch in India, where papayas grow, so that he could extract the enzyme papain from the fruits. It was the era of the “License Raj,” a labyrinthine system of permits and controls adopted under Nehru, and Auchincloss needed an Indian partner to help him navigate the bureaucracy; an employee of his who had gone to school at Ballarat recommended Mazumdar. “I said no, no, no,” she told me. “I really am the worst partner to have: a) I’m a woman, and I’ve just been told in this country women don’t make good managers, b) I don’t have any money to invest, and c) I have zero business experience. I don’t know why you want to even discuss this with me.” She introduced Auchincloss to another potential partner, in Delhi, but he told her, “I don’t know why you’re pushing this guy in my face—I need you. I can tell you have it in you to start a company, because I’m an entrepreneur and you have just as much spunk as me.” She agreed to a seventy-per-cent stake in Biocon, and, working out of the garage of a rented one-bedroom house, she began making enzymes from papaya and catfish, along with enzymes for fermenting beer. The biotechnology industry was just coming into existence; Genentech, the pioneering biotech corporation in California, had started only two years earlier. “To be very honest, I had no idea what I was heading for,” she said. “I just started.” Pratima Rao began working for Mazumdar in 1979, the year Biocon became the first Indian company to export enzymes to the United States and Europe. (It created an enzyme for Ocean Spray, which the company used in its juices for twenty years.) “In the garage days, we were working with a telex machine, like a typewriter, and God alone knows whether it gets to the other side or not,” Rao said. The two women—in their twenties, with no experience in business—were perceived as a novelty. “I remember going with her to meet the pollution-control chief, and some of these big government officers might have been kind of amused when these two young girls came to talk about setting up a factory,” Rao said. “But Kiran is impervious to any kind of deterrent.” To get from downtown Bangalore to Biocon Park, the largest biotechnology facility in India, one starts out inching through thick urban traffic interrupted by cows. Hijras, cross-dressing youths with long hair in bright saris, beg for change at stoplights. In January, 2010, after a long delay, the Hosur Road Elevated Expressway—a six-mile, four-lane highway that hulks inelegantly over the city’s exurbs—opened to great fanfare. (Mazumdar-Shaw and other local celebrities attended the ribbon cutting.) The highway was supposed to facilitate a twenty-minute commute to Electronics City, where Biocon, Infosys, and Hewlett-Packard have their headquarters, but because it is always hopelessly jammed the ride takes at least an hour. Mazumdar-Shaw built her company’s ninety-acre campus in 2005, to accommodate five thousand employees, just down the road from her original compound. At the entrance is an enormous sculpture of a double helix with the words “Recombinant Revolution” at its base. Everywhere you look in Biocon Park, there are wet, green lawns and people in lab coats: white for the technicians operating state-of-the-art machinery behind thick glass, blue for the dark-skinned lower-caste women moving dust from place to place with twig brooms in the hallways. Mazumdar-Shaw works a few doors down from her husband, who became Biocon’s vice-chairman in 2001, three years after the couple married. Her office is modest, decorated with mementos and photographs: Mazumdar-Shaw (dressed, uncharacteristically, in a sari) receiving India’s highest civilian honor, the Padma Bhushan, from President Abdul Kalam; a framed caricature of her with a double helix over her head, which ran in the Times of India; a closeup of her late father, grinning. Outside the window is an almond tree, where Mazumdar-Shaw sprinkled his ashes after he died, in 1993. “He didn’t live long enough to see me at this level,” she said, “but he was very proud of everything I did.” Her father’s competitive ethos has, at times, been reflected in Mazumdar-Shaw’s management style. In the early years of Biocon, she intended to create “a flat organization,” in which all of her fifty-some employees “would have a sense of ownership.” But in 1985 the unions revolted. “These were rabid labor unions—in those days, Communist labor unions,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. She couldn’t understand why her employees would define themselves as her opponents. “ ‘I treat you so well! I’m paying the highest wages in this area. I’m looking after my people better than any other company,’ ” she said. “They said, ‘Madame, we agree with you, we are very happy—it’s for the future.’ And then a lot of them told me they are very scared.” They were afraid that they would suffer harassment or violence if they didn’t join, she said. “These are uneducated, unskilled people. My great idealistic dream that I can lift these guys and make them improve their lives is not working, so maybe I need to now get only educated people who will understand what I’m trying to do. I told these guys, ‘If you join the union, I’m going to automate, and you’ll all be out of jobs.’ ” She remembers getting late-night calls from union leaders threatening that workers would throw acid in her face. “I said, ‘Are you a man or a mouse? If you talk to a woman like this, it just shows you have no spunk.’ ” She would arrive at work to find groups of picketers burning her effigy in front of the office. “I used to joke and say I never wear a sari, so that’s not me,” she said. She gave her workers severance and automated their jobs. Mazumdar-Shaw gradually expanded from producing enzymes to creating biosimilars, the biotech equivalent of generic drugs. In 1989, Auchincloss sold his share of Biocon to the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, and she started thinking about how to sell her company’s expertise in an international market. In the nineties, businesses around the world started panicking about what would happen to their systems when the year 2000 came. As fears of a Y2K bug grew, businesses turned to India, where technological talent was plentiful and cheap. Mazumdar-Shaw saw an opportunity: “If the I.T. sector can provide business solutions, why can’t we provide research solutions?” She started a new company, Syngene, in 1994, to develop drug components for international pharmaceutical companies. Mazumdar-Shaw was again at the front of a profitable trend: today, there are dozens of Indian companies conducting research for Western firms. But it was difficult to attract talent at first. The industry was just emerging, and many Indians of her generation were seeking their fortunes abroad. The United States Immigration Act of 1990 had created a new visa category that enabled American businesses to hire foreigners in “specialty occupations,” such as science, engineering, and information technology. In the next decade, more than three hundred thousand college-educated Indians came to the U.S., according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. Among Mazumdar-Shaw’s early recruits was Dr. Nita Roy, who was raised in Calcutta, studied molecular biology at Cornell, and conducted research for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan. Roy served as the company’s head of biology until a month ago. (She is now at L’Oréal India.) “Syngene was India’s first—maybe Asia’s first—contract research company for pharma and biotech,” Roy told me at her office in Biocon Park, where she had hung photographs of herself on safari, petting South African cheetahs. “Everyone thought I was making the wrong decision, because there was nothing going on here. People thought I was really mad.” It was also difficult to convince clients that they could trust scientists on the other side of the world. “You know how Americans think,” Roy said. When she first came to the United States, “people used to ask me, ‘Do you have beds?’ Nothing was known about India.” What the company offered, though, was labor at enormous savings. Initially, multinational companies hired Syngene for basic research, working on a single piece of a complex puzzle. Now more than sixty firms send over their high-level research and development. “We were given D to K—now we are given A to Z,” Roy said. “Cost is no longer the only factor. Now it’s about talent.” Developing drugs is expensive and risky. Only one compound in ten thousand becomes a salable drug, and the testing process can take decades and cost more than a billion dollars. Research costs considerably less in India than it does in the United States. “If you are a large Western pharmaceutical company, and you want to hedge your bets, you start your own centers in India, China, Brazil,” Devesh Kapur, the director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Advanced Study of India, said. “It’s not surprising, if you believe talent is distributed roughly equally across populations. With the sheer size of China or India, the top one per cent is going to be pretty good.” Roy told me that what she does is “very different from selling a product. You are selling expertise. When you sell science to people, they are threatened—these are Indians taking your jobs. We have to convince them we are not threatening you. We are complementing you. While you are sleeping, your Indian lab is working.” Of course, another way to look at it is that scientists who used to be hired in America are now hired in India. By some estimates, Western pharmaceutical companies will lose a third of their income in the next three years as patents expire; Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world, came off patent on November 30th. In order to show growth for investors, some companies are compensating for these losses by liquidating their research departments. “It’s a vicious circle: no R. & D. investment, no drugs, no revenue, no R. & D. investment,” Mardi Dier, the C.F.O. of Portola Pharmaceuticals, in San Francisco, said. “The model is broken.” Pankaj Chandra, the director of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, argues that developing drugs in India will ultimately help Western companies. “In the U.S., if you make a drug, there’s no way the market in India or Africa is available to you—the cost structure makes it impossible,” Chandra said. “But if you develop in India you are able to sell at a much lower price, and then you have access to an enormous market. Now, where does that money go? Back into the company—not to the Indian government or Syngene.” Indian companies are beginning to send jobs to the West, too. Tata Group, a Mumbai-based company that owns Jaguar Land Rover, is now the U.K.’s largest employer in manufacturing. “Before the Internet, when every part of the world was insulated,” Mazumdar-Shaw said, “a company could be an island unto itself.” But that is no longer realistic. “If you are not smart enough to figure that out, then don’t think the world is going to wait for you.” Since 1996, Biocon has been developing its own pharmaceuticals, in addition to generics. “I would love to see one of our novel drugs make it big with the ‘Made in India’ label,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. Biocon is in stage-three clinical trials on both a cancer-treatment drug and a variety of insulin that can be taken orally—a product that has long been the pharmaceutical industry’s “holy grail,” several American pharmaceutical executives told me. India has an estimated fifty million diabetics and one of the world’s highest rates of fatality from the disease: about a million Indians died from complications last year. “But diabetes is a huge area—across the world,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. “As the world becomes more affluent, diabetes gets worse. Oral insulin is Biocon’s big bet.” Last year, Pfizer paid Biocon two hundred million dollars to license its generic insulin, which will be increasingly profitable after several competing products go off patent, starting in 2015. (Mazumdar-Shaw chose October 18th to close the Pfizer deal; her mother had consulted the Hindu calendar, and advised her that it was an auspicious date.) And, if Biocon’s oral insulin makes it through clinical trials, Pfizer’s network will enable her to sell the drug around the world. “I grew up being apologetic about India,” Mazumdar-Shaw told Forbes India. “I felt a strong urge in me to create something that would be a piece of the new India. I did not want the next generation to feel apologetic.” In the village of Huskur, about half an hour’s drive from Biocon Park, Dr. Prakash Sankalagere Chikkaputtaswamy operates a three-room clinic, established by a Biocon Foundation program called Arogya Raksha Yojana, or Health Help. Chikkaputtaswamy serves fifty thousand patients within a ten-mile radius, and the most common ailment, he says, is “diabetes foot.” Most of the locals do not wear shoes, and “gangrene is easy to form if you are diabetic and get a wound.” Another persistent malady is “cancer cheek,” which afflicts tobacco chewers. India accounts for eighty-six per cent of oral cancer in the world, and, because patients rarely seek help before the disease is advanced, it often creates holes in their faces. In addition to constructing the Huskur clinic and nine others like it in the state of Karnataka, the Arogya Raksha program has started a micro-insurance program and hired local girls to go door to door offering screening services for oral cancer. The girls ask questions about life style, and, if people complain of mouth sores or other maladies, they take cell-phone pictures of the lesions, to send to the “tumor board” at the Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center. If a malignancy is detected, the girls return to encourage the patients to visit their local clinic. “Girls are easier to find locally because guys go to cities,” Chikkaputtaswamy said. “And they’re quite polite.” Local officials have visited the clinics and encouraged people to join the network; in some cases, they pay the premiums for those who are too poor to do it themselves. The difference between health care for the rich and for the poor in India is striking. The country’s private hospitals are so good that medical tourists from Britain and other wealthy nations come to get world-class care at a fraction of the price at home. But India spends barely one per cent of its G.D.P. on primary health care, and the maternal mortality rate is two hundred and thirty per hundred thousand live births—six times the rate in China. One afternoon in her office, Mazumdar-Shaw showed me some pictures from Arogya Raksha clinics. “It’s quite awful,” she warned, as she opened an image of a woman with a tumor on her chest the size of a grapefruit. “She had maggots on it,” Mazumdar-Shaw said, and shivered. “You say, ‘My God—how can they even live with it?’ They think it’s just a sore. Can you imagine how uneducated these people are?” Mazumdar-Shaw’s idea is that rural communities can become their own early-detection networks, catching maladies before they require expensive treatment. “And it’s scalable—that’s the beauty of it,” she said. “It can be taken to Africa, even to America.” She wants it to catch on across India first; she hosts a weekly talk show, “India’s Healthcare Challenge,” on Bloomberg UTV, aimed at shaping public opinion on the topic. “In the next five years, if we can actually put in place a national health system,” she said, “that would be awesome.” Mazumdar-Shaw says that she has been “shouting myself hoarse” for years to convince the government that improved health care will be necessary to pull India’s vast underclass—about a third of the population—into modern prosperity. “Politicians are a very strange lot,” she said. “They’re the most corrupt, but, when they see people like us who are success stories despite their presence, they have respect. That’s when you use that clout to shape them.” The Indian government is famously corrupt; according to Edward Luce, in his 2007 book, “In Spite of the Gods: The Rise of Modern India,” nearly a fifth of parliament members have been indicted for at least one crime. “Many people, especially foreigners, do not appreciate the extent of corruption in India,” a former Cabinet secretary told Luce. “They think it is an additional nuisance to the system. What they do not realize is that in many respects and in many parts of India it is the system.” In the absence of strong social programs, it is not uncommon for villagers to show up at the front gate of Glenmore seeking help. Civic-minded business leaders play an increasingly prominent role in “picking up the pieces” of Indian society, as Devesh Kapur put it. About eighty per cent of hospitals, for instance, are privately owned. He compared modern India to the United States of the eighteen-nineties, when robber barons helped create infrastructure and public works. “It will be one of the big historical questions in fifty years: Can the private sector compensate for the state’s failures?” Mazumdar-Shaw has become a kind of national mascot for rectitude. “Her company is run with deep corporate nationalism—you know there is going to be no tax fiddle,” Suhel Seth, a marketing consultant who writes a column for the Calcutta Telegraph, told me. In the Indian press, her opinion is solicited on everything from sanitation to plastic surgery. When the activist Anna Hazare undertook a hunger strike to protest corruption, Mazumdar-Shaw tweeted support for him to her followers. As always, she hopes that the free market will help. “Bridging the gap between supply and demand will greatly cut corruption,” she has said. “Years ago, we had to pay a bribe to get a landline approved and fixed. Today, landline companies are queuing up at your doorstep.” But it has not been easy convincing villagers that they need health coverage. India’s literacy rate is only seventy-four per cent, and it is significantly worse in rural areas. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the champion of the caste that used to be known as untouchables, described the villages as a “den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism.” There, the notion of paying for something intangible has proved bewildering. “The first few years have been miserable failures,” Mazumdar-Shaw told me. “You roll out an insurance program to poor people, and they’re saying, So you want me to pay a hundred and fifty rupees a year and what if I don’t fall ill? I say, Guys! If you don’t use it, you should feel very happy! If you do fall ill, imagine—for a hundred and fifty rupees you will be getting thousands of rupees of treatments, which you otherwise can’t afford!” The program now serves sixty thousand people, and it recently reached a hundred-per-cent reënrollment. “We’re helping change the behavioral-psychological factors of rural folk,” Mazumdar-Shaw said, with satisfaction. Although charity is not prevalent among wealthy Indians—they give at about a quarter of the rate of Americans—Mazumdar-Shaw has spent fifteen million dollars on her hospital and Arogya Raksha. Still, she told me that she thinks of herself as a “compassionate capitalist,” not a philanthropist, because “we must get away from this mind-set of charity.” One-time donations—what she describes as a “turn-on, turn-off mentality”—won’t bring change; the market has to adjust. At the Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center, for example, the wealthy pay market price for MRIs and other diagnostic procedures, subsidizing discounts for the poor, but they are compensated with convenience. “At 4 a.m., it’s free, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. it’s full price, 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. it’s half price,” Mazumdar-Shaw explained. Everybody gets their needs met, but everybody gets what they pay for. Bangalore society, like much of India’s upper class, is a tight group. “The thing about India is it’s a billion people, but everybody knows everybody at the creamy layer,” John Shaw told me one evening, as he stood with his wife by the pool at the Taj West End hotel, drinking wine and wearing an emerald-green jacket and tasselled loafers. They were attending a book party for Shobhaa Dé—“the Joan Collins of India,” in Mazumdar-Shaw’s description—and waiters were circulating among the uplit potted palms, bearing trays of little ceramic spoons filled with salmon tartare. Dé, a former model, is the author of seventeen books, which Shaw estimated “must’ve taken her about seventeen minutes to write.” I asked if they were good friends. He explained that in India, at least in the creamy layer, “any friend of my friend is my friend. It’s like living in Facebook.” Entertaining was tricky, he said, because “when you have a party you have no idea how many people will come. Fortunately, with a lot of the Indian cooking you just add more gravy.” Shaw considers Indians “very gregarious people—even though they were all together last night, they want to all get together tonight.” Indeed, most of the people standing around him had seen one another on the preceding evening, at the local maharaja’s palace, where A. R. Rahman, “the Mozart of Madras,” gave a concert to celebrate a new, Indian-made Toyota. The staging of the event made Las Vegas seem minimalist. At one point, Rahman was carried out on a throne, while dancers circled the Toyota as it spun onstage—a depiction, the m.c. said, of the “dream to build a car for Indians by Indians in India.” Money in India—even old money—does not tend to be displayed in an understated fashion. Mazumdar-Shaw’s old friend Vijay Mallya, nicknamed the King of Good Times, owns hundreds of vintage cars, a castle in Scotland, a cricket team, the Force India Formula One racing team, and Gandhi’s eyeglasses and sandals. Mazumdar-Shaw’s greatest indulgence is buying a lot of paintings. After her father died, she cheered up her mother by buying her a laundromat to run. But because Mazumdar-Shaw is famous for being the richest woman in India, she said, “the connotation is that I’m sort of wallowing in wealth—it conjures up this vision that I have all these jets and yachts.” “One of the things that Kiran’s very pleased about is she can wear costume jewelry,” Shaw said, “and because she’s got this tag everyone thinks— ” “ ‘Oh, my God, it’s very expensive diamonds,’ ” Mazumdar-Shaw interjected, pulling on her necklace, a strand of beads. After the group of about fifty people finished their cocktails—despite her background, Mazumdar-Shaw was drinking wine, not beer—they filed into a banquet room for a discussion of Dé’s new book, “Shobhaa at Sixty.” On the panel were the author, Mazumdar-Shaw, and Geetanjali Kirloskar, the wife of the industrialist Vikram Kirloskar, who had hosted the previous evening’s Toyota party. “Typical stag night,” Suhel Seth told me. “Kiran was the stag, as it were, and John was the spouse.” Mazumdar-Shaw thinks of her husband as “a very secure person” who is comfortable in his supporting role. “After we got married,” John Shaw recalled, “we sat down and Kiran said, ‘Now, John. You’ve got a career in the textile industry. I’ve got a career in the biotech industry. One of us has got to give up our career, and it’s not me.’” When he looked at her ledgers, he agreed. Shaw had first come to Bangalore in 1991, for his job as the chairman of Madura Coats Ltd., a large textile company, and he felt immediately at home. After growing up in Scotland, he was delighted by balmy Bangalore. “In the old days, it was a ‘no-fan station,’ ” Shaw told me. “That’s an old colonial epithet: people who were posted to Bangalore were not given any allowance to buy fans, because the climate was considered so good.” He met Kiran Mazumdar at parties, and they would talk mostly about business. “We were both so involved in our careers that any personal thing just wasn’t a consideration,” he said. Mazumdar-Shaw’s parents had an arranged marriage, which is still the norm—as many as ninety per cent of Indian marriages are arranged by family. “Her dad was a very progressive guy for the India of that time,” Shaw said. “He said, ‘Don’t do the usual thing and pretend to study while you wait to get married.’ ” This suited Mazumdar, who had always been focussed on her studies. “Kiran was a nerd, O.K.?” Pratima Rao said. “Kiran is a Gujarati Brahmin, I’m a Karnataka Brahmin, so our parents would automatically get offers from boys in our communities. Such offers did come Kiran’s way, but she did not find any of them suitable.” In 1997, Shaw’s company relocated him to Holland. His move to Europe was “the great catalyst” for their romance, he said: “It was only when I went to Amsterdam that I realized how much I missed Kiran.” (Mazumdar-Shaw’s mother told me that she’d foreseen the match: “He likes golf; Kiran likes golf. He’s a C.E.O.; Kiran’s a C.E.O.”) When she visited him on a business trip, he proposed. At the Taj, Mazumdar-Shaw looked modest and manicured in linen pants and a blue Mao-collared jacket. She isn’t skinny, and she does not wear high heels—she was the only one of the panelists who did not look like a candidate for “The Real Housewives of Bangalore.” Dé was wearing rhinestone-encrusted slingbacks and a one-shouldered black caftan that showcased her perfectly muscled arms. “Men are fat cats at sixty,” she said. “Men can and do re-start life at sixty. But a woman’s options at sixty are limited.” Mazumdar-Shaw twiddled her thumbs as she listened, genially detached. Dé talked about a village in India where, “on a woman’s sixtieth birthday, the family feeds her poison and she’s asked to go off and quietly die, because she’s no longer of any use.” Kirloskar, who was wearing a hot-pink shalwar kameez and a massive diamond ring, said, “Even in my class, a woman is supposed to just be married and not be preoccupied with herself.” Then they talked about the aging process, and Dé, who is sixty-three but looks about thirty-six, expressed her distaste for plastic surgery and recommended that women, instead, “just let it all hang out.” Mazumdar-Shaw smirked. “I hope you’ll permit me, I just thought of a song,” she said, and offered an improvised rhyme: “Shobhaa, tell us. All modern women are jealous. How do you manage to look so terribly young, without Botox and suctions and treatments far flung?” The audience laughed and applauded, and then Mazumdar-Shaw concluded, “It’s the wrinkles of your mind that are more important than the wrinkles on your skin.” It isn’t easy being indefatigable. Mazumdar-Shaw was grumpy, for her, when I saw her and her husband at their beige-carpeted apartment on Central Park West a few months later. While she was busy dreaming up paths to progress, her government had created another obstacle—a proposed new tax on health-care diagnostics—and Mazumdar-Shaw was furious. “They’re saying we will only levy this tax on air-conditioned hospitals,” she said. “And I’m saying to these idiots, ‘Diagnostic instruments have to be in air-conditioned rooms! So what are you talking about?’ ” She wasn’t yelling, but it seemed as if she might like to be. “If you add ten per cent to the cost, who’s going to pay is the patient! Who is the bloody jackass who has gone and made this tax? The finance minister—he needs his head examined.” Mazumdar-Shaw had just attended a conference in Boston with the M.I.T. Leadership Council and the Tea Party activist David Koch, a cancer survivor, who had funded a research center there. “Quite the character,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. “He reminded me so much of our . . . of any politician anywhere in the world.” The Indian government was withholding approval on a plan she had at her own cancer center, to use a bit of adjacent public land for a community garden for the visiting families of poor patients. “Inertia,” John Shaw said, bringing his wife a glass of white wine before they sat down for a lunch prepared by their chef, Ramesh, who had travelled with them from Bangalore on their frequent-flier miles. “India’s a great place for all kinds of specious regulation to make money.” There had been other recent disappointments, too. The latest round of trials on oral insulin had not gone as well as hoped. “The placebo effect was very high,” Mazumdar-Shaw said, and shrugged. “Unfortunately, the patients going on placebo, they changed their life style—they want to look good for their doctors.” Suddenly, their control group of diabetics had started exercising and eating better. “We had inadvertently unblinded the trial.” Mazumdar-Shaw did not seem particularly discouraged, though; the game-changing would just take a little longer. “I always tell people success is about going from failure to failure without giving up,” she had told me, paraphrasing Winston Churchill. “In school, I used to love Ayn Rand—these characters are doing such awesome things and they don’t mind fighting the whole world! I used to love stories of creative excellence, people doing things that are exceptional,” she said. “That’s why I wanted to be a brewmaster.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

The Political Scene: Barney’s Frank Opinions,23846,"[#image: /photos/590954dc1c7a8e33fb38b3a6] “Well, I think he’s going to get the nomination,” Congressman Barney Frank said of Newt Gingrich, in this week’s Political Scene podcast, with Ryan Lizza and George Packer. “I don’t think we’ve had a time in American history when the dominant wing of a political party was so out of sync with everybody else,” Frank, who recently announced that he would not be seeking another term, said. “It’s interesting that [Gingrich] and Romney are accusing each other of flip-flopping,” Frank told Packer and Lizza. “Between the two of them they could power a small-sized city with their gyrations. He has, unlike Romney, a nastiness to it, a willingness to be critical. I think Newt Gingrich, he is a very clever—as opposed to intelligent, I would say—guy for political strategy.” A Gingrich candidacy would be great for Obama, in Frank’s view. “This man became Speaker in 1995, and less than four years later had to quit. He cannot run things, at least based on the evidence we’ve seen.” Gingrich, Frank went on, “is a man of no public-policy commitments. He talked more about having ideas than about the ideas.” Gingrich’s explanation of his work for Freddie Mac was, Frank said, “gobbledygook.” Elsewhere in the conversation, the Congressman said that, with the Dodd-Frank financial bill, “if a large institution is failing, it fails…. There are death panels in the legislation we passed in the previous Congress, but not, as Sarah Palin mistakenly said, in the health bill. It’s in the financial-reform bill.” Frank saw less sense in Occupy Wall Street: “I don’t understand why some people think that simply being in a physical place does much.” Frank suggests that the O.W.S. protesters may enjoy cheering each other on more than engaging with problems, and asked why there were no voter-registration tables or campaigns to contact representatives. Packer said that, based on his visits to Zuccotti Park, many protesters don’t believe the political process works. Frank replied, “That’s just stupid…. What works better? Standing in a park? How does that help?” Frank plans to help, even in retirement, by working on issues he cares about from outside Congress. He said that he thought his words might have more meaning if spoken from beyond the Beltway. “There’s such cynicism now, that I’ll be saying pretty much the same things but with more credibility.” A transcript of the podcast is below.

The Political Scene, December 9th, 2011 LIZZA: This is the Political Scene, a weekly conversation with New Yorker writers and editors about politics. It’s Friday, December 9th I’m Ryan Lizza… VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Young Child Tells Their Mother ""I'm Not a Girl"" PACKER: … and I’m George Packer. Last month, congressman Barney Frank announced he would not be running for reelection next year and he used the occasion to talk about the dysfunction in Washington. CLIP—FRANK: The leverage you have within government has substantially diminished. The anger in the country, the currents of opinion are such, so that the kind of inside work I have felt best at is not gonna be as productive for the foreseeable future and not until we make some changes. LIZZA: Barney Frank joins us from his office in Newton, Massachusetts. Welcome to the Political Scene, Congressman. FRANK: Thank you. LIZZA: You’re retiring from the Congress, but in your announcement, you implied that you would continue to fight for the issues you care about from the outside. What have you got in mind once you leave Congress? FRANK: A lot of media work. I do some now, but I’ll be doing even more. Ironically, one of the things I think is going to happen is that, there’s such cynicism now about elected officials that I’ll be saying pretty much the same things on substance that I’ve been saying before, but with more credibility. I won’t have people discounting what I say through some screen that they set up for anybody who’s in elected office. I want to do some writing, both some longer work and some shorter pieces and do a lot of lecturing, a lot of speaking, a lot of campaigning for other people. LIZZA: So you’re going from being a politician to a member of the media. Do you think that’s going to enhance your credibility in terms of the respect that the public has for those two professions? FRANK: Yes in this sense—I’m not going to be working for any entity or institution. There’s a kinda general skepticism, I agree, about institutions. When I try to talk substance with a lot of people in the media I get very frustrated because they don’t want to talk substance; they don’t want to talk about public policy. They want: “Who do you think’s going to win? And what do you think the political implications are of that? And if that were to happen, who would gain and who would lose?” What I’ve tried to say to them is, “You’re the handicapper not me. My job is to try to influence public policy, not make these kind of predictions.” So I do think once I’m not myself a candidate that will, if not disappear, it will diminish. PACKER: So congressman, you’re leaving partly because of dysfunction in Washington. You’ve been there a little over thirty years: talk to us about the main reasons, historically, that it has reached this nadir in the year 2011. FRANK: Well, it begins in a very clear way, and this is, I guess, politically relevant, with Newt Gingrich. Newt Gingrich got to Washington and was dismayed at the level of partisan civility and cooperation. I’m not putting these words in his mouth. People can go back and check and he said, “We must refute the notion that these disagreements along party lines are between people of good will. The Democrats,” he said, “are corrupt. They are treasonous and disloyal. They are immoral.” Gingrich became the minority leader and said, “Look, we’re not gonna win back the House unless we show the Democrats are bad people.” That succeeded. Well, success breeds imitation, so the Democrats began to fight back. But then it’s been increased lately by a couple of factors. First of all, it is the reality. Someone asked, I think it was Harold Macmillan, when he was retiring as Prime Minister of England, what were the most influential factors in what happened to politicians. And he said, “Events, dear boy, events.” It was, ironically, what I find is the most conservative elements of this country are benefiting politically from the terrible economic crisis that was more a result of their public policy choices than anybody else’s. Namely, the complete non-regulation and deregulation of these new financial entities, which led to this most serious economic problem in more than sixty years. That caused people to get very angry at government and we, the Democrats, are seen as the party of government. Another frustration is that when the government does badly, even if it’s the Republicans who do it, in many ways we the Democrats suffer more because confidence gets lost in government. So there was that reaction to the reality. And then finally—and this is a serious factor—it’s the evolution of the media. Twenty years ago people were still getting their basic information from a common set of sources. What we now have is the most active people in the country on the Left and the Right living in parallel media universes. Again, the most active people in the country know different things, and because each one tends to hear mostly and deal mostly with people with whom they agree, they are reinforced not simply in the conviction that they are right, which is totally appropriate, but that they are the majority. So you have both sides, the Left and the Right, thinking that the majority of the country is really with them. So when some of us try to accomplish some things taking into account maybe, no, on this one we don’t have the majority, people get angry at us and I had people telling me two years ago, “Why don’t you get single-payer healthcare?”—which I support—“everyone I know is for it.” Well, they didn’t know a whole lot of people who weren’t for it, so that anger feeds in as well. LIZZA: This trend that you’re talking about has been decades in the making, right? I mean you trace it to Gingrich, I think that’s correct, but for decades now polarization has increased, partisanship has increased, there’s some evidence that people are physically moving into more ideologically homogenous areas of the country, that the whole country is sorting and polarizing. So Barack Obama, who’s a pretty smart guy, and studied politics closely—what did he miss about this? Did he not understand the nature of the last few decades of what’s been going on? FRANK: I think that’s true. I remember a point at which I realized that he was underestimating this when he said in 2008, in the campaign, that he was going to govern in a post-partisan manner. Now, knowing what I knew, I told one of his staffers he was giving me post-partisan depression, because I was afraid he would be engaged in a lot of unilateral gestures that wouldn’t get anywhere and I think that’s very much what happened. PACKER: In other words, partisanship is the problem but wishing for post-partisanship is not the answer? FRANK: Excessive partisanship is the problem. There has never been a democracy in the history of the world in a polity of any size where you didn’t have political parties. Even sometimes over the objections of the people who started it. The people who started the American government, the founders of the Constitution, didn’t like political parties but they were forced to start them. Nobody ever created political parties in England, they evolved. And there do tend to be two general tendencies that focus around how much government you think you need. In the West everybody recognizes the need for a private sector, pretty much, even the one Socialist group understands this now, and so there tends to be debate about how much public sector intervention you think is needed for a variety of reasons, and there are very important differences on party lines that should be fought out. The problem is when bitterness steps in, so that the fact that people differ on some legitimate issue on partisan lines, then makes it hard for them to cooperate in other ways and that’s what Obama did not understand. He came to office after a period of extraordinary bipartisan cooperation. I was chairman of the Financial Services Committee—I’m a partisan Democrat, here’s the Bush administration—and beginning in 2008, we the Democrats were frankly working better with the Bush administration than many of their Republican so-called allies in the Congress. The problem was that the bipartisan cooperation we were able to have with the financial people in the Bush administration obviously had no carry-over to the Republicans in the House and the Senate. PACKER: Well just to prove that the media aren’t entirely without substance, I’m going to ask you a bit about policy here and I think Ryan is, too. The first question about policy has to do with housing, which was at the root of the financial crisis—the collapse in housing prices, the sub-prime crisis that led to securitization, bad mortgages that led to a global financial crisis. It’s still in crisis. Housing prices are still depressed, foreclosure is still epidemic. What have the administration and Congress not been able to do more about this root cause of our financial troubles? FRANK: Well it’s the central question. There are two explanations. First of all, it was a problem of the transition; the transition from Bush to Obama. People are familiar with and have read about the Herbert Hoover-Franklin Roosevelt difficulties back then and they, in fact, amended the constitution to speed up the takeover by the new president by about six weeks, but it wasn’t enough. The TARP was passed, the response to the crisis, in October. By the time it was being administered by the Bush administration, Obama had won the election. And I had one difference with Henry Paulson, whom I admired—the Secretary of the Treasury under Bush—enormously, and that was, he was focused on only on getting the money to the banks and did not want to do anything to require them to deal with the foreclosure issue. I tried to get him to do it and finally it got to the point where he said, “I’m only going to do it if Obama’s going to do it.” Obama, understandably, said, “I’m not President yet. I’m can’t take responsibility.” At one point, President Obama said, “We only have one President at a time.” I was so frustrated that I said that overstated the number of Presidents we had at that time. And it fell in the cracks. We had authority that we could have used over the banks to compel them to do some things that Paulson wouldn’t use and Obama wasn’t ready to urge him to do it. So that’s the first reason: we didn’t use the authority when we had it. The second point is that trying to avert foreclosures, once you can’t just force the banks to do it as a condition of getting aid, means that you have to put some public money into it or you have to do other things that are politically unpopular. From the macroeconomic standpoint there is overwhelming need to help people reduce what they owe so that we don’t get the foreclosures and we don’t get people kicked out of their homes. On the other hand, there is great resistance politically to helping people, not all of whom would be worth recipients of the help. And what we were trying to say is, “Look, we’ll have to accept the fact that some people who are not all that deserving are going to help, because otherwise we all go under.” That’s why we haven’t done more. I’m at the point now where I think the President has to step up and say, “Look, the macroeconomic damage that is happening is still there.” The economy otherwise is doing well, particularly in the face of what’s going on in Europe. Our economy is on the verge of a turnaround. If we could just have people be persuaded that we know what we’re doing on the mortgages, then I’d be very optimistic, even in the near term. LIZZA: There’s a critique of the first couple of years of the Obama Administration that maybe he took his eyes off of the most pressing concern out there. Bill Galston has written about the “agenda of necessity” and the “agenda of choice,” right? The agenda that Obama campaigned on, but then, perhaps, the agenda that was more important once the financial crisis hit. Do you think, that maybe he took his eye of the ball on the economy? Do you think that moving to healthcare and moving to some of the other issues he moved to… FRANK: No. And I’ve got to say, I talked about the media: why is the focus always on the negative? In fact, a lot of good things happened. And I’ll tell you this is one of my concerns about the media, which you are exemplifying: “Let’s talk about all the things he didn’t do.” His first bill wasn’t healthcare; the first thing he did was an economic stimulus program. And he pushed hard and had a compromise with the Republicans and got it through over a filibuster. I don’t think that’s taking your eye off the ball. LIZZA: Let’s talk a little bit about President Obama’s speech this week in Kansas. Let’s listen to a section where he goes specifically after Republicans. OBAMA—CLIP: After all that’s happened, after the worst economic crisis, the worst financial crisis, since the Great Depression, they want to return to the same practices that got us into this mess. In fact, they want to go back to the same policies that stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way too many years. And their philosophy is simple: “We are better off when everyone’s left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.” LIZZA: Now that’s Obama this week—a much different Obama than the one in 2009 and 2010, who really shied away from that kind of partisan language and, I think, some people would say, shied away from defending the ideology of his party. What do you think explains the change, Congressman Frank? FRANK: It’s a rhetorical change, but you’re wrong to say that he wasn’t defending the ideology. What he was talking about, now, was defending the legislation we passed last year on financial reform, when he talked about going back to the old ways. In fact the Republicans are, incredibly to me, trying to re-deregulate derivatives. I would have thought if there was one thing that would get consensus, it was that the kind of things that A.I.G. did were really just a disaster. But they are pushing hard to re-deregulate derivatives. So when you talk about Obama, what he was doing in the passage you just referred to, was defending out accomplishments of the last year. PACKER: What effect is Occupy Wall Street having in Washington, if any? FRANK: Unfortunately not nearly as much as I wish it would have and it’s becoming somewhat negative. I don’t understand why people think that simply being in a physical place does much. I have a rule that I have tried to propagate among my friends on the Left. If you care deeply about a cause and you are then engaged on behalf of that cause in an activity that makes you feel very good and very brave and you’re really in solidarity with all your friends, and you’re enjoying it, you’re probably not advancing the cause very much, because you’re spending all your time with people you agree with cheering each other on and not engaging. I’ve seen a lot of things about Occupy Wall Street, I haven’t noticed any voter registration tables. I haven’t seen people saying, “Send your Representatives and Senators an e-mail saying, ‘Confirm a director, or don’t deregulate, or pass the millionaires tax.’” PACKER: But that’s because a lot of them, I’ve been down there quite a bit and have asked that very question, and a lot of them them say, “That doesn’t work. It hasn’t worked for thirty years, we’ve seen these trends for thirty years and it hasn’t worked. That’s a fundamental problem.” FRANK: I know I get accused of being rude, that’s just stupid. What do you mean it either worked or didn’t work? Have we had no gains? No elections have ever been won? Nothing good has happened? That’s simply not true: it’s more or less. And what works better? Standing in a park? How does that help? So what you’re telling me is, their answer is: “We’re not going to try to influence the political process. We’re not going to try to elect people who agree with us. We’re not going to try to get people who are in office to adopt good public policies.” Well that’s a confession of defeat. If you announce that you’re not going to participate in the political process, then when you ask what impact it’s having on the Congress, I guess the answer is obvious. In general, I would think that if you are a vegetarian and you write an essay about what you like to eat, very few butchers are going to read it. LIZZA: So, Newt Gingrich, you’ve known him a long time, you guys got to the House within just a few years of each other. You’ve been cheering him on in the Republican primaries, you think he would be the best person for Obama to run against. We talked a little bit about him before and how he changed the institution, but you know him personally. What can you tell us about Newt Gingrich that… BF: That he is a man of no public policy commitments… LIZZA: So you don’t buy the Newt as an intellectual, you don’t buy the Newt as a smart, wonky intellectual? You don’t have that view of him? FRANK: No, I think in my experience, he’s talked more about having ideas than the ideas. Literally, he would talk about ideas. I cannot identify him with any great public policy initiatives. By the way, when he was in the House, his committee was Public Works. He was never one who was articulating policy. He was a great political strategist and tactician and he did engineer the Republican takeover by understanding that if you got very nasty and negative and did it in a focused way, you can get very negative and have some games. He has literally been all over the lot on public policy. And so it’s interesting that he and Romney are accusing each other of flip-flopping. Between the two of them they could power a small-sized city with their gyrations. But he has, unlike Romney, a nastiness to it, a willingness to be critical. I think Newt Gingrich, he is a very clever—as opposed to intelligent, I would say—guy for political strategy. As for his intellectual thing, when he was trying to defend himself when he got caught as a lobbyist for Freddie Mac, he said well he was talking about the transcontinental railroad as a model for DSEs. That’s just gobbledygook. That’s just trying to show off some knowledge when it’s got no relevance to anything. LIZZA: Having watched him up close, and having watching him sort of implode in the ’90s, to put your political handicapper hat on, would you… FRANK: Oh, I think he’s going to get the nomination, for a variety of reasons. I think it’s a confirmation of how the Republican primary electorate, whether it’s ten, fifteen per cent of the country, is so sharply differentiated from the rest of the country. I don’t think we’ve had a time in American history when the dominant wing of a political party was so out of sync with everybody else. The Democrats approached that, unfortunately, with the McGovern people, Nixon helped maneuver that, but in fact, substantively, I think that the Republican electorate is even further away from there. And by the way, yes, he did become Speaker, remember, this man became Speaker in 1995 and less than four years later, he had to quit. I mean, he cannot run things based, at least based on the evidence we’ve seen. LIZZA: But, Congressman Frank, just one question on that. In between ,say, shutting down the government and impeaching Bill Clinton, there was a sort of fruitful working relationship there with the White House, where some stuff got done, no? FRANK: There was some, well, in one or two areas. It was under Gingrich’s Speakership, by the way, that they did the Defense of Marriage Act to try and demagogue. But yeah, we did get welfare reform done. But it was, I think, less him than some of the Republicans in the Senate. This was the time when you had some more constructive Republicans in the Senate. He was not directly involved in this, but we did finally get to a budget balance by the way, that is true. But I do want to make a substantive point about that. The last time we got budget balance was the deal between Clinton and the Congressional Republicans, and it had three legs to the stool. Military spending reductions, taxes on the wealthiest—at that point, the wealthiest began at 150,000, a lower number than we would pick today, significantly. And domestic spending cuts. So there’s right-wing insistence that we’re going to do the stool with only one leg. I guess we turn the stool into a shooting stick. You really can’t balance on a shooting stick. LIZZA: Congressman Barney Frank, thanks so much. FRANK: You’re welcome. Thank you guys. PACKER: This has been the Political Scene from The New Yorker. I’m George Packer. LIZZA: And I’m Ryan Lizza.

Ask the Author Live: Hendrik Hertzberg on Newt Gingrich,9368,"In this week’s Comment, Hendrik Hertzberg writes about Newt Gingrich. On Tuesday, Hertzberg answered readers’ questions in a live chat. Read a transcript of their discussion below. HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Elvis is not in the building, and neither is Newt, but I’m here. We’ll start the discussion in a couple of minutes. QUESTION FROM 10010: A lot of Democrats seem to think Gingrich would be a far weaker general-election candidate than Romney. (Barney Frank: “I did not think I had lived a good enough life to be rewarded by Newt Gingrich being the Republican nominee.”) Do you agree? Should Dems be rooting for Newt? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Hi again, all. I agree with a lot of Democrats. Newt would be much weaker, because while Romney is just annoyingly bland, Newt is unbearably annoying. He can control his temper, as he showed in that last debate, but he can’t control his temperament. But Democrats shouldn’t be rooting for him, because Democrats are Americans. There’s always the chance that the Republican nominee will win. QUESTION FROM CHARLIE: did you actually read these trilogies of “torture”? because subjecting yourself to this election cycle is sadistic enough HENDRIK HERTZBERG: I took a dip. Kind of like those New Year’s Day swims in icy waters, where you plunge in and plunge out, real quick. The debates are always significant. Personally, I wish that Obama would accept Newt’s challenge to have seven very long (three-hour) one-on-one debates with no moderators or not much. It won’t happen. McCain made a similar challenge last time and Obama didn’t take him up on it. I actually don’t think it would be a risk. By the way, Reagan had a lot of baggage, too: he had spent his life till past 50 dressing up in costumes and pretending to be cowboys and such. One of his movies was Bedtime for Bonzo. He was a right-winger who wanted to privatize (i.e., abolish) social security. He was not only divorced (which no President ever had been before), he was divorced from an Oscar-winning movie star. He had orange hair. Compared to that, Newt’s baggage is just carry-on. (I exaggerate, of course.) QUESTION FROM BRUCE: Please don’t make us imagine that. Please! Do you think Gingrich believes the bilge he spews or his he just another PT Barnum on the Political Midway? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Newt is a weird combination of innocent and cynical. I think he believes everything his says *at the moment he says it.* The next day, when he says the opposite, he believes that, too. He is a better actor than Reagan (who in any case was essentially an announcer, not an actor) because he internalizes the conviction for the performance. He is a Stanislavsky politician. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? QUESTION FROM BMADOFF: Like me Newt is a sociopath. Of course, his mea culpa sounds reasonable and sincere; that’s what con artists excell in. All my friends trusted me with their life savings…should the American People trust Newt with their country? I dont’ think so. HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Yo, Bernie. Let’s just hope your hypothesis doesn’t get tested. QUESTION FROM CAITLIN: Why do you think Republicans are so forgiving of his affairs, considering what happened to Cain? Have they forgotten, or is it just old news? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: If it turns out he is cheating on Calista or has cheated on her, he’ll be toast. But I would bet, oh, ten thousand dollars that he isn’t and hasn’t. QUESTION FROM JANINE: his appeal is due to “audiences shaped and coarsened by years of listening to talk radio and watching Fox News” anything more you can add to this? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Not just his appeal. Bachmann’s and Cain’s, too. The closed mental world created by Limbaugh and his imitators and Fox News (especially Hannity, O’Reilly, and the morning crew, marks a sea change in American politics. It’s like a little totalitarian state within the state. QUESTION FROM CJD: Don’t you think it is galling that he is already naming his Secretary of State and proposing debates and not one vote has been cast? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: What’s worse is who he named as his Secretary of State: John Bolton, the mustachioed warmonger. QUESTION FROM PAGE: The language talking points are common to all, Sen Schumer on the phone and forgetting there were journalists present, telling Democratic Senators how to describe Republican budget cuts: “I always use extreme,that is what the caucus instructed me to use.” HENDRIK HERTZBERG: “Extreme” is at least arguably accurate. I don’t especially like it as a term of abuse, because extreme is not always bad. But it’s a far cry from “sick” and “traitors.” QUESTION FROM GUEST: True about Reagan, but Reagan ran before Newt devised the politics of personal destruction. how will Newt deploy the politics of personal destruction against obama that has not already been done? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Obama doesn’t offer a lot to work with on the politics of personal destruction front. Anyway, Newt has been more about the politics of vituperation. But he has another side, a longing for being taken seriously as an “intellectual,” which could be an entry point for Obama to “seduce” him as, in a different way, Clinton seduced him. The Republican campaign is going to be very ugly, but the heavy ugliness lifting will be conducted by the “independent” SuperPacs like Rove’s American Crossroads, etc. QUESTION FROM GUEST: so what is with this field? why can’t they manage to find a candidate who is even remotely plausible? don’t get me wrong, as a Dem I find the whole thing very funny, but it is also tremendously depressing. HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Well, if I’m reading your meaning of “plausible” correctly, Romney is certainly plausible. The most plausible of the lot is Huntsman, but for various reasons he does not offer “the base” the kind of emotional satisfaction that seems to be required. QUESTION FROM NEAL: Mormons and Evangelicals are the most successful engines of religious conversion in America. How much of the Southern hostility towards Romney is driven by religious tribalism and Evangelical resentment of their religious competition? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: That’s such an interesting question. Mormons do their converting door to door via clean-cut teenage and twenty-something “elders.” There are no Mormon Jimmy Swaggerts. There’s no operatic excess, no bathos about sin and forgiveness. Their theology may be weird, but they come across as the ultimate in upper-middle-class respectability. It can look like smugness. I suspect that that has more to do with the hostility than the stuff about the golden plates in upstate New York and all that. QUESTION FROM PHIL: How is it the Republican party can convince the middle class that republican policies of tax breaks for the rich, voucher healthcare, 9-9-9 etc. are best for them when they clearly are not? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: They can’t. They can’t convince them of that. But Obama and the Democrats will have to convince them of the opposite, which will be a challenge. It involves a process of reasoning. It requires following a series of quasi-speculative arguments. The G.O.P. has an easier task. The country is suffering, Obama is the president of the country, get rid of Obama. QUESTION FROM JOHN K. WILSON : it’s remarkable to me (as someone who wrote a book about Newt in 1996; see newtcrimes.info) that so little attention is paid in the media to Newt’s past scandals and outrageous comments. But it shocked me in 2007 that Hillary Clinton got a pass on her scandals as “old news” while the media was obsessed with Obama’s non-scandals of guilt by association with Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright. However, I believed that in a general election, these old scandals would finally be investigated by the press. Am I naïve? Will Newt ever get scrutiny for anything other than a few of his sex scandals that he’s already confessed to? HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Way to sneak in that commercial! But, yes, I do think that there will be a lot of scrutiny of Newt. Younger voters don’t seem to like him much as it is, and they’re the ones to whom the rich details will come as news. But Obama has lost a lot of ground with the young—mostly unfairly, in my opinion, but there it is. QUESTION FROM VANESSA: but neither, it seems, does Romney. No one seems to care about him at all. (I do, because the man once tied his dog to the roof, which ought to eliminate him right there). But otherwise, it seems that the base likes the real whackjobs, and I cannot imagine that the average American will vote for any of them. HENDRIK HERTZBERG: I was hoping we’d get to the dog on the roof. Gail Collins rules! As good a note as any to close on. Thanks, people.

Wall Street Protests: Signs of the Times,7159,"Wednesday evening, I stood outside the Tweed Courthouse on Chambers Street for almost two hours watching people stream by in one of the biggest protest marches I have seen in this town, and I’ve been here a while. Some were union members who had joined the young Occupy Wall Street activists camped out in Zuccotti Park; others were students from colleges around the city; many were individuals present on their own account. (I wrote about what Keynes would have made of the protests earlier this week.) Lots of the protesters were carrying homemade signs conveying their feelings. Some of the signs were funny. Some were predictable. Some were downright bizarre. I noted down as many as I could, thinking I would try and pick out the most memorable. Here they are, roughly in the order I saw them. (As I write this, there are reports of sporadic trouble in the Wall Street area after the main march had finished. I didn’t see any of that. From where I stood, the protest was good-natured and peaceful—festive, almost. But clearly, there is a tension within the movement between a minority that wants to confront the police and those who simply want to make their point. More on that anon. But first, the signs.)

Politics in Another Egypt,6208,"One evening last week, I drove out of Cairo into the Delta—never a happy proposition; the roads and the traffic are terrible and thirty-five miles can be three hours of crawl, honking, and swerving between tractors, crammed minibuses, trucks overloaded with bricks, wood, stoves, careening motorbikes, and donkey carts. Obstacles like that keep journalists, and many Egyptians, in the capital, and foster the impression that that all of politics happens within a few blocks of Tahrir Square. I arrived after dark in Menya El Qamh, a Delta town of half-finished red brick buildings, where Abdel-Moneim Aboul el-Fotouh, who is running for President, was due to speak. Fotouh was, until recently, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was expelled for violating the Brotherhood’s stated policy against fielding candidates. (I wrote about Fotouh, and the tensions within the revolution, in The New Yorker this summer.) There was trash heaped along the banks of an irrigation canal, and men sat outside, passing the time with a glass of tea. “Most of the people here are from the farming class,” Mohamed Fathy Hanafi, a young graphic designer, told me. His family foundation, the Al Hanafi Organization for Society and Development, has, over the past few months, invited Presidential candidates to come and speak to the town. “There’s much stronger political awareness since the revolution,” Hanafi said. “People are thinking about the direction of the country, how SCAF”—the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces—”will deliver their promises to hand over to a civilian authority.” He told me the Muslim Brotherhood was strong here: they had provided social services for many years. The old nationalist Wafd Party also had an office, but the new liberal parties had not yet made any effort to create a presence. We took our seats in a brightly colored open-air tent, the kind used for weddings and funerals, by the side of the road. Perhaps two or three hundred people had come to listen. A local kid rapped anti-Mubarak lyrics to the tune of “Gangsta’s Paradise.” Mohamed Saad, a middle-aged man in a grey gallabaya who had come with several of his friends, told me that he liked the Brotherhood, but he was not with them. He had been an official in the Transport Ministry, he told me, retired two years ago. “So why are the roads so bad?” “It is the political decisions and they way they are made.” Fotouh began to speak. “Egypt is a big beautiful ship carrying all of us, Muslims, Christians, with all of our opinions, towards elections,” he said. He talked about freedom and justice; he was against corruption, in favor of strong institutions, independent judiciary, free healthcare, decent education, democratic pluralism, political awareness and participation, vote and choice. He is a vigorous politician with a grandfatherly sort of charisma. Strikingly, both moderate Islamist friends and those on the whiskey-drinking end of the liberal spectrum have told me they would consider voting for Fotouh. Afterwards there were questions. Fotouh was asked about the storming of the Israeli Embassy, and whether the Camp David Accords be renegotiated. He called Netanyahu a “Zionist criminal,” while urging some caution. “Do you think this is the only time this has ever happened?” he said, referring to the Israeli killing of five Egyptian soldiers during the confusion of a raid across the Sinai border by Palestinian militants in August, which had angered many Egyptians. “There are international procedures.” He pointed to Turkey, which had waited for a U.N. report on the killing, by Israeli forces, of Turkish activists on a ship that was trying to break the blockade of Gaza, before downgrading diplomatic relations. As for Camp David, it was much more important to build Egypt up first, Fotouh said; the best thing to do was to project strength, so that war could be avoided. He was asked whether the Muslim Brotherhood would really support democracy. If people didn’t like them, he said, they could chose to vote the Brotherhoods candidates out. The people were the power now, as the revolution had proved. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist The proceedings were polite, the questions pertinent, the discourse intelligent. It looked and felt like a normal part of a democratic process. Afterward, I talked to those who had attended, and they had a ready amount of skepticism. “I am not so comfortable with him,’ a young petroleum engineer in a red-and-white checked shirt told me. “He’s old and he was in the Muslim Brotherhood.” “He’s a good man,” another man, in a white dishdasha, said. “But I am campaigning for another Islamist candidate!” “Even though I am a Brotherhood guy,” a man in a shirt and tie said, “I am looking at the reform program, not if a candidate is Islamic or not.’ A Muslim Brotherhood member standing nearby disagreed: “I have another point of view!” Fotouh’s media adviser, a young fast-talking former journalist who had given up his job to volunteer on the campaign, told me that Fotouh is trying to stand apart from the liberal-Islamist divide. Whether that means he can capture the middle ground or just gets lost between remains to be seen. The parliamentary election date has now been set for November 21st, but Presidential elections could be more than a year off. And a new constitution is still to be written. And, outside of Cairo, a battle for the hearts and votes of the majority of the Egyptian electorate—the culturally conservative, socially concerned, middle and lower middle class—is just getting started.

"Cairo’s Long, Hot Ramadan",4873,"It is August and hot, in last days of Ramadan, and Cairo sighs and sleeps through the afternoons. The city is enjoying a hiatus from protests. At the end of July, the big Tahrir Square sit-in was drawn down voluntarily by activists groups; military police and central security then forcibly cleared out the remaining protestors, tearing down tents amid running rock battles, and arresting dozens. A protest outside the Israeli Embassy—which began after two Egyptian soldiers were killed ten days ago during a confused attack by Palestinian militants wearing Egyptian army uniforms, just over the Sinai border—is winding down, too. As activism seems to fade, politics is taking its place. Parliamentary elections are expected—although the date hasn’t yet been announced—sometime in the fall. Blocs and coalitions and alliances are forming. A few friends active in the leftish-liberal Egyptian Social Democratic Party came over last week for a drink, and debated whether to join forces with the Free Egyptians, run by Naguib Sawiris, a billionaire Christian businessman (he is seen as a political liability; avowedly secular in a conservative country and prone to gaffes), or with the Adl, or Justice Party, which strives to be a bridge between liberal and religiously conservative constituencies. “One of the Adl guys told me they’re gambling,” a friend told me. He is a member the Foreign Affairs committee of the E.S.D.P., and a gynecologist. “Either they will pick up the majority in the middle or they will fall between two stools.” The parliamentary elections will involve a mash-up of proportional representation, party lists, and first-past-the-post; it is so complicated that, voters will apparently be faced with four separate ballot sheets. It is impossible to know what the resulting legislature will look like. Broadly speaking, amid myriad new parties, there are two emergent blocs: the Islamists, centered around the Muslim Brotherhood; and the liberals. But the old networks of patronage, the influence of prominent political families, and remnants of Mubarak’s now disbanded National Democratic Party, may prove difficult to break at the ballot box. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist The Egyptian political landscape is still raw and unformed democratic clay. The great welter and cacophony, I suspect, is likely to continue for some time. In some ways, this is all part of the process—but increasingly I have a sense that the messy foreground is really a distraction from the bigger issues: the constitution, the role of the military establishment, and who a new President might be and what he might do. I had a few friends over for dinner on Friday. A blogger, known as Big Pharaoh, was a little despondent. Like everyone else, he had been watching the pictures from Tripoli all week. “The Libyans are having a real revolution. We haven’t finished ours yet,” he said. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or scaf, a body of officers appointed by Mubarak, is still running the country. Hisham Kassem, an independent newspaper editor, cautioned that it would be five or ten years before the military establishment could begin to be scaled back. “It all depends on the next President: does he want to have a confrontation with the Army, or does he want to address the priorities of poverty and healthcare and education?” One thing will have fundamentally changed: the next president is unlikely to be a military man. So everything depends on the constitution, and where the balance of power lies. That’s the battleground now. The plan so far, drawn up by scaf, is for the new parliament to elect a committee to write up a new constitution. But there has been an ongoing effort over the past weeks to create some kind of pre-baked template constitution to present to this commission. Hisham didn’t think a constitution would make much difference to the military establishment. “It will take years before the military becomes accountable to a civilian president,” he said. Egypt is grappling with the very large question of what makes a democracy and what ensures it. Among the crowds on Tahrir I thought it was “the people.” Now that the protesters are gone for the moment, I find myself not so sure.

Ask the Author Live: Ryan Lizza on Mitt Romney and Health Care,11531,"This week in the magazine, Ryan Lizza writes about Mitt Romney and health-care reform. (Subscribers can read the full text; others can buy access to the issue via the digital edition.) On Thursday, Lizza answered readers’ questions in a live chat. Read a transcript of the discussion below. RYAN LIZZA: Hi everyone. We have lots of questions, so let’s get started. QUESTION FROM DOUG: What would be the best course of action for Romney on this health care thing? Embrace it, completely denounce? RYAN LIZZA: I’m not great at giving political advice to candidates, but it does seem to me that Romney has two significant problems: one is ideological (health care/the mandate) and one is characterological (flip-flopper). Most of the attacks from his opponents so far, even when they are about the health care bill, attack him on character grounds. And if he had simply renounced his support for the mandate in Mass., it would have doomed him. He would be seen as standing for nothing. QUESTION FROM LOU: In light of McCain’s defeat in 2008 and the need for a strong GOP candidate, will concerns about Romney’s Mormonism among evangelical Republicans have tempered a bit, or do they seem to be as large an issue as last time? RYAN LIZZA: Breaking ethnic/religious/racial barriers usually takes a few cycles. I suspect that Mormonism will play less of a role this time around. For example, I wrote 5000 words about Romney and never even mentioned his religion. Similarly it is playing a minor part of most of the coverage this week of his official announcement. We’ll see what happens in Iowa among social conservatives though. QUESTION FROM SPENCER: What other ways has Romney the 2012 candidate changed from Romney the governor? RYAN LIZZA: It’s funny, in some sense Romney 2012 is a return to Governor Romney. He won election there on his record as a problem-solver at Bain and as the person who turned around the seemingly doomed Salt Lake City Olympics. In 2008, he moved hard to the right on social issues and sort of ditched the management consultant stuff. If his speech today is any indication, he will make the economy the central issue of his campaign and highlight his business background. QUESTION FROM RICHARD H.: Today Romney quoted your previous article about “leading from behind.” Do you think his critique of Obama’s foreign policy today was fair? RYAN LIZZA: Unlike a lot of other references to that quote, at least Romney made it clear it told to me in the context of Libya. Though, of course, like most conservatives who have used that line to beat up Obama, the larger context has been missing. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Leading from behind is about coercing others to do your bidding. It is Machiavellian, and is actually the opposite of what Romney and others think. QUESTION FROM JOAN S.: There seems to be a general malaise about the Republican presidential candidates. We’re all still waiting for someone to jump in? Any last minute additions you are keeping your eye out for? RYAN LIZZA: The malaise storyline happens almost every cycle. I remember covering the 2004 campaign and Democrats supposedly hated their field of candidates. Bill Clinton gave a speech about this at the Harkin Steak Fry, and he noted that people said that about him and his fellow contenders in 1992 as well. He said that what people really meant is that the candidates “just aren’t famous yet.” That’s what’s going on now. These guys just aren’t famous yet and they don’t look presidential. That will change a year or 18 months from now. QUESTION FROM RACHEL TRESS: What is the mood in Washington about Obama’s likelihood of reelection? Are Republicans optimistic? RYAN LIZZA: The mood changes every week! This week the mood is more negative because of the bad economic data. More negative about his reelection, that is… QUESTION FROM JIM: Does the Weiner story help Romney because he looks like a grown-up by comparison? RYAN LIZZA: I think the Weiner story makes almost everyone involved look bad, but especially the press. It’s one of those weeks when you are slightly embarrassed to be in the profession. QUESTION FROM MEGHAN: Is there any way Romney can get past this in a conservative time and in the primaries? RYAN LIZZA: I think he can. None of his competitors are perfect. Each one of them has had to navigate the same phenomenon: they were moderate-to-conservative governors who have watched as the party has shifted right over the last few years, rendering their former positions heretical. Pawlenty was a strong champion of cap and trade. And Huntsman has taken a number of stances at odds with conservatives. Granted, Romney’s dilemma is worse because his now-heretical idea became law in Mass. and was then used as the model for Obama, who is not very popular among Republicans. QUESTION FROM BOB LOBLAW: One point you mentioned obliquely in the article is the Gov. Romney had to get approval from the Bush administration for his plan—in order to get Medicaid reimbursement to shift from safety-net hospital supports to insurance subsidies. Can one say the Bush administration supported the individual mandate, too? RYAN LIZZA: That’s a great question. The Bush admin told Mass it would lose some hundreds of millions of dollars in federal money. Romney and Ted Kennedy responded by presenting the outline of their three-legged stool of a healthcare plan—subsidies, exchange, mandate—and arguing that if Bush kept the money flowing, they would use it to fund Romneycare. So I think you can indeed argue that the Bush admin favored the Romney plan, including the mandate. In fact, the Bush admin sent the Romney admin a congratulatory letter after the plan passed and confirmed that Mass would indeed get the money for the insurance subsidies. QUESTION FROM HENRY: How do you foresee Romney addressing his pro-choice record in MA? Although HC reform seems to be the driving issue at the moment, abortion will surely arise as a lightning rod in Iowa. RYAN LIZZA: This was a major issue for him in 2008. I suspect it will be less of an issue for him this time around because his change of heart is further in the past. But it will be part of the character issue that his opponents will use. QUESTION FROM MARIN: Did Romney get hit on his health-care record at all in 2008? Obviously its a bigger deal this time around… RYAN LIZZA: Interestingly, it was not a major issue in 2008. Remember, the individual mandate was a Republican idea, which had germinated in very conservative think tanks since 1990. It was only in early 2009, when libertarians, who were always against it, started convincing the rest of the conservative movement that this was an affront to liberty. Here’s Jim DeMint in 2007 endorsing Romney: he “has demonstrated… that he could work in a difficult partisan environment, take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured.” DeMint is the most conservative member of the US Senate and an idol to the Tea Party movement. QUESTION FROM RACHEL: Your article shows Romney instinctively supporting the mandate and Obama instinctively opposing it! Do you think Romney’s instincts on some issues are more liberal than Obama’s? RYAN LIZZA: Not sure about that, but what is so striking when you report out how the two men came to support the individual mandate, is that that they used the same logic and were convinced by the data rather than their ideological prejudices. And as I point out in the piece, they both had the same economist, Jonathan Gruber, running the numbers for them. QUESTION FROM GUEST: Do you think there is any chance that he could win? RYAN LIZZA: Of course he could. Don’t listen to anyone who says it’s over for him. And if Palin jumps in, he will be in an even stronger position, because the party elites, who hate her, will be desperate to find a safe alternative to her. QUESTION FROM PETER D.: You describe how the GOP has recently become more libertarian. If the economy improves and the GOP loses more elections on Medicare, might they discover the virtues of compassionate conservatism again? RYAN LIZZA: That seems likely. It’s ironic that in our system when the economy nosedives and most economists recommend an expansion of government spending to compensate for the output gap, the Republican party moves hard in the opposite direction. It usually takes a big loss for the pendulum to swing back the other way. For instance, Compassionate Conservatism, George W. Bush’s campaign message in 2000, was a direct response to the collapse of the Gingrich Republicans. QUESTION FROM FRANK: What do you make of Herman Cain? Will he flame out before he gets a New Yorker profile? RYAN LIZZA: Ha, I don’t know much about him. But he is showing movement in the polls, which has a lot of people taking him more seriously now. QUESTION FROM NED R.: Romney makes the point repeatedly that his plan was good for Massachusetts, but not federally. He seems right—they’ve covered 98% of the people; businesses, doctors support it, the exchange is working well. How can he honestly say a similar policy is bad for other states? RYAN LIZZA: I think he is absolutely correct that the main goal of the law in Mass.—expanding coverage—has been a success. His argument against the national law is about federalism: that the states should decide how to expand coverage on their own, not the federal government. I agree it’s difficult distinction to maintain, especially when most states have simply failed to do anything about expanding health insurance and also because the Obama plan is allowing a high degree of flexibility for individual states in implementing the new law. QUESTION FROM THEFONZ: Today is Mitt Romney more beatable in the Republican primaries or in a head to head with Obama? RYAN LIZZA: Tough one to answer. If the economy is not improving, Obama will be beatable by almost anyone who survives the GOP nominating contest. But I guess I think Romney is a better general election candidate than he is a primary candidate. His core strengths are better suited to the kind of campaign a Republican will have to run against Obama than the one he has to run against his GOP rivals. QUESTION FROM JON: Any rumblings of a third party candidate in this election? RYAN LIZZA: There are rumblings of a third party candidate every cycle. As many people have pointed out, the barriers to running a third party campaign are lower now because of the internet. A third party candidate can raise money faster and can organize more efficiently nowadays, which is crucial to overcome the ballot access issues that keep third party candidates from being real contenders. OK, I have to jump off. Thanks for all the great questions, and my apologies for the ones we didn’t get to. Feel free to continue the conversation on Twitter: @ryanlizza. Thanks again!

Cowboys and Pit Crews,15577,"This afternoon, Atul Gawande delivered this year’s commencement address at Harvard Medical School. In his book “The Youngest Science,” the great physician-writer Lewis Thomas described his internship at Boston City Hospital in pre-penicillin 1937. Hospital work, he observed, was mainly custodial. “If being in a hospital bed made a difference,” he said, “it was mostly the difference produced by warmth, shelter, and food, and attentive, friendly care, and the matchless skill of the nurses in providing these things. Whether you survived or not depended on the natural history of the disease itself. Medicine made little or no difference.” That didn’t stop the interns from being, as he put it, “frantically busy.” He learned to focus on diagnosis—insuring nothing was missed, especially an illness with an actual, effective treatment. There were only a few. Lobar pneumonia could be treated with antiserum, an injection of rabbit antibodies against the pneumococcus, if the intern identified the subtype correctly. Patients in diabetic coma responded dramatically to animal-extracted insulin and intravenous fluid. Acute heart failure patients could be saved by bleeding away a pint of blood from an arm vein, administering a leaf-preparation of digitalis, and delivering oxygen by tent. Early syphilitic paresis sometimes responded to a mix of mercury, bismuth, and arsenic. Surgery could treat certain tumors and infections. Beyond that, medical capabilities didn’t extend much further. The distance medicine has travelled in the couple of generations since is almost unfathomable for us today. We now have treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousand of diagnoses and conditions that afflict human beings. We have more than six thousand drugs and four thousand medical and surgical procedures, and you, the clinicians graduating today, will be legally permitted to provide them. Such capabilities cannot guarantee everyone a long and healthy life, but they can make it possible for most. People worldwide want and deserve the benefits of your capabilities. Many fear they will be denied them, however, whether because of cost, availability, or incompetence of caregivers. We are now witnessing a global societal struggle to assure universal delivery of our know-how. We in medicine, however, have been slow to grasp why this is such a struggle, or how the volume of discovery has changed our work and responsibilities. The rapid growth in medicine’s capacities is not just a difference in degree but a difference in kind. We have experienced the sort of vast, quantum alteration that my father describes experiencing during a life that brought him from childhood in rural India to retirement from a surgical practice in Ohio. The greatest leap for him, he tells me, wasn’t in taking that first step off the plane in New York City, extraordinary as that was. It was in going from his rural farming village of five thousand people to Nagpur, a city of millions where he was admitted to medical school, three hundred kilometers away. Both communities were impoverished. But the structure of life, the values, and the ideas were so different as to be unrecognizable. Visiting back home, he found that one generation couldn’t even grasp the other’s challenges. Here is where we seem to find ourselves, as well. We are at a cusp point in medical generations. The doctors of former generations lament what medicine has become. If they could start over, the surveys tell us, they wouldn’t choose the profession today. They recall a simpler past without insurance-company hassles, government regulations, malpractice litigation, not to mention nurses and doctors bearing tattoos and talking of wanting “balance” in their lives. These are not the cause of their unease, however. They are symptoms of a deeper condition—which is the reality that medicine’s complexity has exceeded our individual capabilities as doctors. The core structure of medicine—how health care is organized and practiced—emerged in an era when doctors could hold all the key information patients needed in their heads and manage everything required themselves. One needed only an ethic of hard work, a prescription pad, a secretary, and a hospital willing to serve as one’s workshop, loaning a bed and nurses for a patient’s convalescence, maybe an operating room with a few basic tools. We were craftsmen. We could set the fracture, spin the blood, plate the cultures, administer the antiserum. The nature of the knowledge lent itself to prizing autonomy, independence, and self-sufficiency among our highest values, and to designing medicine accordingly. But you can’t hold all the information in your head any longer, and you can’t master all the skills. No one person can work up a patient’s back pain, run the immunoassay, do the physical therapy, protocol the MRI, and direct the treatment of the unexpected cancer found growing in the spine. I don’t even know what it means to “protocol” the MRI. Before Elias Zerhouni became director of the National Institutes of Health, he was a senior hospital leader at Johns Hopkins, and he calculated how many clinical staff were involved in the care of their typical hospital patient—how many doctors, nurses, and so on. In 1970, he found, it was 2.5 full-time equivalents. By the end of the nineteen-nineties, it was more than fifteen. The number must be even larger today. Everyone has just a piece of patient care. We’re all specialists now—even primary-care doctors. A structure that prioritizes the independence of all those specialists will have enormous difficulty achieving great care. We don’t have to look far for evidence. Two million patients pick up infections in American hospitals, most because someone didn’t follow basic antiseptic precautions. Forty per cent of coronary-disease patients and sixty per cent of asthma patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care. And half of major surgical complications are avoidable with existing knowledge. It’s like no one’s in charge—because no one is. The public’s experience is that we have amazing clinicians and technologies but little consistent sense that they come together to provide an actual system of care, from start to finish, for people. We train, hire, and pay doctors to be cowboys. But it’s pit crews people need. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media Another sign this is the case is the unsustainable growth in the cost of health care. Medical performance tends to follow a bell curve, with a wide gap between the best and the worst results for a given condition, depending on where people go for care. The costs follow a bell curve, as well, varying for similar patients by thirty to fifty per cent. But the interesting thing is: the curves do not match. The places that get the best results are not the most expensive places. Indeed, many are among the least expensive. This means there is hope—for if the best results required the highest costs, then rationing care would be the only choice. Instead, however, we can look to the top performers—the positive deviants—to understand how to provide what society most needs: better care at lower cost. And the pattern seems to be that the places that function most like a system are most successful. By a system I mean that the diverse people actually work together to direct their specialized capabilities toward common goals for patients. They are coordinated by design. They are pit crews. To function this way, however, you must cultivate certain skills which are uncommon in practice and not often taught. For one, you must acquire an ability to recognize when you’ve succeeded and when you’ve failed for patients. People in effective systems become interested in data. They put effort and resources into collecting them, refining them, understanding what they say about their performance. Second, you must grow an ability to devise solutions for the system problems that data and experience uncover. When I was in medical school, for instance, one of the last ways I’d have imagined spending time in my future surgical career would have been working on things like checklists. Robots and surgical techniques, sure. Information technology, maybe. But checklists? They turn out, however, to be among the basic tools of the quality and productivity revolution in aviation, engineering, construction—in virtually every field combining high risk and complexity. Checklists seem lowly and simplistic, but they help fill in for the gaps in our brains and between our brains. They emphasize group precision in execution. And making them in medicine has forced us to define our key aims for our patients and to say exactly what we will do to achieve them. Making teams successful is more difficult than we knew. Even the simplest checklist forces us to grapple with vulnerabilities like handoffs and checklist overload. But designed well, the results can be extraordinary, allowing us to nearly eliminate many hospital infections, to cut deaths in surgery by as much as half globally, and to slash costs, as well. Which brings us to the third skill that you must have but haven’t been taught—the ability to implement at scale, the ability to get colleagues along the entire chain of care functioning like pit crews for patients. There is resistance, sometimes vehement resistance, to the efforts that make it possible. Partly, it is because the work is rooted in different values than the ones we’ve had. They include humility, an understanding that no matter who you are, how experienced or smart, you will fail. They include discipline, the belief that standardization, doing certain things the same way every time, can reduce your failures. And they include teamwork, the recognition that others can save you from failure, no matter who they are in the hierarchy. These values are the opposite of autonomy, independency, self-sufficiency. Many doctors fear the future will end daring, creativity, and the joys of thinking that medicine has had. But nothing says teams cannot be daring or creative or that your work with others will not require hard thinking and wise judgment. Success under conditions of complexity still demands these qualities. Resistance also surfaces because medicine is not structured for group work. Even just asking clinicians to make time to sit together and agree on plans for complex patients feels like an imposition. “I’m not paid for this!” people object, and it’s true right up to the highest levels. I spoke to a hospital executive the day after he’d presented to his board a plan to reorient his system around teams that focus on improving care outcomes, improving the health of the community, and lowering its costs of care. The meeting was contentious. The aims made sense, but hospital finances are not based on achieving them, and the board wasn’t sure about asking payers to change that. The meeting ended unresolved. These aims are not yet our aims in medicine, though we need them to be. Not long ago, I had an experience at our local school that brought home the stakes. I’d gone for a meeting with my children’s teachers, and I ran into the superintendent of schools. I told him how worried I was to see my kids’ art classes cut and their class sizes rise to almost thirty children in some cases. What was he working on to improve matters? I asked. “You know what I spend my time working on?” he said. “Health-care costs.” Teachers’ health-benefit expenses were up nine per cent, city tax revenues were flat, and school enrollment was up. A small percentage of teachers with serious illnesses accounted for the majority of the costs, and the only option he’d found was to cut their benefits. “Oh,” I said. I went to the teacher meetings. On the way, I ran into a teacher I had operated on. She’d had a lymphoma. She was one of that small percentage who accounted for most of the costs. That’s when it struck me. I was part of the reason my children didn’t have enough teachers. We all are in medicine. Reports show that every dollar added to school budgets over the past decade for smaller class sizes and better teacher pay was diverted to covering rising health-care costs. This is not inevitable. I do not believe society should be forced to choose between whether our children get a great education or their teachers get great medical care. But only we can create the local medical systems that make both possible. You who graduate today will join these systems as they are born, propel them, work on the policies that accelerate them, and create the innovations they need. Making systems work in health care—shifting from corralling cowboys to producing pit crews—is the great task of your and my generation of clinicians and scientists. You are the generation on the precipice of a transformation medicine has no choice but to undergo, the riders in the front car of the roller coaster clack-clack-clacking its way up to the drop. The revolution that remade how other fields handle complexity is coming to health care, and I think you sense it. I see this in the burst of students obtaining extra degrees in fields like public health, business administration, public policy, information technology, education, economics, engineering. Of some two hundred students graduating today, more than thirty-five are getting such degrees, intuiting that ordinary medical training wouldn’t prepare you for the world to come. Two years ago, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement started its Open School, offering free online courses in systems skills such as outcome measurement, quality improvement, implementation, and leadership. They hoped a few hundred medical students would enroll. Forty-five thousand did. You’ve recognized faster than any of us that the way we train, practice, and innovate has to change. Even the laboratory science must change—toward generating treatments and diagnostics that do not stand in isolation but fit in as reliable components of an integrated, economical, and effective package of care for the needs patients have. The problems of making health care work are large. The complexities are overwhelming governments, economies, and societies around the world. We have every indication, however, that where people in medicine combine their talents and efforts to design organized service to patients and local communities, extraordinary change can result. Recently, you might be interested to know, I met an actual cowboy. He described to me how cowboys do their job today, herding thousands of cattle. They have tightly organized teams, with everyone assigned specific positions and communicating with each other constantly. They have protocols and checklists for bad weather, emergencies, the inoculations they must dispense. Even the cowboys, it turns out, function like pit crews now. It may be time for us to join them.

Political Scene: Who Is Paul Ryan?,17919,"[#image: /photos/590954dc1c7a8e33fb38b3a6] “Who is Paul Ryan and how did he come to be the Republicans’ go-to guy on fiscal policy?” That’s the question Dorothy Wickenden poses on this week’s Political Scene podcast to Ryan Lizza. Lizza, referring to Ryan’s 2012 budget resolution that was released on Tuesday, offers two things that impress him about the young congressman from Wisconsin: One, he knows the details. He’s smart, and can go head-to-head with any of the policy wonks on the left over these programs, and that’s, frankly, rare among a lot of folks on the hill. And No. 2, he hasn’t shied away from presenting a pretty aggressive plan, even though he must know that the politics are very dangerous. And what about the budget proposal? Wickenden points to a piece on Slate by Jacob Weisberg that applauds Ryan’s plan for going “where Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich never did by terminating the entitlement status of Medicare and Medicaid.” Under Ryan’s proposal, those funds, which would be distributed through vouchers and block grants, respectively, would be capped at levels below the projected rate of health-care inflation. If the Republican party gets behind the proposal, Weisberg writes, “it will become for the first time in modern memory an intellectually serious party—one with a coherent vision to match its rhetoric of limited government.” James Surowiecki doesn’t give Ryan quite as much credit: Politically, at least, Ryan seems to be showing, at least to my mind, a little bit of a tin ear. One of the things that may happen if the Democrats play this correctly is that the two things will become associated in the public mind. So on the one hand you have this budget that can be spun as ending Medicare or crippling Medicaid, blah blah blah, and at the same time you have this government shutdown, were it to happen. To the extent that those two things become linked, assuming that the government shutdown will be unpopular, as the one was in 1995, it seems like it’s bad for Ryan’s budget, it seems like it’s bad for the Republicans.

FULL TRANSCRIPT: DOROTHY WICKENDEN: This is the Political Scene, a weekly conversation with New Yorker writers and editors about politics. It’s Thursday, April 7th. I’m Dororthy Wickenden, executive editor of The New Yorker. This week, Paul Ryan, head of the House Budget Committee, unveiled the Republican budget plan for 2012. At the same time, the White House and Congress were negotiating this year’s budget in yet another effort to head off a government shutdown. RECORDING OF RYAN: We can’t keep kicking this can down the road. The President has punted, we’re not going to follow suit, and, yes, we will be giving our political adversaries things to use against us in the next election, and shame on them if they use it. WICKENDEN: That was Paul Ryan this week, in one of a number of televised appearances arguing on behalf of the plan his committee devised to cut the deficit and debt by more than six trillion dollars in the next decade. I’m joined on the phone by staff writers Ryan Lizza and James Surowiecki. Jim, before we get into the controversy over the Ryan proposal, first tell us what’s in it. JAMES SUROWIECKI: Well, it’s really an attempt to kind of lay out a long-term budget for the U.S. that really would radically transform the nature of the relationship between the government and the economy. So, government would shrink dramatically—I think his plan is to try to cut, over the period of time, 6.1 trillion dollars. Medicare, instead of being what it is now, which is, you know, the government basically reimburses doctors and hospitals directly, instead vouchers would be handed out to senior citizens, and a lot of discretionary spending would be cut. And then, somewhat more mystifyingly, although not surprising, I guess, given that Ryan is a Republican, taxes would also be cut. In fact the top rate would drop from thirty-five per cent to twenty-five per cent. The point of the plan is basically to really radically reduce the role of government in the economy. There are a whole host of other elements of it, but that is basically the fundamental vision of it. WICKENDEN: That was a great synopsis—I understand it much better already. Ryan, actually I’m going to call you “Lizza” today, I think, to avoid confusion over the two Ryans. So, Lizza, Paul Ryan has been quoted as saying “It’s not a budget. It’s a cause.” But he comes across as a very genial young guy, and he’s tackling a problem that everyone else has avoided as politically toxic. I’ve heard him say that he’s not proposing anything as Draconian as ending Medicare as we know it, which is what his critics like to say. So, who is Paul Ryan, and how did he come to be the Republican’s go-to guy on fiscal policy? RYAN LIZZA: Well, he’s a relatively young guy. He’s from Wisconsin. And, I think you have to give Ryan credit for two things. One, he knows the details—he’s smart and can go head-to-head with any of the policy wonks on the left over these programs—and frankly, that’s rare among a lot of the folks on the Hill. And number two, he hasn’t shied away from presenting a pretty aggressive plan, even though he must know that the politics are very dangerous. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? WICKENDEN: Yes, and just to pick up on that, Jim, Jacob Weisberg at Slate this week called Ryan’s plan brave, radical, and smart. And, you know, you could say he comes at this slightly from the left. It seemed to me he made a pretty persuasive case, at least in parts of it, pointing out that Ryan is the first Republican in thirty years to propose the kinds of cuts that are needed to balance the budget. And he also argues that it could actually present an opportunity for the Democrats. Could you talk about that a little bit? SUROWIECKI: The one point that Jake makes that sort of makes sense is that basically the one thing that Ryan does do here that Republicans have really not done is essentially really lay out how you might get to where the Republicans say they want to get, so you know, some measure of balanced budget, et cetera. For me, the problem really—well there are a lot of problems with the budget—but I think the real thing with Ryan’s vision is that, although he may say that the goal isn’t to end Medicare as we know it, the economics of the numbers as he lays them out basically would mean that, say, ten or fifteen years from now, most seniors would be paying potentially most of their income in medical care because these vouchers would rise at the rate of inflation. And, unless something radical happens to cute the rate at which medical prices rise, that basically means that ten or fifteen years from now, those vouchers are going to be woefully inadequate. And so, you know, it’s really a pretty tough vision of what the role of government should be. And Jake’s right that now the Democrats now have a chance to push back against that. WICKENDEN: Lizza, tell us, because we always need reminding how… LIZZA: This reminds me of high school, being referred to by my last name, exclusively. (Laughs.) WICKENDEN: I kind of like it. So, Lizza, remind us about how ObamaCare deals with Medicare. Since President Obama has been so removed from this debate I need reminding, I’m sure our listeners do too, what did his plan do to address the rising costs of Medicare? LIZZA: Obama talked about reining in the rate of growth of medical care exclusively, and he tried to frame his entire healthcare plan, at certain points, exclusively as a plan to ratchet down the costs of Medicare. There’s two mechanisms that eventually made it into the law. So one of the them is the memorable ipab—that’s the Independent Payment Advisory Board. WICKENDEN: Not that memorable. (Laughs.) LIZZA: And, you know, I don’t want to pretend to be an expert on this, but the health-care wonks do claim that the ipab is this, sort of, very stealth, very powerful board that snuck its way into the health-care law. And basically what it allows is that this board can make changes to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare. Previously, there was a board set up, and it had to send its recommendations to Congress, and Congress actually had to affirmatively vote for them. It’s a tough vote if you’re a congressman—to vote for anything that is, arguably, cutting Medicare. This board has its own power, so it can actually make changes to Medicare, and Congress doesn’t need approve them. But Congress can, if they want, override those changes. So that’s a potentially very powerful tool, a big chunk of power flowing from Congress to the executive branch to ratchet down these costs. A couple other little things—there was a lot in the bill about information technology and comparative effectiveness, a lot of the stuff readers of the magazine will remember from Atul Gawande’s writing. And that stuff is going to take a while to show any impact. WICKENDEN: But isn’t that part of the problem? Here we go again with the Democrats presenting, you know, a very complicated plan, and the Republicans coming out with a quite bold, and seemingly simple way to get at it, and a much more clear-headed one, whatever you think of the merits of the arguments. SUROWIECKI: But one of the things that’s hypocritical, or complicated about Ryan’s budget is that Ryan’s budget will repeal the Affordable Care Act—so it will repeal ObamaCare, basically. Which means that, you know, if you have a preëxisting condition, you’re not going to be able to get insurance, beginning in 2014, as you will under current law. But, at the same time as he repeals ObamaCare, he keeps in place, or he assumes in place, the cost reductions that the Affordable Care Act was essentially going to enact. So in effect, he’s kind of assuming that he gets all the cost reductions that the Affordable Care Act was going to create via these mechanisms that Ryan talked about, but he basically wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. There’s a lot of this kind of slight of hand, but I think you’re right Dorothy, that the narrative, this kind of very clear-headed, “we’re making the tough choices” narrative, is probably politically beneficial. LIZZA: It proves again, you know, in Washington, once you get a reputation as a young, wonky, smart, honest kid from Wisconsin, you can throw all kinds of bullshit up against the wall, and the press won’t buy it, because that initial reputation that you established can take you a long way. WICKENDEN: Jim, let’s talk for a minute about the other big drama of the week, which is tied to the one we’ve just been discussing, which is the battle over this years’ budget and the possible shutdown of the government. What have been the sticking points there, and isn’t it all just, sort of, political posturing over a relatively modest difference of money here? SUROWIECKI: One thing to me that’s interesting about the overlap between these two things that we’re talking about—the Ryan budget and the fight over the government shutdown—is that, politically, at least, Ryan seems to be showing, at least to my mind, a little bit of a tin ear. Because I think one of the things that may happen, if the Democrats play this correctly is that the two things will become associated in the public mind. So, on the one hand, you have this budget which can sort of be spun as ending Medicare, or, you know, crippling Medicaid, blah-blah-blah, and at the same time, you have this government shutdown, were it to happen, and to the extent that those two things become linked, assuming that the government shutdown will be unpopular as the one was in 1995, it seems like that’s bad for Ryan’s budget, it seem like it’s bad for the Republicans. So it’s interesting to me, and I don’t know if Lizza has any insight into why—Ryan didn’t need to release the budget this week. I mean, he could’ve waited. LIZZA: Yeah, I’ve thought about that. SUROWIECKI: So the logic of that seems a little bit mysterious. LIZZA: I don’t know, there were two theories. One theory is that Boehner, his hold on his caucus is somewhat tenuous. And so Boehner’s number two, Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, they don’t have the greatest relationship in the world, and Cantor is much more aligned with the more conservative faction in the caucus. And frankly, Cantor’s people are constantly trying to stir up stories in the press about division between Boehner and Cantor, which is a surprising thing once you learn that. And the theory in Washington is that Cantor is looking for Boehner to stumble, and when he does, he’ll pounce, and he’ll have the support of the right-wing of the caucus, and one day move into the leadership spot there. So that’s some of the behind-the-scenes drama. And so, Ryan is aligned with that more conservative faction, and I think two theories about why he did this this week in the middle of these other negotiations: Perhaps he did it to give cover to conservatives and the Tea Party, who would be very angry if they see Boehner caving to the White House or agreeing to some deal that fell short of their expectations. And the other theory is the one I sort of laid out, is that this is Ryan, aligning himself with the young guns in the House, who see themselves as the post-Boehner leaders down the road. WICKENDEN: Lizza, let me ask you one more question. Michael Gerson, President George W. Bush’s former speechwriter wrote a column for The Washington Post a few days ago, and his argument was that Obama has played all this with a great cleverness—that is, the government shutdown possibility—that by accepting thirty-three billion dollars in cuts for the rest of 2011, he has taken the middle ground and exploited this division you guys have been talking about in the Republican coalition. What do you think of that? LIZZA: That makes a certain amount of sense. It might seem unreasonable to the average person the President has accepted thirty-three billion, but Republicans are going to shut it down because they didn’t get thirty-five or forty billion—this is the current number they’re asking for. The other change here, the other shift that we’re seeing, is, after the loss of the House, the White House decided that one of Obama’s big problems was he became slightly too much a creature of Washington, and that was mostly manifested by him engaging in too much detail in negotiations on the Hill. As one person put it to me, he became the Prime Minister, rather than the President. So they really have, for the last few months, tried to keep him above the fray, keep him from the day-to-day sniping and politics of Washington. And that’s been a feature of the recent negotiations. You know, you see this even in his speeches, where you’ll see a line in his speech where he lumps Democrats and Republicans in the same sentence as if he’s not a Democrat himself. WICKENDEN: Jim, just to round things off at the end here, how dire is the fiscal situation over the next ten years or so? SUROWIECKI: I don’t think over the next ten years it really is dire—I think that’s really a myth, basically. It’s not that the situation over the next ten years is good—I mean, we’re obviously borrowing huge sums of money every year and falling deeper into debt. But, first of all, that’s largely a function of the economic downturn, which really crushed tax revenues. And I think the best recipe for getting our fiscal house in order over the next ten years is really just getting the economy moving again. I think the direness of the fiscal situation is really the long-term issue, and to me, that basically boils down to one thing, and that is health-care spending. Until we get that under control, we have an incredibly difficult fiscal situation involved. But, you know that’s really the issue. LIZZA: That’s why everyone has to root for the ipab. WICKENDEN: (Laughs.) And just, finally, really quickly, the economy—how are you feeling right now with the new unemployment numbers? How well is the economy beginning to recover? SUROWIECKI: Well, I think the economy is underway. I mean, it’s been underway for a while, but I think what we’ve really started to see in the last few months is that things really are getting better. So the private sector is really creating jobs now at a reasonably good clip. It actually would be a totally respectable clip, if we weren’t coming out of this deep, deep, deep hole. So that’s good. The one wrench in the works at the moment is oil prices, which are high again, and that, more than it really matters in terms of dollars, it has this kind of psychological impact. But, I think even there, assuming we don’t see another big jump in prices, I think, you know, it takes the money out of consumers’ pockets, so I think we’ll be O.K. So, if we can keep moving in this direction, we would be in O.K shape, I guess, but next year. I think the economy is in much better shape than it was, say, six or eight months ago. WICKENDEN: Good, that’s a great note to end on. Thank you both. SUROWIECKI: All right, thank a lot. LIZZA: Thanks Wickenden. WICKENDEN: (Laughs.) Lizza and Surowiecki are staff writers.

"To-Do List: Snow, Crowds, and the Newest Meghan McCain",2454,"[#image: /photos/590954ea019dfc3494e9ea73] To know: Jordan’s King Abdullah II has dismissed Prime Minister Samir Rifai and his cabinet in response to growing unrest in the region. A Sudanese university student is reported to have been killed in anti-government protests there. President Obama’s health-care reform bill was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Florida—a decision that frees up the twenty-six states involved in the suit from complying with the legislation. (David Axelrod calls the ruling “dubious.”) And with another winter storm on its way, the governors of Missouri, Oklahoma, and Illinois have declared states of emergency. To monitor: Today’s march of tens of thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square. On the seventh day of turmoil on the streets of Egypt, “there were no immediate reports of clashes, and little sign of any security police,” reports the New York Times. Will the crowd get unruly? John Seabrook, who writes about crowds in this week’s magazine, describes the “common spirit at political gatherings.” (Join a live chat with Seabrook at 3 p.m. E.T.) To talk: North and South Korea, next Tuesday, for the first time since the North fired on Yeonpyeong Island in November, killing four South Koreans. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER   To vote: New York City’s Panel for Educational Policy, today and Thursday, on whether to close and phase out twenty-five of the city’s failing schools. To move to Tucson: The trial of Jared Lee Loughner, from Phoenix, for the ease of the witnesses and victims who will need to testify. (The defense can try to block the move, or file for another relocation later in the trial.) To follow Meghan McCain: Barbara Bush, who, like John McCain’s more vocal political daughter, has come out as an advocate of same-sex marriage, which her father, George W. Bush, had opposed during his Presidency. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. Sections More © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Seeing Spots,5381,"In the January 24th issue of The New Yorker, I wrote about health-care hot spotting. (Non-subscribers can now read the piece in full.) It’s a strategy, being tried in places like Camden, Atlantic City, and Boston, of focussing on the sickest five per cent of patients, who account for sixty per cent of health-care costs. Improving their care has created striking local successes: improved health, reduced hospitalizations, and lowered costs. But there have been critics, who fall into three camps: the defeatists, the catastrophists, and the triumphalists. But that is, of course, the key. The greatest engine of social change the world has ever seen is money, and in each of the cases I described, the hot spotters are learning to harness their ideas, born of virtue and altruism, to the more mundane but lasting motives of economics. This week, the New Jersey Senate Health Committee voted unanimously to advance a bill that would allow doctors like Jeff Brenner in Camden to form “Accountable Care Organizations”—organizations that get to keep a portion of every dollar they save Medicaid while maintaining or improving the quality of care. Key provisions in the new health reform law would allow Medicare to offer the same financial incentives. Elizabeth Gilbertson, the chief of the union health fund for casino workers, tells me it is now designing funding for new clinics to replicate its experimental Atlantic City clinic in Las Vegas and elsewhere. And other private insurers, including self-insured businesses, are offering the prospect of millions of dollars for companies like Verisk Health to scale these efforts. Some people can get rich making this stuff work. That’s long been a powerful motivator. To be sure, the defeatists could be right. All such efforts could fail. But it is not a given. As I’ve recounted previously, American agriculture was transformed by a series of humble-sounding interventions. A century ago, the cost of food ate up forty per cent of family budgets. Farmers were too slow to adopt key cost-lowering farming practices like using animal power rather than human power, rotating crops rather than using up all the land, cultivating seed beds more aggressively, and mechanizing. Such strategies required hard work and new learning. It also required the kind of up-front investment that a country of tenant farmers and sharecroppers had no incentive to make. But the government set up farmer’s coöperative banks with low-interest loans for the farmers to become landowners, sent out extension agents to teach the better practices that were being discovered, and created the National Weather Service and crop reports to provide the information farmers needed. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER 24/7 Surveillance Lighting: Who Is Watching—and Why? And it worked. Crop production rose, and the abundance of affordable food in our grocery stores eventually became our best argument for the American way. We could yet tell a similar story in this century about the transformation of our health-care system. For Goldberg, accepting a physician fee from Medicare makes you a government agent; by the same logic, we could describe surgeons like me as government agents going around cutting people open. And it would be creepy, if I were treating people against their will. But that’s not what surgeons do, and it’s not what hot spotters in primary care do, either. They are private-practice clinicians offering very sick people services that keep them less sick and out of the hospital. People can refuse, and some do. But most don’t—which is what may make this our best strategy for saving health-care costs. Certainly, some of what the hot spotters provide is the kind of primary-care service that everyone should have. They offer e-mail access. They follow up when people miss appointments, skip their medications, keep smoking, or gain too much weight. But their work goes far beyond this. Arnold Milstein, a Stanford University professor who is one of the fathers of the hot-spotting concept and a key consultant for the Atlantic City program, calls it “ambulatory intensive care.” And just as the one-to-one nursing of a hospital I.C.U. only makes sense for the sickest, so goes for the extra staffing of an ambulatory I.C.U.—especially if it is also going to save costs. The Defeatists strike me as having the most compelling argument. Solutions for great and complex societal problems are rare. There’s no guarantee that local successes can be replicated. But our best strategy is to look for ideas that work on a small scale and try to figure out how to make them work on a larger one. The right spirit is empirical: try things out, learn what you can, adjust, and try again. There are no foregone conclusions—except that we’ll fail if we don’t even try.

Finding Medicine’s Hot Spots,54345,"If Camden, New Jersey, becomes the first American community to lower its medical costs, it will have a murder to thank. At nine-fifty on a February night in 2001, a twenty-two-year-old black man was shot while driving his Ford Taurus station wagon through a neighborhood on the edge of the Rutgers University campus. The victim lay motionless in the street beside the open door on the driver’s side, as if the car had ejected him. A neighborhood couple, a physical therapist and a volunteer firefighter, approached to see if they could help, but police waved them back. “He’s not going to make it,” an officer reportedly told the physical therapist. “He’s pretty much dead.” She called a physician, Jeffrey Brenner, who lived a few doors up the street, and he ran to the scene with a stethoscope and a pocket ventilation mask. After some discussion, the police let him enter the crime scene and attend to the victim. Witnesses told the local newspaper that he was the first person to lay hands on the man. “He was slightly overweight, turned on his side,” Brenner recalls. There was glass everywhere. Although the victim had been shot several times and many minutes had passed, his body felt warm. Brenner checked his neck for a carotid pulse. The man was alive. Brenner began the chest compressions and rescue breathing that should have been started long before. But the young man, who turned out to be a Rutgers student, died soon afterward. The incident became a local scandal. The student’s injuries may not have been survivable, but the police couldn’t have known that. After the ambulance came, Brenner confronted one of the officers to ask why they hadn’t tried to rescue him. “We didn’t want to dislodge the bullet,” he recalls the policeman saying. It was a ridiculous answer, a brushoff, and Brenner couldn’t let it go. He was thirty-one years old at the time, a skinny, thick-bearded, soft-spoken family physician who had grown up in a bedroom suburb of Philadelphia. As a medical student at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, in Piscataway, he had planned to become a neuroscientist. But he volunteered once a week in a free primary-care clinic for poor immigrants, and he found the work there more challenging than anything he was doing in the laboratory. The guy studying neuronal stem cells soon became the guy studying Spanish and training to become one of the few family physicians in his class. Once he completed his residency, in 1998, he joined the staff of a family-medicine practice in Camden. It was in a cheaply constructed, boxlike, one-story building on a desolate street of bars, car-repair shops, and empty lots. But he was young and eager to recapture the sense of purpose he’d felt volunteering at the clinic during medical school. Few people shared his sense of possibility. Camden was in civic free fall, on its way to becoming one of the poorest, most crime-ridden cities in the nation. The local school system had gone into receivership. Corruption and mismanagement soon prompted a state takeover of the entire city. Just getting the sewage system to work could be a problem. The neglect of this anonymous shooting victim on Brenner’s street was another instance of a city that had given up, and Brenner was tired of wondering why it had to be that way. Around that time, a police reform commission was created, and Brenner was asked to serve as one of its two citizen members. He agreed and, to his surprise, became completely absorbed. The experts they called in explained the basic principles of effective community policing. He learned about George Kelling and James Q. Wilson’s “broken-windows” theory, which argued that minor, visible neighborhood disorder breeds major crime. He learned about the former New York City police commissioner William Bratton and the Compstat approach to policing that he had championed in the nineties, which centered on mapping crime and focussing resources on the hot spots. The reform panel pushed the Camden Police Department to create computerized crime maps, and to change police beats and shifts to focus on the worst areas and times. When the police wouldn’t make the crime maps, Brenner made his own. He persuaded Camden’s three main hospitals to let him have access to their medical billing records. He transferred the reams of data files onto a desktop computer, spent weeks figuring out how to pull the chaos of information into a searchable database, and then started tabulating the emergency-room visits of victims of serious assault. He created maps showing where the crime victims lived. He pushed for policies that would let the Camden police chief assign shifts based on the crime statistics—only to find himself in a showdown with the police unions. “He has no clue,” the president of the city police superiors’ union said to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “I just think that his comments about what kind of schedule we should be on, how we should be deployed, are laughable.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media The unions kept the provisions out of the contract. The reform commission disbanded; Brenner withdrew from the cause, beaten. But he continued to dig into the database on his computer, now mostly out of idle interest. Besides looking at assault patterns, he began studying patterns in the way patients flowed into and out of Camden’s hospitals. “I’d just sit there and play with the data for hours,” he says, and the more he played the more he found. For instance, he ran the data on the locations where ambulances picked up patients with fall injuries, and discovered that a single building in central Camden sent more people to the hospital with serious falls—fifty-seven elderly in two years—than any other in the city, resulting in almost three million dollars in health-care bills. “It was just this amazing window into the health-care delivery system,” he says. So he took what he learned from police reform and tried a Compstat approach to the city’s health-care performance—a Healthstat, so to speak. He made block-by-block maps of the city, color-coded by the hospital costs of its residents, and looked for the hot spots. The two most expensive city blocks were in north Camden, one that had a large nursing home called Abigail House and one that had a low-income housing tower called Northgate II. He found that between January of 2002 and June of 2008 some nine hundred people in the two buildings accounted for more than four thousand hospital visits and about two hundred million dollars in health-care bills. One patient had three hundred and twenty-four admissions in five years. The most expensive patient cost insurers $3.5 million. Brenner wasn’t all that interested in costs; he was more interested in helping people who received bad health care. But in his experience the people with the highest medical costs—the people cycling in and out of the hospital—were usually the people receiving the worst care. “Emergency-room visits and hospital admissions should be considered failures of the health-care system until proven otherwise,” he told me—failures of prevention and of timely, effective care. If he could find the people whose use of medical care was highest, he figured, he could do something to help them. If he helped them, he would also be lowering their health-care costs. And, if the stats approach to crime was right, targeting those with the highest health-care costs would help lower the entire city’s health-care costs. His calculations revealed that just one per cent of the hundred thousand people who made use of Camden’s medical facilities accounted for thirty per cent of its costs. That’s only a thousand people—about half the size of a typical family physician’s panel of patients. Things, of course, got complicated. It would have taken months to get the approvals needed to pull names out of the data and approach people, and he was impatient to get started. So, in the spring of 2007, he held a meeting with a few social workers and emergency-room doctors from hospitals around the city. He showed them the cost statistics and use patterns of the most expensive one per cent. “These are the people I want to help you with,” he said. He asked for assistance reaching them. “Introduce me to your worst-of-the-worst patients,” he said. They did. Then he got permission to look up the patients’ data to confirm where they were on his cost map. “For all the stupid, expensive, predictive-modelling software that the big venders sell,” he says, “you just ask the doctors, ‘Who are your most difficult patients?,’ and they can identify them.” The first person they found for him was a man in his mid-forties whom I’ll call Frank Hendricks. Hendricks had severe congestive heart failure, chronic asthma, uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, gout, and a history of smoking and alcohol abuse. He weighed five hundred and sixty pounds. In the previous three years, he had spent as much time in hospitals as out. When Brenner met him, he was in intensive care with a tracheotomy and a feeding tube, having developed septic shock from a gallbladder infection. Brenner visited him daily. “I just basically sat in his room like I was a third-year med student, hanging out with him for an hour, hour and a half every day, trying to figure out what makes the guy tick,” he recalled. He learned that Hendricks used to be an auto detailer and a cook. He had a longtime girlfriend and two children, now grown. A toxic combination of poor health, Johnnie Walker Red, and, it emerged, cocaine addiction had left him unreliably employed, uninsured, and living in a welfare motel. He had no consistent set of doctors, and almost no prospects for turning his situation around. After several months, he had recovered enough to be discharged. But, out in the world, his life was simply another hospitalization waiting to happen. By then, however, Brenner had figured out a few things he could do to help. Some of it was simple doctor stuff. He made sure he followed Hendricks closely enough to recognize when serious problems were emerging. He double-checked that the plans and prescriptions the specialists had made for Hendricks’s many problems actually fit together—and, when they didn’t, he got on the phone to sort things out. He teamed up with a nurse practitioner who could make home visits to check blood-sugar levels and blood pressure, teach Hendricks about what he could do to stay healthy, and make sure he was getting his medications. A lot of what Brenner had to do, though, went beyond the usual doctor stuff. Brenner got a social worker to help Hendricks apply for disability insurance, so that he could leave the chaos of welfare motels, and have access to a consistent set of physicians. The team also pushed him to find sources of stability and value in his life. They got him to return to Alcoholics Anonymous, and, when Brenner found out that he was a devout Christian, he urged him to return to church. He told Hendricks that he needed to cook his own food once in a while, so he could get back in the habit of doing it. The main thing he was up against was Hendricks’s hopelessness. He’d given up. “Can you imagine being in the hospital that long, what that does to you?” Brenner asked. I spoke to Hendricks recently. He has gone without alcohol for a year, cocaine for two years, and smoking for three years. He lives with his girlfriend in a safer neighborhood, goes to church, and weathers family crises. He cooks his own meals now. His diabetes and congestive heart failure are under much better control. He’s lost two hundred and twenty pounds, which means, among other things, that if he falls he can pick himself up, rather than having to call for an ambulance. “The fun thing about this work is that you can be there when the light switch goes on for a patient,” Brenner told me. “It doesn’t happen at the pace we want. But you can see it happen.” With Hendricks, there was no miraculous turnaround. “Working with him didn’t feel any different from working with any patient on smoking, bad diet, not exercising—working on any particular rut someone has gotten into,” Brenner said. “People are people, and they get into situations they don’t necessarily plan on. My philosophy about primary care is that the only person who has changed anyone’s life is their mother. The reason is that she cares about them, and she says the same simple thing over and over and over.” So he tries to care, and to say a few simple things over and over and over. I asked Hendricks what he made of Brenner when they first met. “He struck me as odd,” Hendricks said. “His appearance was not what I expected of a young, clean-cut doctor.” There was that beard. There was his manner, too. “His whole premise was ‘I’m here for you. I’m not here to be a part of the medical system. I’m here to get you back on your feet.’ ” An ordinary cold can still be a major setback for Hendricks. He told me that he’d been in the hospital four times this past summer. But the stays were a few days at most, and he’s had no more cataclysmic, weeks-long I.C.U. stays. Was this kind of success replicable? As word went out about Brenner’s interest in patients like Hendricks, he received more referrals. Camden doctors were delighted to have someone help with their “worst of the worst.” He took on half a dozen patients, then two dozen, then more. It became increasingly difficult to do this work alongside his regular medical practice. The clinic was already under financial strain, and received nothing for assisting these patients. If it were up to him, he’d recruit a whole staff of primary-care doctors and nurses and social workers, based right in the neighborhoods where the costliest patients lived. With the tens of millions of dollars in hospital bills they could save, he’d pay the staff double to serve as Camden’s élite medical force and to rescue the city’s health-care system. But that’s not how the health-insurance system is built. So he applied for small grants from philanthropies like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Merck Foundation. The money allowed him to ramp up his data system and hire a few people, like the nurse practitioner and the social worker who had helped him with Hendricks. He had some desk space at Cooper Hospital, and he turned it over to what he named the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers. He spoke to people who had been doing similar work, studied “medical home” programs for the chronically ill in Seattle, San Francisco, and Pennsylvania, and adopted some of their lessons. By late 2010, his team had provided care for more than three hundred people on his “super-utilizer” map. I spent a day with Kathy Jackson, the nurse practitioner, and Jessica Cordero, a medical assistant, to see what they did. The Camden Coalition doesn’t have enough money for a clinic where they can see patients. They rely exclusively on home visits and phone calls. Over the phone, they inquire about emerging health issues, check for insurance or housing problems, ask about unfilled prescriptions. All the patients get the team’s urgent-call number, which is covered by someone who can help them through a health crisis. Usually, the issue can be resolved on the spot—it’s a headache or a cough or the like—but sometimes it requires an unplanned home visit, to perform an examination, order some tests, provide a prescription. Only occasionally does it require an emergency room. Patients wouldn’t make the call in the first place if the person picking up weren’t someone like Jackson or Brenner—someone they already knew and trusted. Even so, patients can disappear for days or weeks at a time. “High-utilizer work is about building relationships with people who are in crisis,” Brenner said. “The ones you build a relationship with, you can change behavior. Half we can build a relationship with. Half we can’t.” One patient I spent time with illustrated the challenges. If you were a doctor meeting him in your office, you would quickly figure out that his major problems were moderate developmental deficits and out-of-control hypertension and diabetes. His blood pressure and blood sugars were so high that, at the age of thirty-nine, he was already developing blindness and advanced kidney disease. Unless something changed, he was perhaps six months away from complete kidney failure. You might decide to increase his insulin dose and change his blood-pressure medicine. But you wouldn’t grasp what the real problem was until you walked up the cracked concrete steps of the two-story brownstone where he lives with his mother, waited for him to shove aside the old newspapers and unopened mail blocking the door, noticed Cordero’s shake of the head warning you not to take the rumpled seat he’s offering because of the ant trail running across it, and took in the stack of dead computer monitors, the barking mutt chained to an inner doorway, and the rotten fruit on a newspaper-covered tabletop. According to a state evaluation, he was capable of handling his medications, and, besides, he lived with his mother, who could help. But one look made it clear that they were both incapable. Jackson asked him whether he was taking his blood-pressure pills each day. Yes, he said. Could he show her the pill bottles? As it turned out, he hadn’t taken any pills since she’d last visited, the week before. His finger-stick blood sugar was twice the normal level. He needed a better living situation. The state had turned him down for placement in supervised housing, pointing to his test scores. But after months of paperwork—during which he steadily worsened, passing in and out of hospitals—the team was finally able to get him into housing where his medications could be dispensed on a schedule. He had made an overnight visit the previous weekend to test the place out. “I liked it,” he said. He moved in the next week. And, with that, he got a chance to avert dialysis—and its tens of thousands of dollars in annual costs—at least for a while. Not everyone lets the team members into his or her life. One of their patients is a young woman of no fixed address, with asthma and a crack-cocaine habit. The crack causes severe asthma attacks and puts her in the hospital over and over again. The team members have managed occasionally to track her down in emergency rooms or recognize her on street corners. All they can do is give her their number, and offer their help if she ever wanted it. She hasn’t. Work like this has proved all-consuming. In May, 2009, Brenner closed his regular medical practice to focus on the program full time. It remains unclear how the program will make ends meet. But he and his team appear to be having a major impact. The Camden Coalition has been able to measure its long-term effect on its first thirty-six super-utilizers. They averaged sixty-two hospital and E.R. visits per month before joining the program and thirty-seven visits after—a forty-per-cent reduction. Their hospital bills averaged $1.2 million per month before and just over half a million after—a fifty-six-per-cent reduction. These results don’t take into account Brenner’s personnel costs, or the costs of the medications the patients are now taking as prescribed, or the fact that some of the patients might have improved on their own (or died, reducing their costs permanently). The net savings are undoubtedly lower, but they remain, almost certainly, revolutionary. Brenner and his team are out there on the boulevards of Camden demonstrating the possibilities of a strange new approach to health care: to look for the most expensive patients in the system and then direct resources and brainpower toward helping them. Jeff Brenner has not been the only one to recognize the possibilities in focussing on the hot spots of medicine. One Friday afternoon, I drove to an industrial park on the outskirts of Boston, where a rapidly growing data-analysis company called Verisk Health occupies a floor of a nondescript office complex. It supplies “medical intelligence” to organizations that pay for health benefits—self-insured businesses, many public employers, even the government of Abu Dhabi. Privacy laws prevent U.S. employers from looking at the details of their employees’ medical spending. So they hand their health-care payment data over to companies that analyze the patterns and tell them how to reduce their health-insurance spending. Mostly, these companies give financial advice on changing benefits—telling them, say, to increase employee co-payments for brand-name drugs or emergency-room visits. But even employers who cut benefits find that their costs continue to outpace their earnings. Verisk, whose clients pay health-care bills for fifteen million patients, is among the data companies that are trying a more sophisticated approach. Besides the usual statisticians and economists, Verisk recruited doctors to dive into the data. I met one of them, Nathan Gunn, who was thirty-six years old, had completed his medical training at the University of California, San Francisco, and was practicing as an internist part time. The rest of his time he worked as Verisk’s head of research. Mostly, he was in meetings or at his desk poring through “data runs” from clients. He insisted that it was every bit as absorbing as seeing sick patients—sometimes more so. Every data run tells a different human story, he said. At his computer, he pulled up a data set for me, scrubbed of identifying information, from a client that manages health-care benefits for some two hundred and fifty employers—school districts, a large church association, a bus company, and the like. They had a hundred thousand “covered lives” in all. Payouts for those people rose eight per cent a year, at least three times as fast as the employers’ earnings. This wasn’t good, but the numbers seemed pretty dry and abstract so far. Then he narrowed the list to the top five per cent of spenders—just five thousand people accounted for almost sixty per cent of the spending—and he began parsing further. “Take two ten-year-old boys with asthma,” he said. “From a disease standpoint, they’re exactly the same cost, right? Wrong. Imagine one of those kids never fills his inhalers and has been in urgent care with asthma attacks three times over the last year, probably because Mom and Dad aren’t really on top of it.” That’s the sort of patient Gunn uses his company’s medical-intelligence software program to zero in on—a patient who is sick and getting inadequate care. “That’s really the sweet spot for preventive care,” Gunn said. He pulled up patients with known coronary-artery disease. There were nine hundred and twenty-one, he said, reading off the screen. He clicked a few more times and raised his eyebrows. One in seven of them had not had a full office visit with a physician in more than a year. “You can do something about that,” he said. “Let’s do the E.R.-visit game,” he went on. “This is a fun one.” He sorted the patients by number of visits, much as Jeff Brenner had done for Camden. In this employed population, the No. 1 patient was a twenty-five-year-old woman. In the past ten months, she’d had twenty-nine E.R. visits, fifty-one doctor’s office visits, and a hospital admission. “I can actually drill into these claims,” he said, squinting at the screen. “All these claims here are migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, headache, headache, headache.” For a twenty-five-year-old with her profile, he said, medical payments for the previous ten months would be expected to total twenty-eight hundred dollars. Her actual payments came to more than fifty-two thousand dollars—for “headaches.” Was she a drug seeker? He pulled up her prescription profile, looking for narcotic prescriptions. Instead, he found prescriptions for insulin (she was apparently diabetic) and imipramine, an anti-migraine treatment. Gunn was struck by how faithfully she filled her prescriptions. She hadn’t missed a single renewal—“which is actually interesting,” he said. That’s not what you usually find at the extreme of the cost curve. The story now became clear to him. She suffered from terrible migraines. She took her medicine, but it wasn’t working. When the headaches got bad, she’d go to the emergency room or to urgent care. The doctors would do CT and MRI scans, satisfy themselves that she didn’t have a brain tumor or an aneurysm, give her a narcotic injection to stop the headache temporarily, maybe renew her imipramine prescription, and send her home, only to have her return a couple of weeks later and see whoever the next doctor on duty was. She wasn’t getting what she needed for adequate migraine care—a primary physician taking her in hand, trying different medications in a systematic way, and figuring out how to better keep her headaches at bay. As he sorts through such stories, Gunn usually finds larger patterns, too. He told me about an analysis he had recently done for a big information-technology company on the East Coast. It provided health benefits to seven thousand employees and family members, and had forty million dollars in “spend.” The firm had already raised the employees’ insurance co-payments considerably, hoping to give employees a reason to think twice about unnecessary medical visits, tests, and procedures—make them have some “skin in the game,” as they say. Indeed, almost every category of costly medical care went down: doctor visits, emergency-room and hospital visits, drug prescriptions. Yet employee health costs continued to rise—climbing almost ten per cent each year. The company was baffled. Gunn’s team took a look at the hot spots. The outliers, it turned out, were predominantly early retirees. Most had multiple chronic conditions—in particular, coronary-artery disease, asthma, and complex mental illness. One had badly worsening heart disease and diabetes, and medical bills over two years in excess of eighty thousand dollars. The man, dealing with higher co-payments on a fixed income, had cut back to filling only half his medication prescriptions for his high cholesterol and diabetes. He made few doctor visits. He avoided the E.R.—until a heart attack necessitated emergency surgery and left him disabled with chronic heart failure. The higher co-payments had backfired, Gunn said. While medical costs for most employees flattened out, those for early retirees jumped seventeen per cent. The sickest patients became much more expensive because they put off care and prevention until it was too late. The critical flaw in our health-care system that people like Gunn and Brenner are finding is that it was never designed for the kind of patients who incur the highest costs. Medicine’s primary mechanism of service is the doctor visit and the E.R. visit. (Americans make more than a billion such visits each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.) For a thirty-year-old with a fever, a twenty-minute visit to the doctor’s office may be just the thing. For a pedestrian hit by a minivan, there’s nowhere better than an emergency room. But these institutions are vastly inadequate for people with complex problems: the forty-year-old with drug and alcohol addiction; the eighty-four-year-old with advanced Alzheimer’s disease and a pneumonia; the sixty-year-old with heart failure, obesity, gout, a bad memory for his eleven medications, and half a dozen specialists recommending different tests and procedures. It’s like arriving at a major construction project with nothing but a screwdriver and a crane. Outsiders tend to be the first to recognize the inadequacies of our social institutions. But, precisely because they are outsiders, they are usually in a poor position to fix them. Gunn, though a doctor, mostly works for people who do not run health systems—employers and insurers. So he counsels them about ways to tinker with the existing system. He tells them how to change co-payments and deductibles so they at least aren’t making their cost problems worse. He identifies doctors and hospitals that seem to be providing particularly ineffective care for high-needs patients, and encourages clients to shift contracts. And he often suggests that clients hire case-management companies—a fast-growing industry with telephone banks of nurses offering high-cost patients advice in the hope of making up for the deficiencies of the system. The strategy works, sort of. Verisk reports that most of its clients can slow the rate at which their health costs rise, at least to some extent. But few have seen decreases, and it’s not obvious that the improvements can be sustained. Brenner, by contrast, is reinventing medicine from the inside. But he does not run a health-care system, and had to give up his practice to sustain his work. He is an outsider on the inside. So you might wonder whether medical hot-spotting can really succeed on a scale that would help large populations. Yet there are signs that it can. A recent Medicare demonstration program, given substantial additional resources under the new health-care-reform law, offers medical institutions an extra monthly payment to finance the coördination of care for their most chronically expensive beneficiaries. If total costs fall more than five per cent compared with those of a matched set of control patients, the program allows institutions to keep part of the savings. If costs fail to decline, the institutions have to return the monthly payments. Several hospitals took the deal when the program was offered, in 2006. One was the Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. It asked a general internist named Tim Ferris to design the effort. The hospital had twenty-six hundred chronically high-cost patients, who together accounted for sixty million dollars in annual Medicare spending. They were in nineteen primary-care practices, and Ferris and his team made sure that each had a nurse whose sole job was to improve the coördination of care for these patients. The doctors saw the patients as usual. In between, the nurses saw them for longer visits, made surveillance phone calls, and, in consultation with the doctors, tried to recognize and address problems before they resulted in a hospital visit. Three years later, hospital stays and trips to the emergency room have dropped more than fifteen per cent. The hospital hit its five-per-cent cost-reduction target. And the team is just getting the hang of what it can do. Recently, I visited an even more radically redesigned physician practice, in Atlantic City. Cross the bridge into town (Atlantic City is on an island, I learned), ignore the Trump Plaza and Caesars casinos looming ahead of you, drive a few blocks along the Monopoly-board streets (the game took its street names from here), turn onto Tennessee Avenue, and enter the doctors’ office building that’s across the street from the ninety-nine-cent store and the city’s long-shuttered supermarket. On the second floor, just past the occupational-health clinic, you will find the Special Care Center. The reception area, with its rustic taupe upholstery and tasteful lighting, looks like any other doctors’ office. But it houses an experiment started in 2007 by the health-benefit programs of the casino workers’ union and of a hospital, AtlantiCare Medical Center, the city’s two largest pools of employees. Both are self-insured—they are large enough to pay for their workers’ health care directly—and both have been hammered by the exploding costs. Yes, even hospitals are having a hard time paying their employees’ medical bills. As for the union, its contracts are frequently for workers’ total compensation—wages plus benefits. It gets a fixed pot. Year after year, the low-wage busboys, hotel cleaners, and kitchen staff voted against sacrificing their health benefits. As a result, they have gone without a wage increase for years. Out of desperation, the union’s health fund and the hospital decided to try something new. They got a young Harvard internist named Rushika Fernandopulle to run a clinic exclusively for workers with exceptionally high medical expenses. Fernandopulle, who was born in Sri Lanka and raised in Baltimore, doesn’t seem like a radical when you meet him. He’s short and round-faced, smiles a lot, and displays two cute rabbit teeth as he tells you how ridiculous the health-care system is and how he plans to change it all. Jeff Brenner was on his advisory board, along with others who have pioneered the concept of intensive outpatient care for complex high-needs patients. The hospital provided the floor space. Fernandopulle created a point system to identify employees likely to have high recurrent costs, and they were offered the chance to join the new clinic. The Special Care Center reinvented the idea of a primary-care clinic in almost every way. The union’s and the hospital’s health funds agreed to switch from paying the doctors for every individual office visit and treatment to paying a flat monthly fee for each patient. That cut the huge expense that most clinics incur from billing paperwork. The patients were given unlimited access to the clinic without charges—no co-payments, no insurance bills. This, Fernandopulle explained, would force doctors on staff to focus on service, in order to retain their patients and the fees they would bring. The payment scheme also allowed him to design the clinic around the things that sick, expensive patients most need and value, rather than the ones that pay the best. He adopted an open-access scheduling system to guarantee same-day appointments for the acutely ill. He customized an electronic information system that tracks whether patients are meeting their goals. And he staffed the clinic with people who would help them do it. One nurse practitioner, for instance, was responsible for trying to get every smoker to quit. I got a glimpse of how unusual the clinic is when I sat in on the staff meeting it holds each morning to review the medical issues of the patients on the appointment books. There was, for starters, the very existence of the meeting. I had never seen this kind of daily huddle at a doctor’s office, with clinicians popping open their laptops and pulling up their patient lists together. Then there was the particular mixture of people who squeezed around the conference table. As in many primary-care offices, the staff had two physicians and two nurse practitioners. But a full-time social worker and the front-desk receptionist joined in for the patient review, too. And, outnumbering them all, there were eight full-time “health coaches.” Fernandopulle created the position. Each health coach works with patients—in person, by phone, by e-mail—to help them manage their health. Fernandopulle got the idea from the promotoras, community health workers, whom he had seen on a medical mission in the Dominican Republic. The coaches work with the doctors but see their patients far more frequently than the doctors do, at least once every two weeks. Their most important attribute, Fernandopulle explained, is a knack for connecting with sick people, and understanding their difficulties. Most of the coaches come from their patients’ communities and speak their languages. Many have experience with chronic illness in their own families. (One was himself a patient in the clinic.) Few had clinical experience. I asked each of the coaches what he or she had done before working in the Special Care Center. One worked the register at a Dunkin’ Donuts. Another was a Sears retail manager. A third was an administrative assistant at a casino. “We recruit for attitude and train for skill,” Fernandopulle said. “We don’t recruit from health care. This kind of care requires a very different mind-set from usual care. For example, what is the answer for a patient who walks up to the front desk with a question? The answer is ‘Yes.’ ‘Can I see a doctor?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Can I get help making my ultrasound appointment?’ ‘Yes.’ Health care trains people to say no to patients.” He told me that he’d had to replace half of the clinic’s initial hires—including a doctor—because they didn’t grasp the focus on patient service. In forty-five minutes, the staff did a rapid run-through of everyone’s patients. They reviewed the requests that patients had made by e-mail or telephone, the plans for the ones who had appointments that day. Staff members made sure that all patients who made a sick visit the day before got a follow-up call within twenty-four hours, that every test ordered was reviewed, that every unexpected problem was addressed. Most patients required no more than a ten-second mention. Mr. Green didn’t turn up for his cardiac testing or return calls about it. “I know where his wife works. I’ll track her down,” the receptionist said. Ms. Blue is pregnant and on a high-blood-pressure medication that’s unsafe in pregnancy. “I’ll change her prescription right now,” her doctor said, and keyed it in. A handful of patients required longer discussion. One forty-five-year-old heart-disease patient had just had blood tests that showed worsening kidney failure. The team decided to repeat the blood tests that morning, organize a kidney ultrasound in the afternoon if the tests confirmed the finding, and have him seen in the office at the end of the day. A staff member read out the hospital census. Of the clinic’s twelve hundred chronically ill patients, just one was in the hospital, and she was being discharged. The clinic’s patients had gone four days without a single E.R. visit. On hearing this news, staffers cheered and broke into applause. Afterward, I met a patient, Vibha Gandhi. She was fifty-seven years old and had joined the clinic after suffering a third heart attack. She and her husband, Bharat, are Indian immigrants. He cleans casino bathrooms for thirteen dollars an hour on the night shift. Vibha has long had poor health, with diabetes, obesity, and congestive heart failure, but things got much worse in the summer of 2009. A heart attack landed her in intensive care, and her coronary-artery disease proved so advanced as to be inoperable. She arrived in a wheelchair for her first clinic visit. She could not walk more than a few steps without losing her breath and getting a viselike chest pain. The next step for such patients is often a heart transplant. A year and a half later, she is out of her wheelchair. She attends the clinic’s Tuesday yoga classes. With the help of a walker, she can go a quarter mile without stopping. Although her condition is still fragile—she takes a purseful of medications, and a bout of the flu would send her back to an intensive-care unit—her daily life is far better than she once imagined. “I didn’t think I would live this long,” Vibha said through Bharat, who translated her Gujarati for me. “I didn’t want to live.” I asked her what had made her better. The couple credited exercise, dietary changes, medication adjustments, and strict monitoring of her diabetes. But surely she had been encouraged to do these things after her first two heart attacks. What made the difference this time? “Jayshree,” Vibha said, naming the health coach from Dunkin’ Donuts, who also speaks Gujarati. “Jayshree pushes her, and she listens to her only and not to me,” Bharat said. “Why do you listen to Jayshree?” I asked Vibha. “Because she talks like my mother,” she said. Fernandopulle carefully tracks the statistics of those twelve hundred patients. After twelve months in the program, he found, their emergency-room visits and hospital admissions were reduced by more than forty per cent. Surgical procedures were down by a quarter. The patients were also markedly healthier. Among five hundred and three patients with high blood pressure, only two were in poor control. Patients with high cholesterol had, on average, a fifty-point drop in their levels. A stunning sixty-three per cent of smokers with heart and lung disease quit smoking. In surveys, service and quality ratings were high. But was the program saving money? The team, after all, was more expensive than typical primary care. And certain costs shot up. Because patients took their medications more consistently, drug costs were higher. The doctors ordered more mammograms and diagnostic tests, and caught and treated more cancers and other conditions. There’s also the statistical phenomenon known as “regression to the mean”: the super-high-cost patients may have been on their way to getting better (and less costly) on their own. So the union’s health fund enlisted an independent economist to evaluate the clinic’s one-year results. According to the data, these workers made up a third of the local union’s costliest ten per cent of members. To determine if the clinic was really making a difference, the economist compared their costs over twelve months with those of a similar group of Las Vegas casino workers. The results, he cautioned, are still preliminary. The sample was small. One patient requiring a heart transplant could wipe away any savings overnight. Nonetheless, compared with the Las Vegas workers, the Atlantic City workers in Fernandopulle’s program experienced a twenty-five-per-cent drop in costs. And this was just the start. The program, Fernandopulle told me, is still discovering new tricks. His team just recently figured out, for instance, that one reason some patients call 911 for problems the clinic would handle better is that they don’t have the clinic’s twenty-four-hour call number at hand when they need it. The health coaches told the patients to program it into their cell-phone speed dial, but many didn’t know how to do that. So the health coaches began doing it for them, and the number of 911 calls fell. High-cost habits are sticky; staff members are still learning the subtleties of unsticking them. Their most difficult obstacle, however, has been the waywardness not of patients but of doctors—the doctors whom the patients see outside the clinic. Jeff Brenner’s Camden patients are usually uninsured or on welfare; their doctors were happy to have someone else deal with them. The Atlantic City casino workers and hospital staff, on the other hand, had the best-paying insurance in town. Some doctors weren’t about to let that business slip away. Fernandopulle told me about a woman who had seen a cardiologist for chest pain two decades ago, when she was in her twenties. It was the result of a temporary, inflammatory condition, but he continued to have her see him for an examination and an electrocardiogram every three months, and a cardiac ultrasound every year. The results were always normal. After the clinic doctors advised her to stop, the cardiologist called her at home to say that her health was at risk if she didn’t keep seeing him. She went back. The clinic encountered similar troubles with some of the doctors who saw its hospitalized patients. One group of hospital-based internists was excellent, and coördinated its care plans with the clinic. But the others refused, resulting in longer stays and higher costs (and a fee for every visit, while the better group happened to be the only salaried one). When Fernandopulle arranged to direct the patients to the preferred doctors, the others retaliated, trolling the emergency department and persuading the patients to choose them instead. “ ‘Rogues,’ we call them,” Fernandopulle said. He and his colleagues tried warning the patients about the rogue doctors and contacting the E.R. staff to make sure they knew which doctors were preferred. “One time, we literally pinned a note to a patient, like he was Paddington Bear,” he said. They’ve ended up going to the hospital, and changing the doctors themselves when they have to. As the saying goes, one man’s cost is another man’s income. The AtlantiCare hospital system is in a curious position in all this. Can it really make sense for a hospital to invest in a program, like the Special Care Center, that aims at reducing hospitalizations, even if its employees are included? I asked David Tilton, the president and C.E.O. of the system, why he was doing it. He had several answers. Some were of the it’s-the-right-thing-to-do variety. But I was interested in the hard-nosed reasons. The Atlantic City economy, he said, could not sustain his health system’s perpetually rising costs. His hospital either fought the pressure to control costs and went down with the local economy or learned how to benefit from cost control. And there are ways to benefit. At a minimum, a successful hospital could attract patients from competitors, cushioning it against a future in which people need hospitals less. Two decades ago, for instance, Denmark had more than a hundred and fifty hospitals for its five million people. The country then made changes to strengthen the quality and availability of outpatient primary-care services (including payments to encourage physicians to provide e-mail access, off-hours consultation, and nurse managers for complex care). Today, the number of hospitals has shrunk to seventy-one. Within five years, fewer than forty are expected to be required. A smart hospital might position itself to be one of the last ones standing. Could anything that dramatic happen here? An important idea is getting its test run in America: the creation of intensive outpatient care to target hot spots, and thereby reduce over-all health-care costs. But, if it works, hospitals will lose revenue and some will have to close. Medical companies and specialists profiting from the excess of scans and procedures will get squeezed. This will provoke retaliation, counter-campaigns, intense lobbying for Washington to obstruct reform. The stats-and-stethoscope upstarts are nonetheless making their dash. Rushika Fernandopulle has set up a version of his Special Care program in Seattle, for Boeing workers, and is developing one in Las Vegas, for casino workers. Nathan Gunn and Verisk Health have landed new contracts during the past year with companies providing health benefits to more than four million employees and family members. Tim Ferris has obtained federal approval to spread his program for Medicare patients to two other hospitals in the Partners Healthcare System, in Boston (including my own). Jeff Brenner, meanwhile, is seeking to lower health-care costs for all of Camden, by getting its primary-care physicians to extend the hot-spot strategy citywide. We’ve been looking to Washington to find out how health-care reform will happen. But people like these are its real leaders. During my visit to Camden, I attended a meeting that Brenner and several community groups had organized with residents of Northgate II, the building with the highest hospital billing in the city. He wanted to run an idea by them. The meeting took place in the building’s ground-floor lounge. There was juice in Styrofoam cups and potato chips on little red plastic plates. A pastor with the Camden Bible Tabernacle started things off with a prayer. Brenner let one of the other coalition members do the talking. How much money, he asked, did the residents think had been spent on emergency-room and hospital visits in the past five years for the people in this one building? They had no idea. He wrote out the numbers on an easel pad, but they were imponderable abstractions. The residents’ eyes widened only when he said that the payments, even accounting for unpaid bills, added up to almost sixty thousand dollars per person. He asked how many of them believed that they had received sixty thousand dollars’ worth of health care. That was when the stories came out: the doctors who wouldn’t give anyone on Medicaid an office appointment; the ten-hour emergency-room waits for ten minutes with an intern. Brenner was proposing to open a doctor’s office right in their building, which would reduce their need for hospital visits. If it delivered better care and saved money, the doctor’s office would receive part of the money that it saved Medicare and Medicaid, and would be able to add services—services that the residents could help choose. With enough savings, they could have same-day doctor visits, nurse practitioners at night, a social worker, a psychologist. When Brenner’s scenario was described, residents murmured approval, but the mention of a social worker brought questions. “Is she going to be all up in my business?” a woman asked. “I don’t know if I like that. I’m not sure I want a social worker hanging around here.” This doctor’s office, people were slowly realizing, would be involved in their lives—a medical professional would be after them about their smoking, drinking, diet, medications. That was O.K. if the person were Dr. Brenner. They knew him. They believed that he cared about them. Acceptance, however, would clearly depend upon execution; it wasn’t guaranteed. There was similar ambivalence in the neighborhoods that Compstat strategists targeted for additional—and potentially intrusive—policing. Yet the stakes in health-care hot-spotting are enormous, and go far beyond health care. A recent report on more than a decade of education-reform spending in Massachusetts detailed a story found in every state. Massachusetts sent nearly a billion dollars to school districts to finance smaller class sizes and better teachers’ pay, yet every dollar ended up being diverted to covering rising health-care costs. For each dollar added to school budgets, the costs of maintaining teacher health benefits took a dollar and forty cents. Every country in the world is battling the rising cost of health care. No community anywhere has demonstrably lowered its health-care costs (not just slowed their rate of increase) by improving medical services. They’ve lowered costs only by cutting or rationing them. To many people, the problem of health-care costs is best encapsulated in a basic third-grade lesson: you can’t have it all. You want higher wages, lower taxes, less debt? Then cut health-care services. People like Jeff Brenner are saying that we can have it all—teachers and health care. To be sure, uncertainties remain. Their small, localized successes have not yet been replicated in large populations. Up to a fourth of their patients face problems of a kind they have avoided tackling so far: catastrophic conditions. These are the patients who are in the top one per cent of costs because they were in a car crash that resulted in a hundred thousand dollars in surgery and intensive-care expenses, or had a cancer requiring seven thousand dollars a week for chemo and radiation. There’s nothing much to be done for those patients, you’d think. Yet they are also victims of poor and disjointed service. Improving the value of the services—rewarding better results per dollar spent—could lead to dramatic innovations in catastrophic care, too. The new health-reform law—Obamacare—is betting big on the Brenners of the world. It says that we can afford to subsidize insurance for millions, remove the ability of private and public insurers to cut high-cost patients from their rolls, and improve the quality of care. The law authorizes new forms of Medicare and Medicaid payment to encourage the development of “medical homes” and “accountable care organizations”—doctors’ offices and medical systems that get financial benefits for being more accessible to patients, better organized, and accountable for reducing the over-all costs of care. Backers believe that, given this support, innovators like Brenner will transform health care everywhere. Critics say that it’s a pipe dream—more money down the health-care sinkhole. They could turn out to be right, Brenner told me; a well-organized opposition could scuttle efforts like his. “In the next few years, we’re going to have absolutely irrefutable evidence that there are ways to reduce health-care costs, and they are ‘high touch’ and they are at the level of care,” he said. “We are going to know that, hands down, this is possible.” From that point onward, he said, “it’s a political problem.” The struggle will be to survive the obstruction of lobbies, and the partisan tendency to view success as victory for the other side. Already, these forces of resistance have become Brenner’s prime concern. He needs state legislative approval to bring his program to Medicaid patients at Northgate II and across Camden. He needs federal approval to qualify as an accountable care organization for the city’s Medicare patients. In Camden, he has built support across a range of groups, from the state Chamber of Commerce to local hospitals to activist organizations. But for months—even as rising health costs and shrinking state aid have forced the city to contemplate further school cuts and the layoff of almost half of its police—he has been stalled. With divided branches at both the state and the federal level, “government just gets paralyzed,” he says. In the meantime, though, he’s forging ahead. In December, he introduced an expanded computer database that lets Camden doctors view laboratory results, radiology reports, emergency-room visits, and discharge summaries for their patients from all the hospitals in town—and could show cost patterns, too. The absence of this sort of information is a daily impediment to the care of patients in Boston, where I practice. Right now, we’re nowhere close to having such data. But this, I’m sure, will change. For in places like Camden, New Jersey, one of the poorest cities in America, there are people showing the way. ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Ask the Author Live: Atul Gawande on Medical Costs,17000,"This week in the magazine, Atul Gawande writes about medical costs. (Subscribers can read the full text; others can buy access to the issue via the digital edition.) Today Gawande answered readers’ questions in a live chat. A transcript of their discussion follows. ATUL GAWANDE: Hi, New Yorker readers. Thanks for joining me. I’m looking forward to the conversation. QUESTION FROM MIKEMOORE: I’m a medical student. How do you introduce the question of “cost” at the individual patient level. Everyone wants the “best” for their own health care…it seems like a tricky thing to talk about. ATUL GAWANDE: Great question. The short answer is you don’t. The lesson of folks like Jeff Brenner—or of the end of life article I wrote last summer—is that complex patients are often getting inadequate care. That’s precisely what MAKES them expensive. So what we have to do is spend the time and create the time to help our most complex patients meet their most important goals for their health and their lives. We don’t do it adequately. And that’s why they end up in the ER or the hospital or getting the fourth round of chemotherapy when it actually is causing more harm than good. QUESTION FROM NATHAN: How do physician salaries and med schools costs affect the cost of care in the US? ATUL GAWANDE: This is interesting. Physicians’ salaries are a small percentage of overall health costs, and with the increasing size of teams required for good care (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, bioengineers), not to mention bureaucratic middlemen, those salaries are a shrinking percentage. But physicians make the vast majority of the decisions that cost big money: whether to operate or not; what medication or test should be ordered; what the strategy should be for a complex patient who smokes, has heart disease and diabetes, and is on 11 medications. So: the question is how to pay physicians to reward using their skills more effectively and innovatively to reduce patients’ needs for the hospital or the operating room. QUESTION FROM MICHELLE FARMER: What is your perspective on a single payer healthcare system? The VA for example functions on a single payer model and has proven successful at lowering costs, improving health outcomes and reporting the highest patient satisfaction ratings of any US healthcare system. Yet discussions regarding implementing a single payer system at the state or national level seem to be taboo. ATUL GAWANDE: I think any approach that insures coverage for the millions who don’t have it is far better than what we have now. We know—for a fact—that tens of thousands of deaths occur each year because of lack of insurance. And we finally have a commitment in law that this is unacceptable. Other countries use private insurance, single-payer, and mixed approaches. There are tradeoffs for each of them. But they work. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? QUESTION FROM TREVOR: fdfdf ATUL GAWANDE: bkdeingmeo QUESTION FROM SCOTT THOMSON: Are any of the programs you described in danger of being de-funded by the new Congress? ATUL GAWANDE: All of them. QUESTION FROM NICHOLE: I work for a recently formed non-profit working on cutting health care costs and improving access, outcomes, and health literacy levels. The doctor at the heart of our organization is truly inspired by your work and is the perfect fit for this kind of work. We are in a place where change comes very slowly. Any general advice on getting started? Securing funding? Making progress in a city with two very powerful local health care giants dedicated to the status quo? ATUL GAWANDE: This is most of our communities, no doubt. The inertia of a system which has gotten used to 6-8% revenue increases every year is our danger. (Remember when the housing industry got that way?) But in every community, there is a Jeff Brenner. Probably several of them. Private insurers and Medicare/Medicaid are ready for leaders who come forward and offer to build an elite medical force that agrees to provide better care and coordination for the top 1-5% most expensive patients and begin lowering the system’s overall costs. QUESTION FROM DAVID G: In your opinion do you think that the recent trend in creating large groups of doctors will have a positive or negative impact on the cost curve? Do you think that the creation of large ACO models will help or should we focus more on smaller groups of primary care care doctors? ATUL GAWANDE: My focus has been on trying to define what great care for people that does not waste resources really looks like. Then we can back out from that what the best size and type of system for creating it is. My sense is that larger organizations that pull clinicians of all kinds together to be responsible (accountable) for costs and results are going to be more successful. But they could use that market power just to jack up prices, resulting in no better situation. Meanwhile, smaller medical groups may be more innovative. So we try both and observe what happens. The only mistake is paralysis. QUESTION FROM GUEST: I was interested in what you mentioned about the experimental program that saved time (and money) spent on paperwork by setting up a different payment model for docs. Do you think there’s an equivalent to charter schools that could be established within health care, where trial clinics could be subject to fewer bureaucratic regulations? Do such things already exist? And if so, is there a charter-school-esque debate about them? ATUL GAWANDE: Yes! The innovators I wrote about are essentially creating health care’s charter school equivalent. Whether it is a casino workers’ union or Medicare/Medicaid, they are looking to be cut free of the existing payment rules—which reward quantity of health care rather than quality—and let them try these different rules. They agree to be accountable for costs and results. And then they go. It’s very exciting, really. Already, with the impetus of health reform, local leaders are discovering that they actually can innovate. But there’s doubt among hospitals and medical groups about investing in them—because there’s uncertainty about whether all the new incentives and programs under health reform will be repealed by the time they start making these things work. QUESTION FROM LJR: The role of nurse has gradually expanded into 4 or 5 levels of health practitioning—everything from “Medical Assistant” on up to “Nurse Practitioner”. While NPs have, in the offices I’ve worked in, helped to get better care to more patients in less time, patients (and the public) still are hard to convince re this. What can be done re patient education here? ATUL GAWANDE: What’s hard to understand is that we are transitioning from getting our care from individual clinicians to getting our care from teams of people. The truth is that no doctor or nurse practitioner is capable of doing everything for patients well. We now have 13,600 diagnoses identified and for them effective methods for at least improving people’s lives that include 6000 drugs and 4000 procedures. Getting people the right diagnosis, the right care, safely, without errors or waste of resources, and with some kindness along the way is more than one NP or one MD can manage. We are going to need a primary care team that works intimately well with specialized resources of all kinds. QUESTION FROM NATHAN: As an ER volunteer, it was my job make sure every non-critical patient knew where the nearest primary care clinic was as they often didn’t know or care about it. Why are so many patients simply skipping primary care for high cost, often unnecessary, hospital work? I find it hard to believe that insurance coverage is the only cause… ATUL GAWANDE: Have you ever tried to get an appointment with your primary care doctor when you have a problem? In most communities, we have underinvested in primary care. So doctors’ panels are full. They don’t take new patients. And even for their patients, they often are unable to see them in a timely way. Surveys show that Americans face poorer access and service for primary care than in countries with universal health coverage. QUESTION FROM TIM RICHARDSON: With care provided in teams, is the extensive training physicians receive now still necessary? ATUL GAWANDE: Yes. But much of it is all wrong. We don’t teach physicians how to create successful organizations for patients, how to lead teams, nor how to be an effective team member when others are in the lead. Interesting experiment to me: University of Nevada, Reno, recently became the first medical school I’m aware of that combined its medical school and nursing school into the same building and many of the same classes. It’s a start. QUESTION FROM PETER: How clear is the line between super-utilizers and the rest of the people in need of care? Is there any chance that by devoting resources to those most in need, we will create more need in the rest of the sick? ATUL GAWANDE: This isn’t about rationing. It’s about bad design. When William Bratton (when he was NYC police chief) reorganized police shifts to focus on crime hot spots, it meant using the resources he had far better. So more of the police worked at night, when needed. Other shifts were still covered but more sensibly given the level of need. QUESTION FROM JED GOLDART: A widely shared conceptual framework defines health care value as a deliverable: meaningful, measurable, sustainable population health status improvement at lowest possible cost. Key numerator variables include the probability of 2 separate, necessarily linked health-related behaviors to occur: i.e., probability of providers recommending evidence-based care, and probability of consumers engaging and adhering with those recommendations. Robust epidemiologic studies provide the answer—documenting an average 50%, coin-flip, point-in-time probability for each and 25% combined probability of simultaneous population-level occurrence. Probability of receiving evidenced based care for behavioral and substance use disorders is even lower, with other studies documenting under 50% across the diagnostic spectrum (major depression 40%; psychosis 30%; substance abuse 10% respectively). Together, those research findings inform a working assumption for population health management—it is more likely than not that consumers are not adhering with evidence-based treatment recommendations and/or receiving treatment that is not evidenced-based, suboptimal or ineffective. ATUL GAWANDE: I think I get what you mean. Half of patients or more in our communities receive incomplete or inadequate care. It is an indication that the current way we provide care (relying on 20 minute office visits with individual clinicians who depend on memorizing everything they are supposed to know and do) is a failure. We will need teams. They will need smartly designed checklists to remind them about the stuff they cannot forget. And for the most complex, highest cost patients, they will need dedicated teams who are good at reducing smoking, or helping a patient through a cancer, or staying on their heart failure medications. You knew I had to get checklists in here somewhere, right? QUESTION FROM SUMON: The culture of immediate care and most comprehensive evaluation is a want by the average patient. This psychology is precisely exploited by many health care system. Any model that can overcome this status quo. ATUL GAWANDE: I don’t see any reason why service for patients can’t be timely—even immediate. And most of my patients don’t want the most comprehensive evaluation possible for everything. Taking time off to get this scan and that biopsy and poked and prodded by a sequence of specialists who don’t talk to one another is a nightmare for many of them. What I observe (certainly what I want when I need doctors) is timely, smart care with a trustworthy clinician leading a reliable team. I want them to do no more and no less than I require for good results. And hopefully it never has to involve the emergency room, the hospital, or knife. Unless it really has to. QUESTION FROM STEPHEN MEYERS, MD: There is much talk today of patient empowerment in terms of care quality and safety, but not cost. Do you feel that individual healthcare “cost empowerment” is possible today with currently available resources? Is there innovation you would like to see that would better enable individuals to actively participate in decisions that impact the cost of their care? ATUL GAWANDE: Yes. When it comes to whether I should see my doctor for an ankle sprain that might heal on its own, being responsible for part of the cost definitely affects whether I go. I make a value judgment about how important that is. And that’s probably as it should be for many situations. But the big problem is the conundrum of 5% of patients accounting for 60% of the costs. These are people whose health care expenses are usually over $50,000 a year because of a cancer, or heart disease, or mix of complex illnesses that are partly behaviorally related. It’s not clear how “cost empowerment” works for these patients. Small things can help. Eliminating their copayments for their asthma and diabetes meds may produce better cost decision-making. But “skin in the game” can easily backfire, as I wrote about. QUESTION FROM ALEXANDER MCKENNA: The Checklist Manifesto was terrific, I find ways to add checklists to my work all the time. ATUL GAWANDE: You’re the coolest. QUESTION FROM KIM: Yey checklists! I was hoping you’d sneak that in the conversation :) ATUL GAWANDE: Okay, let’s not get too excited… QUESTION FROM TIM RICHARDSON, PT: Can teams meet the needs of rural patients? Nurses, physical therapists, physician assistants and other extenders are in short supply. How can doctors possibly fulfill the need? ATUL GAWANDE: I come from a small southeastern Ohio town in a rural area. This is a major issue. So when I saw the Atlantic City program with its health coaches—who didn’t require any specialized degrees—helping the doctors and nurse practitioners insure patients were better able to meet their health goals and get access to the clinic when they needed it, I knew they were onto something. QUESTION FROM CB: I was wondering what your stance on personalized healthcare (i.e monthly fee for unlimited primary care office visits) and whether or not this is a feasible model to help curb the costs of increased healthcare prices when 90% of all illnesses can be resolved in a primary care setting. On another note from your experience, where do you think medicine should go to help drive down the costs to deliver health care? ATUL GAWANDE: Seeing this retained-based method of payment for primary care in action in Atlantic City was very appealing. Especially when it was focused on a clinic for the patients with the highest costs in the community. To drive down costs, what we have to recognize is that all medicine is local. It’s like politics that way. Health reform provides a toolbox that local health systems can use to reinvent the way they deliver care. And where those systems should go is toward designing better, less costly, more effective care systems for their top 1% most expensive patients first—and whatever their particular needs are. Then maybe go on to the top 5%. And so on. QUESTION FROM UK: Can teams work well in a virtual manner or does the care need to be 100% in-person? ATUL GAWANDE: Every one of the programs I wrote about used email and mobile phone communications with patients as a central part of what they did. Most doctors don’t do that—as you probably know all too well—because they only get paid for office visits. But opening lines of communication for patients seems self-evident to me to be good for care and service. ATUL GAWANDE: Last question I’m afraid… Let’s see here… QUESTION FROM GREGG MASTERS: what about the physician culture question? not relevant? ATUL GAWANDE: Yes. Culture matters. Of course, if physicians are rewarded or penalized for their service and results, the culture will change. But the key values we doctors are being pressed to embrace are humility, teamwork, and discipline. And these are not comfortable values for all of us. ATUL GAWANDE: I’m so sorry not to be able to get to all the questions. But thank you everyone. Now it’s time to go back to work.

Atul Gawande on the Super-Utilizers,4305,"[#image: /photos/5909579a2179605b11ad42e6] In this week’s New Yorker, Atul Gawande presents a case for lowering health-care costs by focussing on the most expensive patients. Inspired by law-enforcement techniques that zero in on clusters of crimes, Jeffrey Brenner, a physician in Camden, New Jersey, decided to combat excessive medical costs by treating the “super-utilizers.” (In Camden, one per cent of patients are responsible for thirty per cent of medical costs.) Brenner’s team, which includes a nurse practitioner and a social worker, make regular home visits and phone calls to check in about new and existing complaints, unfilled prescriptions, and other complications that could land them back in the hospital. They help apply for disability insurance and fill out paperwork for state-run housing where their medication can be overseen. They encourage these super-utilizers to improve their lives with steps like quitting smoking, cooking more, joining Alcoholics Anonymous—even going to church. Brenner found that his first thirty-six patients saw a forty-per-cent reduction in average monthly hospital and E.R. visits. They also saw a fifty-six-per-cent reduction in average hospital bills—savings that Gawande describes as “revolutionary.” Similar results were found at an Atlantic City clinic dedicated to super-utilizers on the health plans of the casino union and a local hospital; doctors at the clinic are paid a flat monthly fee per patient and the patients receive unlimited access to care. Rushika Fernandopulle, who runs the clinic, found that after twelve months the first twelve hundred patients had forty per cent fewer emergency-room visits and hospital admissions and twenty-five per cent fewer surgical procedures. An independent economist who studied these Atlantic City hospital workers found that their costs dropped twenty-five per cent compared to a similar population of high-cost patients in Las Vegas. These experiments in intensive outpatient care could transform health care well beyond southern New Jersey. As Gawande writes: An important idea is getting its test run in America: the creation of intensive outpatient care to target hot spots, and thereby reduce over-all health-care costs. But, if it works, hospitals will lose revenue and some will have to close. Medical companies and specialists profiting from the excess of scans and procedures will get squeezed. This will provoke retaliation, counter-campaigns, intense lobbying for Washington to obstruct reform. The stats-and-stethoscope upstarts are nonetheless making their dash. Rushika Fernandopulle has set up a version of his Special Care program in Seattle, for Boeing workers, and is developing one in Las Vegas, for casino workers. Nathan Gunn and Verisk Health have landed new contracts during the past year with companies providing health benefits to more than four million employees and family members. Tim Ferris has obtained federal approval to spread his program for Medicare patients to two other hospitals in the Partners Healthcare System, in Boston (including my own). Jeff Brenner, meanwhile, is seeking to lower health-care costs for all of Camden, by getting its primary-care physicians to extend the hot-spot strategy citywide. We’ve been looking to Washington to find out how health-care reform will happen. But people like these are its real leaders. Subscribers can read the article in the digital edition, and non-subscribers can purchase the individual issue to read online or on an iPad.

Ask the Author Live: Jeffrey Toobin on Bush v. Gore,22451,"This week in the magazine, Jeffrey Toobin writes about the ten-year anniversary of Bush v. Gore. Today Toobin answered readers’ questions in a live chat. A transcript of their discussion follows. THE NEW YORKER: Jeffrey Toobin will be joining us in just a few minutes. For now, please submit your questions. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Hi, everyone. QUESTION FROM DAVID ELMORE: The recount should have continued even if Gore lost, again. The court intruded where ‘the founding fathers’ specifically stated in the constitution (the ‘selective’ strict Constitutionalist’s always overlook this) that the Supreme Court h…as no place deciding Presidential elections, that is purely the domain of the House of Representatives. By not allowing the recount to proceed the Supreme Court decided the election, when they simply should have passed. It will stand as the U.S. Supreme Court’s deepest shame and disgrace; and has seriously harmed their credibility. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I can’t disagree with much of what you said. I wrote about Bush v. Gore extensively in my book “The Nine.” I’ve been accused of being somewhat obsessed with the decision. Guilty! QUESTION FROM WILLIAM MCEWAN: That election could have been called either way. Bush’s reelection four years later kinda makes the whole thing moot. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I could not disagree more. Fair procedures matter. It is true that if the Supreme Court had done the right thing and let Florida handle its own election, Bush might well have won. But the reelection is irrelevant to what happened in 2000. QUESTION FROM BARBARA PEDRICK BLIED: I would not trust them to decide who gets the biggest piece of the cake. They are totally compromised. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Well, that goes too far for me. I think for the most part they operate in good faith. But there is a lot of politics there too. QUESTION FROM TONY F.: The get over it excuse, which Scalia puts forth, is that almost an admission that it was political, rather than a legal reasoning? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Well, that’s a good point. And that’s why I included the quote. It’s revealing. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Documenting Her Wife’s Death on Social Media QUESTION FROM TURNERJDESOTO1: In Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court committed one of the baldest and biggest usurpations of political power in American history—without Constitutional, legal, legislative, or precedential standing. And the country paid, dearly, including a colossal loss in respect for the rule of law. It is a day that shall live in FEDERALIST infamy! Therefore, it leaves a lasting stain in the history of the Republic; even if the case is never cited. How to expunge it? JEFFREY TOOBIN: It’s easy to change the Supreme Court. Just elect the candidates of your choice president and keep electing them. The court is a reliable reflector of the broader politics of the day. That’s especially true now. QUESTION FROM MAGGIE: What has the court done to restore its credibility over the past ten years? And do most people, folks on the street, think that it’s compromised still? JEFFREY TOOBIN: The Supreme Court invariably scores very high in public esteem. It went down briefly after Bush v. Gore but came back pretty quickly. And the liberals did very well in the period 2001 to 2005. All the liberals who hated Justice Kennedy for Bush v. Gore loved him for Lawrence v. Texas, the gay rights case. Then they hated him again for Citizens United. QUESTION FROM LEWIS: Precisely how unprecedented is the current court’s blend of conservatism, both preached and practiced, and activism? Has there never before been a (politically) conservative SCOTUS that used conservative principles as a pretext for trampling on separation of powers? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I think the closest parallel is the early 1930s, when the conservatives struck down a series of New Deal laws—which led FDR to try his court-packing plan. There are a lot of similarities. QUESTION FROM LEWIS: Is there really hypocrisy in being a political conservative and a judicial activist? Or do you think that these two notions can co-exist, so long as the politically conservative justice doesn’t simultaneously try to pass for a champion of judicial restraint? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I don’t think there is any hypocrisy in being a political conservative and a judicial activist. The hypocrisy is being a judicial activist and pretending not to be one. QUESTION FROM MARGIE: I just watched last night’s interview with justice Stevens on 60 minutes and I wonder if me. Toobin could comment. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I saw it too. It was a very good picture of the man. He’s charming and smart and likable. If I may offer a small complaint, it followed with great precision all the subjects (even the quotes) in my New Yorker profile of Justice Stevens earlier this year. It would have been nice to get some credit. QUESTION FROM LEWIS: How do you think DC v. Heller specifically and originalism generally fit into this phenomenon? JEFFREY TOOBIN: There is a fascinating debate between Scalia (majority) and Stevens (dissent) in Heller, about who is being the true originalist on the subject of the second amendment. Since I don’t really buy originalism, I can’t say that either one persuaded me too much. QUESTION FROM RUBY: My children are homeschooled, i teach them myself, and the values i teach them are conservative, especially when it comes to how we are to interpret the constitution—as you say judicial restraint as opposed to judicial activism—don’t you believe it is important to imbue our children with the traditional values that support the Constitution? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I sure do. But the Constitution often involves conflicting values—freedom of speech vs. national security, free exercise of religion vs. no establishment of religion. The answers to these conflicts are neither simple nor easy to define. QUESTION FROM DAVID: Can you touch on why this was not dismissed as a political question issue? Wouldn’t the House of Representatives have been able to judge the propriety of the certification from the state electoral college? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Yes, the House would have been the ultimate arbiter. I don’t think it was a political question, because voting does implicate issues like federalism, due process and equal protection. QUESTION FROM SYD FERRET: Is 24x7 supply of news creating demand for diluted product? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I wouldn’t put it that way. Cable TV seems to be moving in the direction of talk radio—where partisans only listen to views they share. CNN is trying to be different, and I’m proud to work there as well as at The New Yorker. QUESTION FROM SYD FERRET: Yeah, just as we should get over Anita Hill JEFFREY TOOBIN: Fair point. But Mrs. THomas’s phone call to AH sure was interesting, wasn’t it? QUESTION FROM MARGIE METZLER: for many of us, we have never trusted the Court since that decision. and perhaps never will again. That is tragic. JEFFREY TOOBIN: That’s too harsh a verdict on the Court, in my opinion. I say that as someone who strongly disagreed with Bush v. Gore, as you know. QUESTION FROM LEWIS KAMINSKI: Where do you think Bush v. Gore rates with some of the other Supreme Court debacles? Is this as bad as Lochner? As bad as Dred Scott? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Good question. Not as bad as Dred Scott. Not as bad as Korematsu. Close to Lochner and the 1930s anti New Deal cases. QUESTION FROM LARRY: We all work for and are owned by corporations, they rule America. When are we going to realize this? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I don’t agree. Sure, corporations have a lot of power, but they have also been regulated for more than a hundred years. QUESTION FROM MARGIE METZLER: The Citizens United decision has poisoned this court for me. QUESTION FROM SYD FERRET: The anonymous political donor ruling in January was a disaster. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I thought I would put these two questions together. It’s clear that Citizens United touched a nerve that the Court didn’t expect. Just look at Justice Alito’s reaction during the state of the union. QUESTION FROM PHILM: How upsetting that ten years later, we’ve not enacted any federal election reform that could prevent something like the election being pushed so inelegantly, and unfairly, into the courts. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Well, the Help America Vote ACt (HAVA), which was passed in the immediate aftermath of Bush v. Gore, did a little to improve voting technology around the country. But not a great deal of reform, I grant you. QUESTION FROM FREDMAN: What would have happened if Bush v Gore had gone for Gore? Would we have had a legitimate result before Florida’s deadline to send an electoral delegation? Or would the Florida state legislature have been forced to do something even less legitimate? Did the Bush v. Gore II court have a legitimate logistical point? Were we trading one chaos for another? JEFFREY TOOBIN: This is a great question, and I think the honest answer is we’ll never know. I was in Tallahassee when the stay was entered on Sat. Dec 9. They were counting votes. It was an orderly process. I think they would have been finished in time. But we can never be sure. QUESTION FROM SRFMF: Do you think Clarence Thomas’ wife’s political activities are unsettling? What about the fact that his former staffer has basically admitted that yes he did act questionably, and slandered Anita Hill. This points to an embarrassing lack of credibility. Also (to quote Colbert) Scalia thinks he is a mind reading time traveller. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I think Virginia Thomas is entitled to be a political activist, which is work she did before she even met Justice Thomas. The question of whether Thomas or Hill told the truth is a separate issue. QUESTION FROM MARY: Toobs, you seem like a nice man, just a lil too obsessive about this case, why focus on why that is now so politically irrelevant? Obama’s in office now… JEFFREY TOOBIN: History matters too. (And I do write on other subjects.) The fact that Obama is in office matters little to whether Bush v. Gore was right. Some people are obsessed by Dred School (1857). Or Marbury v. Madison (1803). I’ve got mine, and it’s a little more contemproary at least. QUESTION FROM ALEX: There is a clip of you in a Michael Moore documentary (Farenheit 9/11 I think) saying on CNN, “Gore won,” I would not be surprised if Moore took this clip out of context, but could you talk about whether we know Gore would have won or not if the supreme court had not stopped it? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I know the reference. I was very surprised to see myself in F-911. I was making the same point I made in the Comment this week. The recounts showed that if the whole state had been recounted (as the Florida Supreme Court ordered), then Gore would have won. that’s what’s in the movie. I also say that if the four counties that gore wanted were counted, then Bush would have won. Moore did not use that part. QUESTION FROM CONRAD: Among other things, Bush v Gore illustrates the hazard of judicial activism. What monumentally bad results for the republic as a result of five thinking they knew better! JEFFREY TOOBIN: I can’t say I oppose all judicial activism. I like Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: I realize that there is guesswork and speculation involved but how do you think the justices would have voted if Bush had been seeking the recount and Gore opposing it. JEFFREY TOOBIN: This is the great question of Bush v. Gore. How much was the merits, and how much was it the motive? The problem with the conservatives’ decision in the case was that it was so far removed from their usual views (as I discuss in Comment this week). QUESTION FROM FREDDRIC: Do you see a conservative justice dying or retiring in the next 6 years? How do you feel about Obama’s appointees? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I think there will be several vacancies by the end of the term that begins in 2012. Scalia, Ginsburg, Kennedy, and Breyer are all in their seventies. QUESTION FROM PONY BOY: Damn, JT, you’re always trying to get credit for stuff you didn’t do? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Like what? I don’t take credit for anything. I have no influence on anything. Oh, maybe that’s a reference to 60 Minutes. Well, maybe that was ungenerous of me, but it did occur to me. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: Isn’t calling Massachusets v EPA a case where the conservatives put aside state’s rights principals because it was an environmental issue a reduction? That was a complex case about standing to sue a federal agency in court with lots of background precedent eg luja. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Fair point. I struggled with that example, because I know it’s a complex case and the court decided it on standing grounds. But after reading the dissent, I thought it was fair to make the point about federalism. QUESTION FROM HANK: Did you read Decision Points? JEFFREY TOOBIN: No, I looked up Bush v. Gore in the index and quoted the relevant passage. QUESTION FROM HANK MEDVED: How is CNN doing in the ratings these days? JEFFREY TOOBIN: There is room for improvement. QUESTION FROM ANTHONY: How do you feel the court will come down on the health care bill if it ever goes that far? JEFFREY TOOBIN: This and same sex marriage are the great questions on the horizon for the Court. Beats the hell out of me. QUESTION FROM BARRY LOGERSON: Sometimes i just wanna grab a hold of Roberts’s smug, arrogant, ass and punch him right in the puss! How’s that for judicial activism? JEFFREY TOOBIN: No punching please! QUESTION FROM STEVE: Do you think the current court would have botched Bush v. Gore just as badly? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I guess I never thought of it. On reflection: yes. QUESTION FROM FREDMAN: The New Deal cases weren’t that bad. Was Schecter wrongly decided? The NIRA was constitutional in your view? JEFFREY TOOBIN: NIRA was a bad law, but I think it was constitutional. And I do think Schecter was wrong. I like the expansive Commerce Clause of the late New Deal cases. The one about wheat … I forget the name. QUESTION FROM FREDMAN: Could these state voter compacts to coordinate with the popular vote with the electoral vote lead to national recounts? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Several states have adopted this proposal and my learned colleague Hendrik Hertzberg is a big fan of this idea. I think the answer is yes. It could work that way. QUESTION FROM KIM: What impact do you think having 3 women justices will have on the future decisions and/or deliberations of the Supreme Court? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Well, the Court certainly looks different. I was struck by the sight the first few times I saw the new Court. As for decisions, I think the gender matters a lot less than the judicial philosophy. There are conservative women and liberal women. The fact that these three appear to be (more or less) liberal is what matters. QUESTION FROM SG: What was Alito’s reaction during the State of the Union that you mention? JEFFREY TOOBIN: He shook his head and said, not true. QUESTION FROM JAMES SMITH: You write: “The Supreme Court stepped into the case even though the Florida Supreme Court had been interpreting Florida law; the majority found a violation of the rights of George W. Bush, a white man, to equal protection when these same Justices were becoming ever more stingy in finding violations of the rights of African-Americans.” But race had nothing to do with this case. Why do you seek to inject it in some undefined yet seemingly damning way? Not all equal protection cases involve race. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I think it’s worth noting that the same court that so rarely finds violations of equal protection for african americans (whom the Amendment was designed to protect) found a violation of George Bush’s rights … well, I think that is worth pointing out. QUESTION FROM LARRY: Yeah, and those regulations have been watered down and eroded in the past decade or so. Who got Obama elected? Sorros and Harpo Productions… Who literally owns and pays all the conservative candidates? News Corp. You owns you Ted Turner (formerly). It’s only going to get worse, and then Citizens United and Bush V Gore won’t look so bad… Take off the blinders. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Boy, I really don’t agree with your analysis. QUESTION FROM NICOLE BROWN: Do you miss covering the OJ trial? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Your handle is in bad taste. It was a great assignment, but I am not sorry it’s over. I do miss my pal Dominick Dunne. QUESTION FROM GUEST: How durable is B vs. G as judicial precendent. Noting our failure to address the fundamental causes of a contested elections (see above comments) and appreciating the possibility of this recurring at state or Federal level, will this decision live on and be perpetuated as precedent? JEFFREY TOOBIN: They haven’t cited it, as I pointed out in the comment, which suggests that it’s not a big-deal precedent. But what mattered was the result in the case, not the cases down the line. QUESTION FROM CRAIG: I’m confused, in your eyes, who should have won the election? Bush or Gore? JEFFREY TOOBIN: The Supreme Court cancelled the recount, so we’ll never know. QUESTION FROM MICHAEL: What are your thoughts on the language in Bush v. Gore that it shall not be considered precedential? To the passing observer, it seems a concession on its single-purposeness of putting Bush in the White House. JEFFREY TOOBIN: It’s the worst part of the decision. I used it as the epigraph for my book on the recount, “Too Close to Call.” The least a court should do is stand behind its own words. “This ticket good for this train only” is not how appeals courts should work. QUESTION FROM MELISSA: I loved your book “Too Close to Call.” It was infuriating to read. I just wanted to share that. Also are you on Twitter? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I am not yet on Twitter. Thanks for the kind words. I just don’t have enough to say to justify tweeting. QUESTION FROM BOSTON: Do you think the SCOTUS made the easier decision in Bush v. Gore? Would a ruling still have been necessary had the recount gone forward? Lawsuits from both sides? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Sure, there can always be lawsuits, but they would have been frivolous after a completed recount. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: Lets forget about Scalia, Thomas, Rehnquist for a moment. Do you think a case can be made that the MODERATE conservatives put aside principles for politics, i.e., O’Connor, Kennedy? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Yes, I do think you can make that case. I wish I didn’t believe that , but I do. QUESTION FROM TOM HILTON: Aside from Virginia Thomas ‘right’ to be an activist, what about the fact that she worked for the Bush transition team at the time her husband was considering Bush v. Gore? Seems like a pretty clear conflict. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I don’t think it’s such a conflict. She had no financial stake in the outcome. She didn’t stand to get a job. I don’t buy it as a conflict. QUESTION FROM ANTHONY: Do you ever see a time when the SC will allow cameras into the courtroom? JEFFREY TOOBIN: I wish. I think there will be live audio inside of a decade. But cameras are a different story. The justices are very institutionally conservative, and I will not hold my breath, although Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan have all made supportive sounds about it. QUESTION FROM MARGIE METZLER: Can you post an address where I can send you a fan letter? I read the Stevens article and also your book and you and Justice Stevens are my heroes. QUESTION FROM CHRIS: Even if the three conservatives voted for the wrong reasons, might the equal protection reasoning have been correct, Breyer and Souter signed on after all. JEFFREY TOOBIN: How nice to say. The New Yorker, 4 Times Square, NYC 10036. Many thanks. JEFFREY TOOBIN: Breyer and Souter just wanted the Florida court to establish a single standard for the recount. They didn’t want the recount stopped. QUESTION FROM KEVIN: How can we expect a group of individuals chosen by the executive of the federal government to maintain states rights? Aren’t presidents going to choose justices with views favorable to federal power vis-a-vis the states? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Not always. Many presidents believe in states’s rights and so have many justices over the years. Rehnquist and O’Connor, for two. QUESTION FROM LEWIS KAMINSKI: Picking up on the whole commerce/healthcare string, isn’t this all going to be a chance for Roberts et al to unmake a century worth of commerce clause jurisprudence? Could you foresee this Court going that far? (By the way, I think you’re thinking of Wickard) JEFFREY TOOBIN: Wickard! Right! Hard to say. I think Thomas is already on record with this view of the Commece Clause, and Scalia is close. Less clear about Roberts and Alito. I would not be surprised if they did. QUESTION FROM DANIEL: My issue with recent “politicization of the Court”: if Bush v. Gore went up before 1986, I suspect it would have been decided differently, and not primarily because the court was less conservative, but mostly because it would have taken due process more seriously and issued a decision that did not dismiss Florida’s internal procedures so thoroughly. JEFFREY TOOBIN: I don’t know. You assume a lot of good faith on the part of the justices. I hope it was merited. It’s very hard to assess motive. QUESTION FROM LOGAN: Do you think this conservative judicial activism will continue on LGBT rights cases like the Massachusetts DOMA case if it makes it to the SCOTUS? Will they abandoned their federalism and states’ rights ideals because of their moral beliefs? JEFFREY TOOBIN: Lots of swirling cross currents on the gay rights cases. I think the justices are worried about going against what they perceive as the will of the people. Every state has voted it down. And look what happened to the Iowa justices who voted for marriage equality. But the arguments for same sex marriage are very strong. It’s a tough, tough case. I hope they decide it before I finish work on my sequel to “The Nine.” Got to go. Thanks for taking the time to write in. Cheers, all.

A Foot on the Head,3380,"[#image: /photos/590953a0019dfc3494e9e445] “Are you talking down to me?” Jack Conway asked Rand Paul in their debate last night. At least he wasn’t asking him, as he did in their last encounter, when it was ever “a good idea to tie up a woman and have her kneel before a false idol.” So there’s that. This time, when they accused each other of being liars (Paul: “That’s a lie. You are dishonest.” Conway: “He’s just making something up.”) it was mostly about what could generously be called the issues, rather than whether Aqua Buddha gets what Aqua Buddha wants. But the debate still marked one of the lower points in this campaign season, when, as the candidates were arriving, some of Paul’s supporters grabbed a MoveOn.org activist in a blond wig—she’d tried to present Paul with a fake award from a fake company—and spun her to the ground, where one of them held her down while the other stomped on her head and neck. (She suffered a concussion and a sprained shoulder, according to MoveOn.org.) The Steelers’ James Harrison just got fined seventy-five thousand dollars for doing less than that—and what he did was on an N.F.L. field, to a guy in pads and a helmet. To complete the degradation of our political discourse, one of the attackers was wearing a button that said, “Don’t Tread on Me.” (via TPM.) Here’s the video: Then there’s Alaska, where the signature instrument of crowd-control has not been the foot on the head but the handcuff. (The handcuffers were the security detail of Joe Miller, the Republican; the handcuffee was a reporter; and the venue was a public event at a middle school.) In a debate Sunday night, Miller distracted attention from admissions about being suspended from his job for misusing government computers for political projects by saying, on the subject of controlling immigration, “if East Germany could, we could.” East German border control is fine, but Swedish healthcare isn’t? VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist When and where is this going to end? It’s not clear that the answer to that is really “next Tuesday,” although maybe some of the craziness will fall away, as some of the more startling candidates—and the oddities exist in both parties; Conway, for example, has had pretty low moments, too—lose. (And then what? Jostling with Juan Williams for airtime on Fox News?) But it is the nature of elections that someone wins; a lot of these people really are going to Congress, and to statehouses and legislatures and city halls. One would like to think that the campaign’s virulence is like a fever that will break. But once it does, we might find that the patient is paralyzed. We’re just getting started.

"Values, Liberal and Conservative (II)",5764,"Andrew Sullivan picks up on my last post, and gives a version of his own credo. You can read it here (c’mon, the guy needs traffic) or you can read it here: I also revere political rights (freedom of thought, speech, conscience, and the press, the right to vote, civil equality) but regard them as underpinned by the emergence of the autonomous individual that modern economic liberty made possible. I believe in simple and flat taxation of income and consumption and a generous public provision of education (the key to opportunity), but I think the welfare state should remain a minimal safety net and means-test benefits for those who are in real need, not grant them to everyone regardless of wealth. I believe in universal better-than-bare-bones healthcare, but oppose the government controlling it, and would be fine with the wealthier buying more of it and thereby getting better treatment. I don’t believe in mandatory provision of food and shelter to those who have decided to be free-loaders, as opposed to the unlucky or incapable. I think the market is the least worst system of allocating wealth and creating growth without which no welfare safety net can be afforded. I think the government absolutely has a role in protecting public goods like the environment, but should do so with great modesty about the limits of its own wisdom. I believe government should only try to redress economic inequality if such inequality becomes so great it threatens social cohesion and stability. I’m a secularist because I am also a believer, think the state hurts faith, rather than enables it, and that Christianity is more authentic the further from actual power it gets. I believe in world peace but also believe that this can only be achieved by the threat of war at times, and that military action should be a very last resort - but a real one, against those who would threaten us or destabilize the world. A lot of this, I’m glad to say, is more akin to elaboration than to disagreement. The way I read Andrew, he, like me, sees civil freedoms (of thought, conscience, the press, etc.) as inherently valuable—as ends in themselves—while esteeming economic freedoms for mostly instrumental reasons, i.e., as “underpinnings” for the really important stuff. That is an absolutely crucial point of agreement. And I basically endorse what he has to say about peace and war. Naturally, I don’t agree with him that income taxes should be flat. I’m surprised he agrees with himself. I would have thought he would agree with Adam Smith, who believed that, where practicable, public goods should be paid for directly, by way of taxes and tolls, by the people using them. But when this is neither practical nor desirable everyone should pay for them, and the rich should pay more than others. ""The rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion,"" Smith writes. That’s the word from another Adam—Gopnik—in the October 18th issue of The New Yorker. (If you were a subscriber, you could have the pleasure of reading A.G.’s entire essay, online or on paper. But I digress, as Gail Collins would say.) I also part company with Andrew’s sweeping embrace of means-testing, but mainly for prudential reasons. Some social goods need universal roots. I mean, public libraries wouldn’t last long if everybody above the poverty line had to fork over an admission fee to enter (plus a per-book copay). On the other hand, Andrew says it’s O.K. for government to take care of the basic needs of the “unlucky,” which leaves a lot of wiggle room for a welfare state. On yet another hand, he seems to think it wise to wait until the social order is visibly unravelling before trying to do something about gross and growing inequality. But my reading of The Dish tells me that he thinks we may be reaching that point already, so in practical terms we’re probably broadly in sync. Finally, I’m not sure what Andrew means by the government “controlling” health care. I know he’s no fan of his mother country’s NHS, but he supported President Obama’s health-care reforms through thick and thin. So I happily give him a pass—hell, a hug—on that subject. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Comedian Ayo Edebiri Tries to Keep Up with a New Yorker Cartoonist Addendum: An e-mail from Mike Kreuger, the blogger who provoked this whole discussion: Thank you for your comments in ‘Values, Liberal and Conservative.’ You were correct in inferring that I favor the Death Tax—on May 20, 2010, I wrote an entry on my blog titled, ‘Why I like the Death Tax.’ And I took flak in my recent congressional campaign for supporting universal health care, albeit a stripped-down, safety-net version, not ObamaCare that will tend to socialize medicine and afford Cadillac coverage for all. Like you, I believe that progressive taxation and regulation of ‘externalities’ can be consistent with economic freedom. Here’s the blog entry he’s talking about. Remarkably sane, as are a lot of his other entries, judging from the sampling I took finding this one. Mike, I hope you win the Republican primary next time. We’ll see about the general.

Of Feast and Famine,3541,"If you’re ever puzzling over a turn in Chinese behavior or decision-making, it is often a good idea to check for clues in the political history of Chinese food. When Chairman Mao declared, “A revolution is not a dinner party,” that was his way of warning people not to expect excessive civility in the course of transforming the country. Alas, it was a tragic understatement. As historians have only begun to detail, Mao Zedong’s economic policies from 1958 to 1962 subjected his people to what we know now was the world’s most devastating famine. “The death toll stands at a minimum of forty-five million excess deaths,” according to Frank Dikötter, of the University of Hong Kong, author of “Mao’s Great Famine,” which uses newly opened archives and original interviews to detail the calamity in calm, if unavoidably grisly, detail. (Out in the U.K., scheduled for the U.S. later this month.) VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER What Happens When Childhood Fears Are Bottled Up? Among the stories of cannibalism and people eating mud, there is also the grand narrative: Why? The answer lies in Mao’s misguided ambition to overtake Britain in the output of iron, steel, and other products in just fifteen years, which triggered a political mania of coercion and deprivation, as people struggled to fulfill unachievable goals. I have often marvelled at the scale of the catastrophe not only because of what it reminds us about the perils of demagoguery, but also for how recent it all was. The vividness of that memory—the sheer determination of today’s Chinese adults to leave behind the deprivation of their parents and grandparents—is an extraordinarily powerful engine, and it helps us understand the drive behind China’s headlong rush into the age of consumption. Which leads us to the other notable book of the moment: “Fat China: How Expanding Waistlines Are Changing a Nation.” Authors Paul French and Matthew Crabbe have explored how “changing diets, modern lifestyles, investment from foreign fast food and supermarket retailers and urban planning” are lending China a very American problem. Rural China still has areas of extreme poverty, and yet an estimated two hundred million Chinese people—over fifteen per cent, almost entirely in cities—now qualify as obese, a phenomenon that will have all of the obvious effects on China’s “already overburdened healthcare system.” As French tells Jeremy Goldkorn in an interview at Danwei, “It’s an achievement for China overall. It’s literally famine to gluttony in two generations.” Whenever someone asks me why Chinese citizens ultimately tolerate the corruption and curbs on personal liberties that accompany the current state of affairs—or why they react with such force to ethnic movements that they view as a threat to stability—I point out that other deprivations still loom larger in the collective memory. Until another generation has grown up in the fat years, that is unlikely to change soon. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Lisa Murkowski, the incumbent who was expected to win the Republican Senate primary in Alaska. The battle is still too close to call between her and Joe Miller, whom Sarah Palin endorsed. Shushannah Walshe at The Daily Beast wrote yesterday that Murkowski was mulling a jump to the Independent party if the absentee ballots handed the primary victory to Miller, but Nicole Allan at the Atlantic says that Murkowski missed the deadline to do so; her only hope in this election would be as a write-in (unlikely) or a Libertarian—but only if the current Libertarian candidate drops out.
