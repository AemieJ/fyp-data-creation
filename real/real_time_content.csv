Read the Passionate Jimmy Kimmel Healthcare Monologue | Time,904,"O
n Tuesday night, Jimmy Kimmel took to his late night show once more to talk healthcare — a subject near and dear to him personally, after his infant son dealt with heart surgery in the days after his birth last May. He delivered a heartfelt monologue then about the importance of adequate health coverage for all Americans, and in the wake of new healthcare legislation from Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsay Graham, he returned to the subject with an emotional plea. Kimmel then played a CNN clip proving that Cassidy had, indeed, created this test. (Medical experts who have assessed the Graham-Cassidy bill do not believe it would sufficiently cover people with pre-existing conditions like Billy.) They played another clip of Cassidy, this time appearing alongside Kimmel on his show. In the video, Cassidy says “Yep” to Kimmel’s question about Americans receiving healthcare, regardless of income.","SEPTEMBER 20, 2017"
Here's Who the CDC Says Will Get the COVID-19 Vaccine First | Time,6817,"F
rontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of long-term care facilities will receive the very first COVID-19 vaccinations, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory board recommended Tuesday. These groups will make up Phase 1A of U.S. vaccine recipients who will receive the first 40 million or so doses that could be available by the end of the year. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing two vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, for emergency use authorization. According to the CDC, there are about 21 million healthcare workers, including people who work in hospitals, long term care facilities, home healthcare, pharmacies, emergency medical services as well as in public health, and about 3 million older Americans living in skilled nursing or long term care facilities. The 13 to 1 vote by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was the first official step toward prioritizing who will get the scarce first doses of any COVID-19 vaccine. Over the nearly four hour meeting, the committee discussed in detail who within these two priority groups would get access first when doses are limited early on. For example, the committee wanted to ensure that people who work directly in providing patient care will be first in line. Read more: The First U.S. Shipments of COVID-19 Vaccines Will Include 6.4 Million Doses The reasons for focusing on healthcare workers and long term care residents include both the potential for magnifying the impact of vaccination: If healthcare workers are protected, they will be able to continue working and caring for more people with COVID-19 as cases continue to spread across the country. The board also focused on the groups most impacted by the disease. While only 1% of the US population lives in long term care, the residents and the staff who work there account for 6% of COVID-19 cases and 40% of the deaths. “I believe my vote [in favor of the recommendation] reflects maximizing benefit, minimizing harm, promoting justice and mitigating health inequities,” Dr. Jose Romero, the committee chair, said in explaining his support of the priority groups. The recommendation now go to the director of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield, who does not have to accept it but likely will. If he accepts the recommendation, state health departments can start making decisions about how to allocate the anticipated 6.4 million doses that will be the first batch released within days of the FDA authorizing a vaccine. They will probably go to hospitals where healthcare workers are most concentrated, as well as to pharmacies that have contracted with long term care facilities to administer shots to residents and staff. Read more: Yes, We Have COVID-19 Vaccines That Are 95% Effective. But That Doesn’t Mean the End of the Pandemic is Near The committee also discussed at length the systems in place for collecting and monitoring reports of side-effects and adverse events from the vaccine. Participants in large-scale trials for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have reported no major adverse effects, however the CDC closely monitors the safety of all vaccination programs. The CDC is planning several levels of check ins, beginning with a smartphone-based texting system that vaccinated people can register for in order to report side effects. The agency will also utilize existing national systems that doctors and healthcare providers routinely use to track vaccine side effects, as well as institutional systems for reporting adverse events by hospitals and other facilities. Dr. Helen Talbot, associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, was the only member to vote against the recommendation, based solely on her misgivings about the lack of safety data on vaccinating residents of long term care facilities. “I’ve spent my career studying vaccines in older adults, and traditionally we’ve tried vaccines in young, healthy populations and hoped it worked in frail, older adults,” she said during the meeting. “We have now entered the realm of ‘We hope it works, we hope it’s safe,’ and that concerns me on many levels.” She noted that while studies so far show that the elderly who are vaccinated don’t experience significantly higher adverse events, that could also mean that the vaccine isn’t as effective, either. (So far, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna report that their shots are around 95% effective in protecting against disease in all age groups.) Second, Talbot said she worried that long term care facilities aren’t equipped to properly monitor potential adverse effects from vaccinations. “I’m still struggling with that since we don’t have a good safety surveillance network in place yet,” she said. It will likely fall to the healthcare professionals at these facilities to take on reporting of any unusual symptoms after residents are vaccinated, but that could place an additional burden on already taxed teams—not to mention that the symptoms of fever, fatigue and coughing are often common among frailer people in this age group so it will be harder to determine which symptoms need to be reported. CDC board members also discussed practical issues such as whether healthcare workers in a particular facility should be vaccinated in a staggered fashion to avoid personnel shortages in case people develop side effects severe enough to keep them from working. Ultimately, based on the growing number of cases and the urgent need to corral the spreading virus, the committee members felt that, at least to begin with, vaccinating healthcare workers and those living in long term care facilities made the most sense. The recommendation, said Dr. Peter Szilagyi, professor pediatrics at University of California, Los Angeles, “helps to maintain our healthcare system and protect a very fragile population.” The committee’s recommendation is focused only on who should receive the first doses of vaccine once a shot is authorized by the FDA, and doesn’t represent a recommendation that people should get vaccinated against COVID-19 — yet. That will come after an advisory committee for the FDA meets in mid-December and makes a decision about whether COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective enough to distribute. Then, the ACIP committee will meet again to make recommendations about specific vaccines. While most of the American public won’t be eligible to receive the first doses of vaccine that might be available this year, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said the end is in sight. “For all the people who are anxiously awaiting [a COVID-19] vaccine,” she said, “we hope this vote gets us one step closer to the day when we can all feel safe again, when this pandemic is over.”","DECEMBER 1, 2020"
Obama's Trauma Team | Time,40199,"L
ast Oct. 17–more than two weeks after the launch of HealthCare.gov–White House chief of staff Denis McDonough came back from Baltimore rattled by what he had learned at the headquarters of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in charge of the website. McDonough and the President had convened almost daily meetings since the Oct. 1 launch of the website with those in charge–including Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner and White House health-reform policy director Jeanne Lambrew. But they couldn’t seem to get what McDonough calls “actionable intel” about how and why the website was failing in front of a national audience of stunned supporters, delirious Republican opponents and ravenous reporters. “Those meetings drove the President crazy,” says one White House senior adviser who was there. “Nobody could even tell us if the system was up as we were sitting there, except by taking out laptops and trying to go on it. For Denis, going to Baltimore was like leaving Washington and visiting a war zone.” But not even a trip to the war zone produced good intel. According to notes from a meeting in one of CMS’s three war rooms (yes, things were so uncoordinated that there were three), those assembled discussed the fact that “we heard that the capacity”–the number of possible simultaneous users–“was 100,000 people, and there are 150,000 people on it.” Yet five days later, White House chief technology officer Todd Park would tell USA Today that the capacity was 50,000 and that the website had collapsed because 250,000 people tried to use it at the same time. Park, a highly successful–but, for this job, disablingly mild-mannered–health care tech entrepreneur, had been kept out of the planning of the website. In fact, the site’s actual capacity at the time was “maybe a few thousand users,” according to a member of the team that later fixed it. What McDonough was able to pry out of the beleaguered crew at CMS on his Baltimore visit was that even on Oct. 17–by which time the site’s failure was the subject of daily headlines and traffic had collapsed–only 3 in 10 people were able to get on at all. And of the lucky third that did, most were likely to be tossed off because there were so many other bugs. Unknown to a nation following the fiasco, McDonough’s assignment from the President had boiled down to something more dire than how to fix the site. As the chief of staff remembers his mission, it was “Can it be patched and improved to work, or does it need to be scrapped to start over? He wanted to know if this thing is salvageable.” Yes, on Oct. 17, the President was thinking of scrapping the whole thing and starting over. When McDonough got back to the White House, he met with Jeff Zients, a highly regarded businessman who had won high marks as a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Among other projects, Zients–who in looks and résumé is the epitome of the buttoned-up manager–had overseen the Cash for Clunkers program in 2009. He was now slated to take over in January as the director of the President’s National Economic Council. Obama and McDonough had quietly brought Zients in the week before when it had become obvious that the early White House and CMS explanation for the website’s problems–astonishingly high volume–was anything but the whole story. Zients, who is not an engineer, was teamed with Park, the White House chief technology officer. “On Oct. 17, I went from White House CTO to full-time HealthCare.gov fixer,” Park says. The two were charged, says Zients, with “finding fresh eyes who could decide whether the thing was salvageable.” As one of the engineers they recruited put it, “Maybe we had to tell the world we’ll be back to you in six or nine months with a new site.” As McDonough and Zients were digesting what the chief of staff had learned in Baltimore, White House press secretary Jay Carney was going through what one senior Obama aide calls “probably the most painful press briefing we’ve ever seen … It was like one of those scenes out of The West Wing where everyone’s yelling at him.” Thursday, Oct. 17, was the day the government shutdown ended. Until then, the failed launch of the website on Oct. 1 had been overshadowed in the news–and in the questions Carney had to field every day–by the shutdown and the related threat of a debt-ceiling deadlock. Now the unfolding Obamacare disaster was center stage. Carney tried to fend off the inquisition, but he had little to work with. Pressed repeatedly on when the site would be fixed, the best he could say was that “they are making improvements every day.” “They” were, in fact, not making improvements, except by chance, much as you or I might reboot or otherwise play with a laptop to see if some shot in the dark somehow fixes a snafu. Yet barely six weeks later, HealthCare.gov not only had not been scrapped, it was working well and on its way to working even better. This is the story of a team of unknown–except in elite technology circles–coders and troubleshooters who dropped what they were doing in various enterprises across the country and came together in mid-October to save the website. In about a tenth of the time that a crew of usual-suspect, Washington contractors had spent over $300 million building a site that didn’t work, this ad hoc team rescued it and, arguably, Obama’s chance at a health-reform legacy. It is also a story of an Obama Administration obsessed with health care reform policy but above the nitty-gritty of implementing it. No one in the White House meetings leading up to the launch had any idea whether the technology worked. Early on, Lambrew, highly regarded as a health care policy expert and advocate for medical care for the poor, kept Park off the invitation list for the planning meetings, according to two people who worked on the White House staff prior to the launch. (The White House declined to make Lambrew available for an interview.) The only explanation Park offers for his exclusion is that “The CTO helps set government technology policy but does not get involved in specific programs. The agencies do that.” The other attendees were also policy people, pollsters or communications specialists focused largely on the marketing and political challenges of enrolling Americans. McDonough, as chief of staff, was supposed to be tending to everything associated with the rollout, including the technology. But he and Lambrew simply accepted the assurances from the CMS staff that everything was a go. Two friends and former colleagues of McDonough’s say they spoke to him 36 hours prior to the launch, and in both conversations he assured them that everything was working. “When we turn it on tomorrow morning,” he told one friend, “we’re gonna knock your socks off.” Months later, when I asked him in February if he should have worried more about the website, McDonough admitted, “Would I do things differently if I had a chance to? Absolutely.” 1. Return of the Campaign Geeks Early on the morning of Friday, Oct. 18, Gabriel Burt, whose résumé actually includes work as a rocket scientist, woke up in a room at the DoubleTree in Columbia, Md., about 35 miles outside Washington. Burt, 30 at the time, had flown there from Chicago the night before, toting an overnight bag for what he thought might be a two- or three-day trip. By the following weekend his wife would be flying in to resupply him. He didn’t get home until Dec. 6. Burt is the chief technology officer at a Chicago company called Civis Analytics. Park, the White House CTO, had connected with him via the White House political office. How did Obama’s political people know about Burt’s firm? Because Civis is the home of the Obama-campaign whiz kids who re-engineered politics in 2012. Burt and a team of coders and data analysts had developed tools that could sift data so finely that finding and tracking persuadable voters to make sure they turned out to vote was brought to a whole new level. Soon after the campaign, the group formed a company to sell its services to nonprofits, governments and private companies. Its sole investor is Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, who had helped organize their work as an informal Obama campaign adviser. The Civis website describes its creation this way: “Our company was born in a large backroom of the Obama 2012 re-election headquarters. We called it the analytics cave … From millions of data points, we constructed the most accurate voter targeting models ever used in a national campaign. We predicted the election outcome in every battleground state within one point. And our work guided decisionmaking and resource optimization across the campaign … This company is our next step,” the website continues. “We are taking our team outside The Cave to solve the world’s biggest problems using Big Data.” In fact, Obamacare had indirectly become a Civis client. Following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a nonprofit called Enroll America was formed with the goal of boosting enrollment in the coming insurance exchanges through grassroots organizing and targeted advertising. Enroll America is funded–in “the tens of millions,” says its president, Anne Filipic, a former Obama campaign worker–not only by some political groups sympathetic to health care reform, like Families USA, but also by businesses that will benefit from people enrolling, chief among them insurance companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The organization became one of Civis’ first and biggest clients. Before the website crashed on Oct. 1, this kind of marketing-oriented data crunching was seen as central to the drama of whether Obamacare would succeed. The political intrigue and punditry around the launch was mostly about whether people would come to the website exchanges, not what would happen to them once they got there. Through the summer of 2013, David Simas, who then had the title of White House deputy senior adviser for communications, gave rounds of interviews detailing how big data, much of it provided to Enroll America by Civis, was being used to target specific precincts, say, in Miami or Houston, to identify the uninsured, make contact with them–“We want multiple touches,” Simas told me–and lure them into enrolling. When I interviewed Simas in September, he assured me that “everything has been tested and is working perfectly … Our challenge is getting the right people to show up.” McDonough, in telling associates that the Obamacare launch was consuming an hour or two of his every day, similarly focused on the communications and outreach planning rather than the technology. The press, too, concentrated on the purported marketing and enrollment hurdles. One favorite theme was that the White House had brought back its 2012 Obama-campaign whiz kids for an encore data-crunching, polling and messaging blitz, which is why Simas, a campaign pollster, data analyst and message maven, had assumed center stage . It turns out that when it came to Civis’ skills, McDonough, Simas and the others were working the wrong side of the house. Civis is great at analytics, but behind that world-class data crunching is a world-class technology team run by Gabriel Burt. Indeed, the key mistake made by President Obama and his team–who never publicized the arrival of Burt and other campaign coders in October the way they touted the role of the data-analytics marketing team last summer–is that they had turned only to the campaign’s marketing whiz kids instead of the technologists who enabled them. 2. A Team Formed On the Fly Among the tech geniuses Burt got to know during the 2012 campaign is Mikey Dickerson–whose title at Google is site-reliability engineer. Dickerson had taken a leave from Google in 2012 to help scale the Obama-campaign website and create its Election Day turnout-reporting software. As it happened, Dickerson, then 34, was in town visiting Burt and others at Civis on Oct. 11 when Park called from the White House. “I consider Mikey a mentor,” says Burt. “We were picking his brain about our company when we got a call about the health care site … We all wanted to do something.” Burt and Dickerson decided to go to Washington to help Park figure out what to do. They also began making a list of others who they thought could form a rescue squad. By the afternoon of Oct. 18, Burt was on the ground at the headquarters in Maryland of a company called QSSI, one of the contractors that had been hired by CMS to build and run the website. Of the many companies that had worked on HealthCare.gov, QSSI was thought to have performed the least badly. That afternoon, Dickerson, who was in California preparing to fly east the following Monday to join Burt, jumped on what he later described as a “really bizarre conference call.” It was with Park, who at that moment was riding in a White House van around D.C., Maryland and Virginia with the beginnings of his hastily assembled team trying to assess the damage. In the van was Paul Smith, whom Burt had recruited. Smith had been deputy director of the Democratic National Committee’s tech operation. He immediately put fundraising for a startup he was planning on hold to join the group. Another passenger was Ryan Panchadsaram, 28, who had come to the White House as part of a program called Presidential Innovation Fellows, which was launched by Park to bring high-tech achievers into government to work on specific projects that they design. (The program is already responsible for a series of innovations in making government data and health care records more available electronically.) “I decided we should all go introduce ourselves to the people we were going to help,” says Park, explaining the van ride. The team started by driving from the White House to see Tavenner, the CMS administrator, at her Washington office. They then drove off to Baltimore to meet other senior CMS officials. It was during that drive that Park decided to loop in Dickerson and some others to a conference call. “We were passing around an iPhone with a speaker so we could all talk,” says Park. “I wanted us to get to know each other.” “I had no idea who this guy leading the call was, and you couldn’t hear a lot of it,” recalls Dickerson, who was wearing a T-shirt sporting an image of a nuclear reactor over the word Science! when I met him three weeks ago in the Roosevelt Room across from the Oval Office. “Finally I jumped in and asked, ‘Who am I talking to? Who is leading this call?’ And the guy says, ‘I’m Todd Park.’ So I Googled him and saw he’s the chief technology officer of the country and had founded two health care technology companies. Oh, I figured. Not bad. So I made plans to fly out for a few days.” Park’s van continued on from Baltimore, stopping at the two main contractors working on the website. It turned out the engineers at both QSSI and even CGI, the contractor that attracted much of the blame for the site’s failure, did not seem nearly as defensive or hostile as Park and the others had feared. “These guys want to fix things. They’re engineers, and they were embarrassed,” says one of the members of Park’s gathering band. “Their bosses might have been turf conscious, but by then the guys in the suits really didn’t want to have anything to do with the site, so they were glad to let us take over.” When the meetings ended at a CMS outpost in Herndon, Va., at about 7:00 p.m., the rescue squad already on the scene realized they had more work to do. One of the things that shocked Burt and Park’s team most–“among many jaw-dropping aspects of what we found,” as one put it–was that the people running HealthCare.gov had no “dashboard,” no quick way for engineers to measure what was going on at the website, such as how many people were using it, what the response times were for various click-throughs and where traffic was getting tied up. So late into the night of Oct. 18, Burt and the others spent about five hours coding and putting up a dashboard. What they saw, says Park, was a site with wild gyrations. “It looked awfully spiky,” recalls Panchadsaram. “The question was whether we could ride that bull. Could we fix it?” The team went home at about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 19. 3. “It’s Just a Website. We’re Not Going to the Moon.” The decision had still not been made whether to save or scrap HealthCare.gov. Zients wanted even more eyes from Silicon Valley on the problem. At about 6 in the morning on Saturday, Oct. 19, he emailed John Doerr, a senior partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Menlo Park, Calif.–based venture-capital powerhouse, whose investments include Amazon, Google, Sun, Intuit and Twitter. Could Doerr call him when he awoke to talk about the health care website? Zients asked. When Doerr quickly called back, Zients said, “We’re pulling together this surge of people to do this assessment to see if the site’s fixable or not. We’ve got to do it incredibly quickly. Do you know anyone?” Doerr recommended a relatively new Kleiner partner named Mike Abbott. “Mike saved Twitter’s technology when it was failing,” Doerr told me later, referring to the days when the Twitter Fail Whale error-message icon was ubiquitous. “His being there gave me the confidence to make the largest investment we had ever made–over $100 million … He had also worked at Microsoft and led the team at Palm that rebuilt their system … Yet he’s really low-key and well liked.” Abbott spoke to Zients the next day, Sunday, Oct. 20, and flew to Washington on Oct. 21. That day, Obama offered what the New York Times called “an impassioned defense of the Affordable Care Act” in a Rose Garden statement, “acknowledging the technical failures of the HealthCare.gov website but providing little new information about the problems with the online portal or the efforts by government contractors to fix it.” Nor did the President volunteer that he had recruited a team whose first job was to decide whether to kill the website and start over. “The first red flag you look for,” says Abbott, “is whether there is a willingness by the people there to have outside help. If not, then I’d say it’s simpler to write it new than to understand the code base as it is if the people who wrote it are not cooperating. But they were eager to cooperate.” “The second thing, of course, was, What were the tech problems? Were they beyond repair? Nothing I saw was beyond repair. Yes, it was messed up. Software wasn’t built to talk to other software, stuff like that. A lot of that,” Abbott continues, “was because they had made the most basic mistake you can ever make. The government is not used to shipping products to consumers. You never open a service like this to everyone at once. You open it in small concentric circles and expand”–such as one state first, then a few more–“so you can watch it, fix it and scale it.” What Abbott could not find, however, was leadership. He says that to this day he cannot figure out who was supposed to have been in charge of the HealthCare.gov launch. Instead he saw multiple contractors bickering with one another and no one taking ownership for anything. Someone would have to be put in charge, he told Zients. Beyond that, Abbott recalls, “there was a total lack of urgency” despite the fact that the website was becoming a national joke and crippling the Obama presidency. But by then, Dickerson–the Google reliability guru and Burt’s mentor–had arrived. “I knew Mikey by reputation,” Abbott recalls. “He was a natural fit to lead this team.” Looking over the dashboard that Park, Burt and the others had rigged up the prior Friday night, Abbott and the group discovered what they thought was the lowest-hanging fruit–a quick fix to an obvious mistake that could improve things immediately. HealthCare.gov had been constructed so that every time a user had to get information from the website’s vast database, the website had to make what’s called a query into that database. Well-constructed, high-volume sites, especially e-commerce sites, will instead store or assemble the most frequently accessed information in a layer above the entire database, called a cache. That way, the query to it can be faster and not tie up connections to the overall database. Not doing that created a huge, unnecessary bottleneck, the equivalent of slowing down traffic on an on-ramp to an otherwise empty highway. The team began almost immediately to cache the data. The result was encouraging: the site’s overall response time–the time it took a page to load–dropped on the evening of Oct. 22 from eight seconds to two. That was still terrible, of course, but it represented such an improvement that it cheered the engineers. They could see that HealthCare.gov could be saved instead of scrapped. Also weighing in by this time on the phone and through chat lines was another Silicon Valley legend recruited by Zients who also happened to be named Abbott. Marty Abbott had been the CTO of eBay and now ran a consulting business that offered high-tech crisis management and evaluation. Venture funds pay him “tens of thousands of dollars a day,” says Zients, to kick the tires, hard, of potential companies seeking their money, and the companies themselves hire him when their websites or other technology crash. “It was pretty obvious from the first look that the system hadn’t been designed to work right,” says Marty Abbott. “It was not really managed at all and wasn’t architected to scale. For example, any single thing that slowed down would slow everything down.” Marty Abbott volunteered his time, which was limited to participation in multiple conference calls in the first few weeks of the salvage effort. Mike Abbott was also a volunteer; he stayed in the D.C. area until Oct. 25, then participated through December on conference calls, sometimes doing two or three a day. As for Dickerson, Burt and the others who arrived for what they thought was a few days only to stay eight to 10 weeks, they were told that government regulations did not allow them, even though they offered, to be volunteers if they worked for any sustained period. So they were put on the payroll of contractor QSSI as hourly workers, making what Dickerson says was “a fraction” of his Google pay. The day after their first breakthrough with the caching, Dickerson and the rest of the team gave Zients and Park their verdict: they could fix the site by the end of November, six weeks away, so that “the vast majority” of visitors could go on and enroll. “I was, like, never worried,” Dickerson adds. “It’s just a website. We’re not going to the moon.” A few hours later on the afternoon of Oct. 23, Zients and McDonough told the President the news. According to Zients, the President “pressure-tested the decision,” putting them through a series of questions related to why they thought they could make that deadline. Then he signed off on it. There was one further irony: the general contractor Zients and Park had chosen to coordinate things, they told the President, was QSSI, which had handled some of the more successful functions of the ailing website. Andy Slavitt, a top executive from another unit of QSSI’s parent company–UnitedHealth Group, the giant insurer–would be called in to run the QSSI team. Which meant that the largest player in an industry that had vehemently opposed Obamacare in 2010 was now about to take a lead role in saving it. And profiting from it. 4. Stand-Ups And Hiccups It was in a 4,000-sq.-ft. room rented by QSSI in a nondescript office park in Columbia, Md.–lined with giant Samsung TV monitors showing the various dashboard readings and graphs–that Barack Obama’s health care website was saved. What saved it were Mikey Dickerson’s stand-ups. Stand-ups, which Mike Abbott says became a standard part of his playbook at Twitter, are Silicon Valley–style meetings where everyone usually stands rather than sits and works through a problem or a set of problems, fast. Then everyone disperses, acts and reports back at the end of the day at a second stand-up. Dickerson held the first one on Oct. 24. He would convene them every day, including weekends, in October and November, at 10:00 in the morning and 6:30 in the evening. Each typically ran about 45 minutes (“causing some of us to sit down,” Dickerson concedes). An open phone line would connect people working on the website at other locations; in fact, the open line would remain live 24 hours a day so that everyone could immediately talk to the others if an issue suddenly came up. Dickerson quickly established the rules, which he posted on a wall just outside the control center. Rule 1: “The war room and the meetings are for solving problems. There are plenty of other venues where people devote their creative energies to shifting blame.” Rule 2: “The ones who should be doing the talking are the people who know the most about an issue, not the ones with the highest rank. If anyone finds themselves sitting passively while managers and executives talk over them with less accurate information, we have gone off the rails, and I would like to know about it.” (Explained Dickerson later: “If you can get the managers out of the way, the engineers will want to solve things.”) Rule 3: “We need to stay focused on the most urgent issues, like things that will hurt us in the next 24–48 hours.” The stand-up culture–identify problem, solve problem, try again–was typical of the rescue squad’s ethic. They worked stretches of three or four days during which they might have had five or 10 hours of sleep cumulatively, often changing clothes only when they made a shopping trip to the nearby mall. They and the dozens of willing, even eager, engineers they led–who worked for the contractors who had failed so badly to lead them in the run-up to Oct. 1–pounded away on the bugs that Dickerson had demanded they identify every morning, focus on and clear up in time for the evening stand-up. They began to sweep across increasingly big swaths of their punch list. Well, actually, they hummed along happily for less than three days, until the whole site crashed at 1:20 a.m. on Sunday morning, Oct. 27, two days after Zients had announced that all would be well by Nov. 30. A switch had failed during maintenance work at a data center. The outage lasted 37 hours, during which Dickerson and his team could do little because they had no website to look at. Then, two days later at 4:00 p.m. on Oct. 29, it went down again because of a malfunction in a data-storage unit. This outage lasted 40 hours, including the afternoon of Oct. 30, when HHS Secretary Sebelius testified about the website’s troubles before a loaded-for-bear House of Representatives subcommittee, whose majority Republican members flashed images on their tablets and iPhones of the website being down as they questioned her. “In her testimony Ms. Sebelius came across as a hapless official,” the New York Times reported. “Those outages were totally demoralizing,” says Burt. “We thought we were on our way. We had gotten some momentum but lost it.” “We just kept saying, ‘Let’s pick ourselves up and fight,'” Park recalls. “And when the site came back, we pushed ahead nonstop … We went from doing three or four releases”–upgrades or changes to the website–“in October to 25 in November.” “The team,” says Zients, “ran two-minute drills to perfection. We had the best players on the field. Some plays didn’t work. We talked about some of those. But there was never any finger pointing. People just hustled right back to the line, and we ran the next play.” Dickerson was so adamant about the need to forgo finger pointing and move on to the next play that during one stand-up in mid-November he demanded a round of applause for an engineer who called out from the back of the room that a brief outage had probably been the result of a mistake he had made. Zients isn’t a techie himself. He’s a business executive, one of those people for whom control–achieved by lists, schedules, deadlines and incessant focus on his targeted data points–seems to be everything. He began an interview with me by reading from a script crowning the team’s 10-week rescue mission as the White House’s “Apollo 13 moment,” as if he needed to hype this dramatic success story. And he bristled because a question threatened not to make “the best use of the time” he had allotted. So for him, this Apollo 13 moment must have been frustrating–because in situations like this the guy in the suit is never in control. True, Zients had assembled a terrific team that had gelled perfectly. But his engineers could move only so fast. Though he had carte blanche to add resources, putting 10 people on a fix that would take one coder 10 days doesn’t turn it into a one-day project. Coding doesn’t work that way. “Jeff was a great leader, but there were limits,” says Dickerson. “He would ask us every day if we were going to make the deadline … He’d say how he had to report on how we were doing to the President. And I’d say till I was blue in the face, ‘We’re doing as much as we can as fast as we can, and we’re going to do that no matter what the deadline is.'” One crisis as the November deadline approached gave the team confidence that it could work through anything. Paul Smith, the campaign alumnus Burt had persuaded to join the team just as he was trying to raise money for a startup, had been working on a problem that had stumped everyone so far: the unique identifier that the website had to issue to anyone who was trying to enroll was taking too long to generate. By the afternoon of Nov. 6, the ID generator became so overloaded that the site was effectively down. “This kind of database problem is in basically everything I’ve ever worked on before,” Smith says. “So I worked with the dev team to come up with a patch.” The patch worked in some ways, but the team learned a few days later that the identifications it was generating didn’t have the right number of digits to match insurance companies’ needs. So it had to be removed, and on Nov. 20 the old ID generator effectively shut the website down again. Smith and the team quickly designed a new patch, this time with the right number of digits, and executed what’s called a “hot fix,” meaning they put it onto the site almost instantaneously without testing. It worked. As Dickerson marched his troops through the punch list in November, he added to the team, mostly with recruits he had worked with at Google. Jini Kim, a 32-year-old who had left Google to start her own health care data-analytics service, arrived on Nov. 21 and became the team’s “Queen of Errors.” Her job was to work with a group at a separate office near Dulles Airport in Virginia devoted to dealing with longer-term issues the site would face following the Nov. 30 deadline. The most important of these was scale: Would the site be able to handle the traffic a revived and working HealthCare.gov would, everyone hoped, generate? One of the key issues involved in preparing for that surge was the error rate–the rate at which any click on the site generated a result that it was not supposed to, such as a time-out or the popping up of the wrong page. In October the error rate had been an astoundingly high 6%, meaning that even the lucky few who got on to the site invariably had something go wrong, because at 6%, just 15 or 16 clicks on the site would likely produce a problem. With Thanksgiving falling on Nov. 28, what for most of the country was a long holiday weekend became five days of two-minute drills for the team, all aimed at keeping the President’s promise of a website working for the “vast majority” of visitors by Sunday, Dec. 1. Dozens of items remained on the punch list. For example, people still couldn’t go back a page on the website in certain situations, and the process for comparing competing insurance plans was still too slow. So the releases were pumped out even faster. At the same time, the engineers executed a major upgrade in the hardware powering the system, giving it more capacity and reliability. “You normally don’t do hardware and software changes at the same time,” says Zients. “Because if something breaks you don’t know what the cause is. But we were in a position where we had to take chances.” The rest of the world remained skeptical. On Nov. 13, CMS issued its first report on monthly enrollments, covering the disastrous October rollout. Just 26,794 people had enrolled through the federal exchange over the entire month–90% fewer than what the Administration had been counting on. The night before, the Washington Post website ran a lead story headlined troubled HealthCare.gov unlikely to work fully by end of November. Citing “an official with knowledge of the project,” the Post reported that “government workers and technical contractors racing to repair the Web site have concluded … that the only way for large numbers of Americans to enroll in the health-care plans soon is by using other means so that the online system isn’t overburdened.” After a slew of fixes on Nov. 27, the day before Thanksgiving, and more on Thanksgiving morning, the team went to Park’s house for turkey. Later that night, they returned to the office to execute still more releases while they shared pies brought in by Zients. On Sunday, Dec. 1, Zients issued a public report card showing the website’s turnaround. A series of hardware upgrades had dramatically increased capacity; the system was now able to handle at least 50,000 simultaneous users and probably more. There had been more than 400 bug fixes. Uptimes had gone from an abysmal 43% at the beginning of November to 95%. And Kim and her team had knocked the error rate from 6% down to 0.5%. (By the end of January it would be below 0.5% and still dropping.) The press generally accepted the new numbers but questioned whether the site would be able to handle all the traffic expected ahead of the Dec. 23 deadline for people who wanted coverage effective on Jan. 1. That was what Zients, Park and the rescue crew were worried about too. And yet through December, the numbers kept improving, helped by Kim’s falling error rate and a group of new Dickerson recruits who either parachuted in for stays of a few weeks or, in some cases, vowed to stay until the close of enrollment at the end of March. The team gathered at the command center early on Monday, Dec. 23, to see if what they had rebuilt could handle the traffic crush. “I’ll never forget that day for the rest of my life,” says Park. “We’d been experiencing extraordinary traffic in December, but this was a whole new level of extraordinary … By 9 o’clock traffic was the same as the peak traffic we’d seen in the middle of a busy December day. Then from 9 to 11, the traffic astoundingly doubled. If you looked at the graphs, it looked like a rocket ship.” Traffic rose to 65,000 simultaneous users, then to 83,000, the day’s high point. The result: 129,000 enrollments on Dec. 23, about five times as many in a single day as what the site had handled in all of October. Because the sign-up deadline had been extended until Christmas Eve, Park and the team slept a few hours at the DoubleTree and came back at dawn. Traffic was again at levels never seen until the day before–and produced 93,000 more enrollments. As it got later on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, the band was starting to break up. Smith left early to spend the holiday with his wife and young daughter, whom he had not seen in weeks. Although he lived about 20 miles away in Baltimore, the commute had become an impossible luxury in the frantic weeks in the run-up to the deadline. Before Smith left that night, he gave an impassioned speech about what a privilege it had been to work on the project and to work with this crew, and, says Park, “we all had a hug.” Later that night, Park talked by videophone to Dickerson’s parents in Connecticut, thanking them for lending their son to the team. Just after midnight, Park went home and Dickerson went back to the DoubleTree. He didn’t go back to Google until Jan. 5, spending the days after Christmas helping organize a crew of pit bosses who would cycle in and out of the operations center, which looked calm and whose video dashboards all displayed a remarkably stable system when I was there recently. (One screen showed that the current average response time–once a ridiculous eight seconds per page–was down to 0.343 seconds.) As of its mid-February report covering the period through Jan. 31, CMS says the site had processed 1.9 million enrollments. 5. Where Technology Stops And Policy Begins Challenges remain. A back-end link providing payments and automated account records to insurance companies has yet to be built and might not be completed before summer. But that is mostly a headache for the insurance companies, which have to bill and process payments through spreadsheets; it is not likely to affect consumers’ experience or their access to insurance. Had the Obama team brought in its old campaign hands in the first place to run the launch, there would have been howls about cronyism. But one lesson of the fall and rise of HealthCare.gov has to be that the practice of awarding high-tech, high-stakes contracts to companies whose primary skill seems to be getting those contracts rather than delivering on them has to change. “It was only when they were desperate that they turned to us,” says Dickerson. “I have no history in government contracting and no future in it … I don’t wear a suit and tie … They have no use for someone who looks and dresses like me. Maybe this will be a lesson for them. Maybe that will change.” In the way the team dropped everything to help and then stayed as long as it took, there’s also a lesson about what John Doerr calls “the myth that everyone in Silicon Valley is a selfish narcissist.” In one way or another, every member of the team told me the same thing–that this was the toughest but most rewarding project of their lives. “The two months I spent on this were harder and more intense than the 17 months I spent on the campaign,” says Burt, who like Dickerson initially thought he was going to be working for free. “But I loved every minute of it … I believe in getting people health care. I am so proud of this.” “Jeff was good at pumping us up, and so was Todd,” says one of the team members. “We even got to meet McDonough, the chief of staff, and that was good. But we really didn’t need to be pumped up much. This is what we do. And this job had special meaning.” That may be why none of the group–even those like Dickerson who had worked for President Obama during one or both of the campaigns and had met him multiple times at campaign headquarters–expressed any surprise or regret that they never got to meet the President. “I’m sure he’s got a lot of other things to do,” says Kim, chuckling. Nonetheless, a quick visit from Obama (who spent Thanksgiving 2013 at the White House) to the troops who worked around the clock to save his signature domestic-policy initiative would have seemed fitting. McDonough says that in meetings with the President prior to the launch, Obama always would end each session “by saying, ‘I want to remind the team that this only works if the technology works.'” The problem, of course, was that no one in the meetings had any idea whether the technology worked, nor did the President and his chief of staff have the inclination to dig in and find out. The President may have had the right instinct when he repeatedly reminded his team about the technology. But in the end he was as aloof from the people and facts he needed to avoid this catastrophe as he was from the people who ended up fixing it. Now that it is fixed, the real test of his legacy achievement–what should have been the test all along–will begin. The website works. Will Obamacare work?

Trump Is Trying to End Obamacare in the Middle of a Pandemic ...,7734,"B
etween the protests and the pandemic, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that the Affordable Care Act is still in limbo. But the events of the last week have set the stage for Democrats and Republicans to fight a 2020 rematch of the battle over health care coverage: between the party that giveth, and the party that taketh away. The Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court on June 25 to overturn the law known as Obamacare, joining a group of Republican attorneys general in arguing that Congress effectively made the ACA unconstitutional in 2017 when it zeroed out the individual mandate. The ACA has survived two previous Supreme Court challenges, including a 5-4 ruling upholding the law in 2012, when Chief Justice John Roberts ruled the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress’s power to levy taxes. Now the law faces an existential legal threat for the third time in its 10-year history. “The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate,” Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in the Administration’s brief. The Trump Administration’s challenge to the law comes as the coronavirus pandemic has left more than 120,000 Americans dead and thrown millions off the health care rolls due to lost jobs. If the court decides to overturn the law, the impact would ripple through nearly every part of the U.S. health system. Dismantling the law would worsen racial disparities and make it harder for sick people to get new coverage at a time when COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting Black and Latino Americans and leaving hundreds of thousands with potentially lasting health problems. It would also leave 23 million Americans without health coverage, according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. The Supreme Court has not said when it will hear the ACA case, but oral arguments will likely take place this fall, as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden make their case to voters. Democrats believe Trump’s decision to elevate the fight over health care coverage will play to their advantage, just as it did in the 2018 midterms, when the party recaptured the House of Representatives with the help of Republicans’ attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. “Everybody knows that Trump and the GOP’s attacks on health care were a driving force behind the energy that built the blue wave in 2018. Now Trump is fighting yet again to trash the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a shrug,” says Ezra Levin, co-founder of the liberal grassroots network Indivisible. “We welcome this political malpractice, and it makes it easy for Biden to simply stand against death and destruction—which is, you know, a winning campaign message.” Biden previewed this message in a speech last week in Lancaster, Penn. “Perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition,” Biden said after a roundtable with Pennsylvania voters who said they had benefitted from the Affordable Care Act. He added that that without the ACA, lung scarring and heart damage from COVID-19 could make it difficult for survivors to get future coverage. “They would live their lives caught in a vise between Donald Trump’s twin legacies: his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take health care protections away from American families.” The simplicity of the contrast is a gift to Biden. During the primary, Biden struggled at times articulate a winning message on health care, amid a massive intra-party squabble over whether or not to push for Medicare for All. Now he seems poised to run on the same playbook that helped Democrats win swing states in the midterms: arguing Republicans are trying to take away American’s health care, while he would protect it. Pushing to overturn the ACA has been a Republican goal ever since the law first passed in 2010, and opposition to the health care law fueled the rise of the Tea Party during the Obama presidency. But in recent years, attempts to gut Obamacare have benefited Democrats more than Republicans, as more and more Americans have gotten used to the law’s protections. A June poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 53% of Americans trusted Biden to handle health care policy, compared to just 38% who trusted Donald Trump. One of the reasons that Republicans have historically fought so hard to avoid implementing new social programs is that once a benefit is given to the American people, it becomes very difficult to take it away. While it was initially unpopular, Americans have warmed up to to the Affordable Care Act: by its 10-year anniversary, 55% of Americans viewed Obamacare favorably, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, an all-time high. The pandemic has only underscored its importance. Of the nearly 27 million people who relinquished health insurance when they lost their jobs through early May, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 48% were eligible for coverage through Medicaid, which was expanded under the ACA, and another 31% were eligible for subsidies to help them afford new plans on the marketplace. People have been taking advantage of these options. The Trump Administration’s brief came the same day as a report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that showed 487,000 Americans bought insurance by using the special enrollment period that opens when individuals lose their health coverage, and most states that run their own marketplaces have also created new COVID-19 special enrollment periods to allow more people to get covered. Without the ACA, fewer people would be eligible for coverage through Medicaid and many more low- and middle-income families would struggle to buy insurance. Protections for those with pre-existing conditions would disappear, as would requirements that insurance companies sell to anyone who wants it and charge the same price to anyone who buys similar insurance. All of this would be worse for people of color. The ACA significantly narrowed racial and ethnic coverage gaps in the years after it was passed, though gains slowed when Trump was elected in 2016. But now that Black, Hispanic and Native Americans are dying and being hospitalized from COVID-19 at higher rates than white Americans, doctors have emphasized that health coverage is more important than ever. “Trump’s deadly move comes at a time when there is still so much work left to do. The Trump Administration’s own data this week showed that Black Americans are four times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19. That confirms long standing disparities we all were aware of,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the group of Democratic states fighting to preserve the ACA, told reporters on June 24. “Now is not the time to rip away our best tool to address very real and very deadly health disparities in our communities.” Republicans have not put forward their own alternative health care plan to replace the ACA. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the Administration would protect those with preexisting conditions but that specifics were still up in the air. “The exact details will be dependent on the—frankly, the composition of Congress if and when the Supreme Court does strike down all or a large part of Obamacare,” Azar said. But voters don’t respond well to plans to take away Americans’ health care without a concrete plan to replace it. They may balk even more during a global pandemic. And Biden will make sure voters don’t forget which party is fighting to gut health care coverage, and which side is fighting to protect it.","JUNE 29, 2020"
Survey Ranks the U.S. Health Care System Lowest in Performance ...,2033,"T
he U.S. health care system has been subject to heated debate over the past decade, but one thing that has remained consistent is the level of performance, which has been ranked as the worst among industrialized nations for the fifth time, according to the 2014 Commonwealth Fund survey 2014. The U.K. ranked best with Switzerland following a close second. The Commonwealth Fund report compares the U.S. with 10 other nations: France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K. were all judged to be superior based on various factors. These include quality of care, access to doctors and equity throughout the country. Results of the study rely on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Health Organization and interviews from physicians and patients. Although the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world, the nation ranks lowest in terms of “efficiency, equity and outcomes,” according to the report. One of the most piercing revelations is that the high rate of expenditure for insurance is not commensurate to the satisfaction of patients or quality of service. High out-of-pocket costs and gaps in coverage “undermine efforts in the U.S. to improve care coordination,” the report summarized. A striking take-home from the report was a need for equity throughout the nation. “Disparities in access to services signal the need to expand insurance to cover the uninsured and to ensure that all Americans have an accessible medical home,” it said. A lack of universal health care was noted as the key difference between the U.S. and the other industrial nations. Despite these shortcomings, positives noted include the breadth of reforms spearheaded by the Affordable Care Act, including new databases for transparent information and financial assistance for low-middle-income families in gaining coverage. “Those efforts will likely help clinicians deliver more effective and efficient care,” the report concludes.","JUNE 17, 2014"
Coronavirus Is Helping Fix China's Broken Healthcare System | Time,7414,"W
hen Dai Yufan began developing a fever and painful cyst, her first thought was to see a doctor. But due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visiting her local hospital seemed scarier than her symptoms. “So I tried an online health service,” says Dai, 27, an office worker in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. “I asked about my condition via an app and [a doctor online] suggested some medicine and other treatments.” While the coronavirus has stretched medical services around the world to breaking point, the virus has also fostered a boom in online medical services, known as telehealth. The industry is predicted to be worth almost $30 billion this year in China alone and has the potential to transform Chinese healthcare by reducing strain on urban hospitals and providing a stop-gap solution for rural dwellers. China already has over 1,000 telehealth companies, according to data firm Tianyancha, including some run by tech giants JD.com, Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba. Dai used the Good Doctor subsidiary of Ping An Insurance, which claimed in September to have 300 million registered users. All are seeing a boom in consultations due to lockdown measures. Before the pandemic, JD Health took 10,000 online consultations per day. But as hospitals and clinics became swamped with suspected coronavirus patients, that has rocketed to 150,000, with JD Health’s own pharmacy delivering medicines directly to patients’ homes. Xin Lijun, CEO of the $7 billion-valued company, says the convenience of telehealth will remain attractive after the crisis abates. “People have developed the habit of getting diagnosis and treatment online,” Xin tells TIME. “This greatly reduces the pressure on traditional hospitals.” China’s healthcare system has made vast strides over the past few decades. Public sector spending on health care increased almost 14-fold between the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the end of 2018, according a March 2019 report by the WHO and World Bank. Nearly every Chinese citizen has some level of health insurance, with patients contributing an average of 32% of their treatment costs compared with 60% a decade ago. But problems persist, especially as a severely aging population increases demand for treating chronic conditions such as arthritis, cancer and heart disease. China has only 1.8 doctors for every 1,000 people, compared with 2.4 in the U.S. and 2.8 in the U.K. Compounding matters, China’s doctors are unevenly weighted towards specialties to the detriment of primary care. While the U.S. has a dozen family doctors for every 10,000 citizens, China has just 2.2, meaning specialists at Chinese hospitals are overburdened with general duties. Chinese patients typically queue up for many hours at highly ranked hospitals even for minor aliments but remain suspicious of underutilized local clinics. According to the WHO and World Bank report, China’s healthcare is too “hospital-centric, fragmented, and volume driven.” The system is also becoming too expensive to sustain, with healthcare costs growing 5-10% faster than GDP. Online consultancies can help solve many of these issues, explaining why so many companies are aggressively exploring the space. Baidu Health boasts over 100,000 doctors from across China who offer online consultations 24 hours a day. The platform was made free to those with pneumonia symptoms during the pandemic and had handled over 54.5 million enquiries by Apr. 26, including 400,000 from outside China. It’s also a boon for China’s overworked and underpaid doctors, who are able to supplement their income via online services. Dr. Qiao Guibin, director of Thoracic Surgery at Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, works for Baidu Health part-time. By encouraging patients to stay at home during the pandemic, online healthcare also reduces the chances of cross-infection of both patients and doctors. “Online medical treatment may have saved a lot of lives during the pandemic,” says Qiao. And not just in China. Qiao even treated a patient in Canada who had contracted COVID-19. “He was very anxious at first,” say Qiao. “But I reassured him that as a young man he shouldn’t worry too much, because 80% of people do not need medicine and COVID-19 [as a viral disease] is self-healing.” Qiao checked in with the patient daily during his quarantine and heard a few days ago that he had completely recovered. “He is very grateful.” There are also mental health benefits for patients isolated from friends and family due to lockdown measures. When Cai Anqi, 23, a public health student in London, developed a fever she naturally worried it might be COVID-19. However, the U.K. government’s guidelines were simply to self-quarantine unless her symptoms severely worsened. Wracked with worry, she instead turned to China’s telehealth provider WeDoctor. “I described my condition: fever, dizziness, and runny nose, but without a cough. The doctor’s advice was to rest more, eat nutritious food, drink more water. She said as long as I don’t cough, it should be fine, as a cough is the main symptom of COVID-19. After her professional advice, I didn’t panic so much. After a few days following the doctor’s advice, the fever was gone.” The U.S. is also trying to boost the sector in response to the pandemic. In March, President Trump advocated waiving certain federal rules to allow doctors to provide care remotely using video chats and other services. “What they’ve done with telehealth is incredible,” Trump said. Across the U.S., telehealth provider Amwell has seen an increase in patient volumes of around 150-300% generally and up 700% during the early days of the outbreak in Washington State. Some individual hospitals have increased demand for Amwell’s services 20-fold in an effort to shield front line medical workers. Amwell CEO Roy Schoenberg says telehealth has proved particularly valuable in “geographic care deserts” and for elderly patients with mobility issues. “We see this application of the technology as critical for democratizing healthcare and ensuring that all in need of care can access it, during COVID-19 and in the future,” he tells TIME. Telehealth also allows patients to choose doctors based on their experience and patient reviews. Dr. Liu Yafeng has 18 years’ experience working as a gastroenterologist in China’s Hebei province, where he also ran the local hospital’s oncology and ICU departments. But while he might handle 30 consultations a day at a bricks and mortar hospital, he can manage about 200 online. It cost just 10 renminbi ($1.40) for an online consultations via JD Health or 15 renminbi ($2.10) for a 15 minute voice consultation. Liu has made 15,154 online diagnoses since joining the firm, with a 99% patient satisfaction rate. “I get a greater sense of accomplishment because of all the positive feedback I receive from patients,” he says. Still, significant challenges remain: “The biggest challenge of telehealth comes from diagnosis, which often requires specialist equipment,” says Liu. “It is an emerging industry and may take a long time to solve this problem.” The concerns are echoed by the patient, Dai. “I will still use the online health service after the pandemic, but I don’t think I trust online doctors’ diagnosis quite as much as a proper consultation,” she says. “I still feel distant from the online doctor. After all, he doesn’t know all my problems.” —With reporting by Zhang Chi/Beijing","MAY 6, 2020"
Fix Our Mental Healthcare System to Save Young LGBTQ Lives | Time,6925,"T
o say that the past year has been challenging is an understatement. The pandemic completely uprooted people’s lives and left many grappling with more fear and uncertainty than ever before—bringing conversations around mental health to the national stage. Yet, marginalized groups who have long faced disparities in the mental healthcare system like LGBTQ youth —especially those who are transgender and people of color—are still too often left out of the conversation. It was recently reported that overall suicides in the U.S. declined in 2020, but preliminary studies suggest these rates may have actually increased among people of color. LGBTQ youth also face disparities in mental health outcomes. According to new research from The Trevor Project, the suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth that I lead, 42% of LGBTQ youth, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth, seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, and that percentage only increases for youth of color. Yet, nearly half of all LGBTQ youth could not access the mental health care they desired. There are very real, tangible steps we can take to end the mental health crisis among LGBTQ youth, but in order to get there, we need to implement stronger, intersectional data collection and use it as a basis to spark structural change across our mental healthcare system. How can we identify and meet the needs of LGBTQ youth if we don’t have data that illuminates the true state of their mental health and suicide risk? The fact is very little research exists on LGBTQ youth, and the research that does exist has historically conflated all LGBTQ people, examining their experiences as one homogenous group. By taking an intersectional approach to data collection and uncoupling various groups within the community we can see data in a more meaningful and productive way. This ultimately helps us better understand the distinct experiences of LGBTQ people with different backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender identities, cultures, races, and ethnicities. PAID PARTNER CONTENT BY CHINA DAILY In an effort to establish this more sophisticated research, The Trevor Project recently conducted its third annual National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, capturing the experiences of nearly 35,000 LGBTQ young people ages 13-24. With 45% being youth of color and more than 38% transgender or nonbinary youth, this is our most diverse sample yet. We know that LGBTQ youth with multiple marginalized identities face unique stigma and stressors. In particular, LGBTQ youth who are Black and/or transgender have had to grapple with a hostile political climate and repeated acts of racist and transphobic violence over the last year. Most recently, The Trevor Project has been fighting back against an onslaught of anti-trans legislation across the country that threatens to restrict trans youth’s rights to receive best-practice, gender-affirming medical care, participate in school sports, and use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. And our research shows that structural racism and increased experiences of discrimination contribute to suicide risk and gaps in access to care. For instance, out of the LGBTQ youth we surveyed this year, 12% of white youth attempted suicide compared to 31% of Native/Indigenous youth, 21% of Black youth, 21% of multiracial youth, 18% of Latinx youth, and 12% of Asian/Pacific Islander youth. Further, our research finds that LGBTQ youth who experienced more types of discrimination were at higher risk for having attempted suicide in the past year. While it’s imperative that we continue to spotlight the mental health challenges LGBTQ young people have long-faced and advocate for more robust data collection, it’s also important to acknowledge the steps we can take on the individual level to make a positive impact and save young lives, such as advocating for LGBTQ-affirming spaces and practices. LGBTQ youth who have access to spaces that affirm their sexual orientation and gender identity report lower rates of suicide attempts. While nearly 7 in 10 LGBTQ youth report having access to affirming spaces online, only half reported that their school was LGBTQ-affirming and only 1 in 3 found their home to be LGBTQ-affirming. We must create safe, affirming environments in the spaces where LGBTQ youth spend most of their time. And despite efforts on the state-level to go backwards on transgender rights, our research underscores that trans-inclusive policies and practices help save young lives. Among trans and nonbinary youth, respecting their pronouns and allowing them to change their name and/or gender marker on legal documents were both associated with lower rates of attempting suicide. Additionally, schools, public health officials, and all youth-serving mental health organizations must utilize an intersectional lens in developing programs and services to meet the specific needs of different communities. We also desperately need systemic change to ensure that all youth have access to mental health care. As it stands, our mental healthcare system is not serving everyone equally, and oftentimes, the youth who need and want mental health care the most aren’t able to receive it. In the long term, policymakers must prioritize expanding access to public-funded mental health programs and culturally competent providers. This includes incentivizing the recruitment of a more robust mental health workforce that better reflects the diversity of our country’s young people and actively engaging community stakeholders who have lived experience before offering response strategies aimed at benefiting their communities. In the short term, we need to continue investing in emerging technologies like telehealth and digital therapeutics that lower costs and help break down long-standing barriers to care like geographic disparities. States across the country should also develop licensing policies that allow mental health providers to treat youth under 18 without parental permission and across state lines. Significant progress was made on this front during COVID-19 as more and more people leaned into digital health, but we need to adopt and expand these solutions long-term so that all LGBTQ youth, regardless of where they live and who they live with, can access the affirming care they need. Establishing a mental health care system that is equitable and effective will not be simple—it will require robust public funding and a wide variety of policy changes aimed at eliminating structural barriers. However, these changes are long overdue and could have a crucial impact on saving young LGBTQ lives. And on an individual level, we must all work together to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive policies, programs, and practices, while actively confronting mental health stigma and helping to reduce fears around asking for help.","JULY 23, 2021"
Who Gets to Count as a Health Care Expert? | Time,8846,"A
mericans are emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic like survivors of a wildfire surveying an unfamiliar landscape. As we take stock of what’s left, we are forced to rebuild, but we need not simply restore what was taken in a hollow echo of what we knew before. We can make health care and the infrastructure that supports it better, stronger, more resilient. To do that, as we learned at great cost over the past 15 months, we must value all the stakeholders in the system: not just insurance executives and hospital CEOs, but patients, disabled people, older adults, low-income people, people of color who have faced historic health care discrimination, and health care workers and supporters, from home health aides to hospital registrars. Millions of Americans interact with the health care system every year—if and when they can afford it. But discussions about health care reform often leave out some of these voices. Policy-makers, industry executives, hospital officials and others in high-status positions hear from others in similar roles, or from prominent members of the health care community like sought-after specialists who bring in high-value patients. Under-represented in these conversations are those who know the system at its worst, like ambulance crews making minimum wage, nurses in underfunded community health clinics and uninsured patients who know what it’s like to halve their insulin dose to stretch to the next paycheck. The devaluation of these members of the health care community is paradoxically what makes their voices so important: those who are considered lowest in status often have the best observations about the systems they are trapped in. Two groups of stakeholders were particularly vocal and active during the pandemic: nurses and disabled people. While communities banged pots and cheered, hospitals hung heroes work here banners and the media trumpeted about “essential workers,” many nurses were laboring in conditions that didn’t have to be so dangerous. Nurses are on the front line of patient care, on shift for hours with their assigned patients, unlike physicians, technicians and other providers who typically see patients briefly for tests or assessments. Nursing work can be grinding and emotionally exhausting, and nurses often know their patients and their families best, seeing elements of the health care system that others may be oblivious to. Yet these medical professionals are often not afforded the respect given to doctors. During the pandemic, though, the nation had no choice but to hear the collective voice of nurses everywhere. Hospital by hospital, nurses worked together to make themselves and their patients safer, even if it meant wearing garbage bags as PPE, as some had to do in New York City—forcing those in charge to confront the reality that we were ill-prepared for a national public-health catastrophe. And as nurses rapidly adopted technology to allow for remote patient visits, too many of which ended with families saying goodbye via video chat, they reminded the health care community that patient care isn’t just about physical health. Buy a print of TIME’s We Will Never Be the Same Cover here The disability community, including a broad swath of people from those with chronic illnesses to wheelchair users to mentally ill people, makes up roughly 26% of the U.S. population. While the term professional patient is sometimes used in a derogatory way, it accurately describes many people who regularly interact with the health care system. They are, by nature of their health care needs, extremely familiar with the ins and outs of the system, including the problematic elements. During the pandemic, some organized around hashtags like #HighRiskCA, which was used to call out the way California’s vaccine-distribution system, in the first phase of the rollout, left out disabled people who did not meet its 65-plus age requirement but were highly vulnerable to COVID-19. Furthermore, through a partnership between the Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center and the Center for Dignity in Healthcare for People With Disabilities, a team that included disabled researchers set up a Vaccine Prioritization Dashboard to track how states were handling disability eligibility for vaccines and help disabled people navigate incredibly confusing guidance. The disabled researchers drew upon their own experiences and fears in developing an accessible, clear product to help the community, filling a gap in the public-health outreach system. We should not just cheer these examples as cases where some often overlooked people happened to offer something useful during a disaster; we should see them as a road map for the future. As we move forward, we should use the knowledge and skills of nurses, disabled people, health care coordinators and myriad others to build the health care system we deserve. Those people need to be represented in the rooms where policy is developed, including among legislatures, advocacy groups and other entities that push policy priorities. People interested in health care reform should actively seek out these voices: to learn more about how to advocate for what people actually need, and to figure out what questions to ask those in power. When people raise issues that make advocates uncomfortable, it’s necessary to lean into that discomfort and use it as an opportunity to do better. People with extensive experience in the health care landscape have critiques that may improve proposals to fix it. Consider the notion of a government-funded single-payer health care system. Many Americans, as much as 36% based on a 2020 Pew survey, say they support such a program, but the public conversation on this topic does not clearly define what such a plan would look like, and it’s been muddled by conflicting proposals. Although people without experience in the health care space may think it’s as simple as needing care and getting it paid for by the government, disabled people want answers to questions that, to others, might seem in the weeds but are actually critical to everyone, such as how prescription benefits would be covered, or what happens when a costly test or procedure is recommended but a patient doesn’t meet strict criteria. We are emerging from a hard-fought war against an invisible enemy and we know the current system is broken, but if we leave out the voices of people in the know when we fix it, whatever we develop may not be an improvement, but rather, the same problems in a new package. As post–World War II Japan slowly began its economic recovery and manufacturing began to bloom, Toyota introduced the Andon cord: a literal cord that anyone on the production line could pull to pause production to address a safety or quality issue. The prospect of allowing anyone to bring a multimillion-dollar process to a halt may sound wild, but it turned out to be highly effective, making everyone into an experienced stakeholder, no matter the nature of the task they were performing. The Andon played a role in the culture turnaround of the NUMMI auto-manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif., which had a toxic and unproductive work environment until the mid-1980s, when Toyota and GM began jointly operating it using Toyota’s manufacturing processes. Empowering workers with the Andon proved successful in improving morale and increasing buy-in. The U.S. health care system as a whole needs a metaphorical Andon cord. It’s something we know works in health care settings, as some facilities use similar safety checks to protect patients and providers—one of which is “Stop the Line,” which can be called by anyone to stop and address a safety concern or other issue such as the wrong medication or improper use of equipment. The point is, the real expert is not always the foreman or the team lead, the prestigious surgeon or the person with the broad, big-picture view. Sometimes it’s someone on the assembly line, or it’s the hospital orderly who cleans rooms between patients. A physical plant worker can have a sharp idea for more safely sealing doors. An intern reading about right-to-repair laws can fight to get sidelined ventilators up and running. We may not know when the next pandemic will strike, but we do know that everyone needs health care, and the system needs to be much more robust the next time a new virus or mass-casualty event happens. Repairing America’s health care system requires the humility to recognize expertise no matter where it comes from, and the ability to integrate stakeholders into the process as early as possible. If we truly want everyone in the U.S. to have access to high-quality, safe, equitable, compassionate health care, we must stop to value everyone who’s embedded in the system. smith is a National Magazine Award–winning essayist and journalist    ","JUNE 10, 2021"
Unequal Access to Health Care Costs Us All | Time,7826,"A
mericans spend vast sums on health care. Certainly, health care is expensive all over the world, and it makes good sense for rich countries to spend large amounts to extend their citizens’ lives and to reduce pain and suffering. But America does this about as badly as it is possible to imagine. Health care can sometimes harm people, through medical mistakes, or the overprescription of opioids. But there is also harm to people’s lives from its extraordinary and unnecessary costs. The percentage of national income that is absorbed by health care has grown over the past half-century, from 5% in 1960 to 18% in 2017, reducing what is available for anything else from 95% in 1960 to 82% today. The costs of health care contribute to the long-term stagnation in wages; to fewer good jobs, especially for less educated workers; and to rising income inequality. The U.S. health care system spent $10,739 per person in 2017, about five times what the country spends on defense and about three times what it spends on education. High costs inflate the earnings of many providers and make the industry unnecessarily large. The cost of employer-provided health insurance, largely invisible to employees, not only holds down wages but also destroys jobs, especially for less skilled workers, and replaces good jobs with worse jobs at lower wages. Health care costs directly hurt those without insurance, while those who are insured must pay co-payments, deductibles and employee contributions. Health costs also affect federal and state governments, which pay for Medicare and Medicaid. Governments must collect more taxes; provide less of something else, such as infrastructure or public education; or run deficits that shift the burden to future taxpayers. We could cut back costs by at least a third without compromising our health. American health care is the most expensive in the world, and yet American health is among the worst among rich countries. The chart accompanying this story shows life expectancy and health expenditure per capita from 1970 to 2017. It highlights just how far off course the U.S. has drifted. The U.S. has lower life expectancy than the other wealthy countries but vastly higher expenditures per person. In 1970, the countries were not very far apart, with American life expectancy not much worse and expenditures not much higher, but other countries have seen faster improvements in health and slower increases in costs. In 2017, the Swiss lived 5.1 years longer than Americans but spent 30% less per person; other countries achieved a similar length of life for still fewer health dollars. If a fairy godmother were to reduce the share of health care in American GDP to Switzerland’s, 5.6% of our GDP (or more than a trillion dollars) would be available for other things. That is more than $3,000 a year for each person in the U.S., or about $8,300 per household. If each household had been given an additional $8,300 in 2017, median income growth over the past 30 years would have been double what it actually was. These very large numbers are just the waste of health care. America is a rich country, and it makes sense for Americans to pay for more and better health care. Yet Americans do not use more of most medical services compared with other countries’ citizens. Americans do seem to have a more luxurious system—business rather than coach, as it were—but as with business and coach passengers, everyone reaches their destination at the same time. How is it possible that Americans pay so much and get so little? The money is certainly going somewhere. What is waste to a patient is income to a provider. The industry is not very good at promoting health, but it excels at promoting wealth among health care providers, including some successful private physicians who operate profitable practices. Physicians are the largest single occupation among the top 1% of incomes. The industry also delivers vast sums to the owners and executives of pharmaceutical companies, to medical-device manufacturers, to insurers and to large, ever more monopolistic hospitals. Much of the difference in costs compared with those of other countries comes from vastly higher prices. American doctors get paid almost twice as much as the average doctor in other wealthy countries. The effect on costs is limited because the U.S. also has fewer doctors per capita—physician-led groups have been effective in holding salaries up by holding down the number of places in medical schools, and by excluding well-qualified foreign doctors. In a private health-insurance system like that in the U.S., insurance companies, doctors’ offices and hospitals spend huge sums on administration. In a single-payer system, more than half of these costs would be eliminated. Last, consolidation of hospitals reduces competition and raises the prices that insurers pay to cover patients; hospitals are more profitable and patients pay more for their health care. Half of all non-elderly Americans (about 158 million people) have health insurance through an employer. Employer-provided insurance is typically well liked by those who are covered, although it is not without costs for the employee. On average, employees in 2017 paid about $1,200 (18%) of the cost of an individual policy, or $5,700 (29%) of a family policy. They also pay health-related taxes, and they have to meet co-payments at the time of treatment, as well as deductibles. Many employees think employer contributions—the other 71% of the (average) $20,000 family policy—are free to them. Yet they are not free to the firm, and they affect how much firms are prepared to pay in wages and how many workers they employ. For an employer, it is not the wage that matters but rather what the firm has to pay to hire the worker, including the costs of health insurance and other benefits. Employees may think they are being given a gift, little realizing that what their employers care about is the total they pay, not to whom they pay it. The employee “gift” is being deducted, partially or fully, from wages. Worse still, employers faced with large increases in health premiums may eliminate jobs or outsource work to firms that pay less and provide fewer benefits. Insurance works only when sick and healthy people are pooled together, in America by employment, and in other rich countries by government fiat across the whole population. Without subsidies for those with low incomes, and without some guarantee that everyone is always in the system, insurance cannot work. Leaving health care to the market leaves many uninsured. Americans like to believe that their system is a free-market one, in spite of the fact that the government is paying half of the cost, is paying the prices demanded by pharmaceutical companies without negotiation, is permitting professional associations to restrict supply, and is subsidizing employer-provided health care through the tax system. The historical accident of employer-based coverage is a huge barrier to reform. So is the way that the health care industry is protected in Washington by its lobbyists—five for every member of Congress. Our government is complicit in an extortion that is an important contributor to income inequality in America today. Through pharma companies that get rich by addicting people, and through excessive costs that lower wages and eliminate good jobs, the industry that is supposed to improve our health is undermining it.

Overspecialized doctors make for expensive and sloppy healthcare ...,5652,"N
ot long ago, a primary-care physician called me about a patient with a right-lung “consolidation” — probably pneumonia, though a tumor could not be excluded — that a lung specialist had decided to biopsy. My colleague wanted me to provide “cardiac clearance” for the procedure. “Sure, I’ll see him,” I said, sitting in my office. “How old is he?” “Ninety-two.” I stopped what I was doing. “Ninety-two? And they want to do a biopsy?” My colleague, who is from Nigeria, started laughing. “What can I tell you? In my country we would leave him alone, but this is America, my friend.” Though accurate data is lacking, the overuse of health care services in this country probably costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year out of the $3 trillion that Americans spend on health. This overuse is driven by many forces: “defensive” medicine by doctors trying to avoid lawsuits, a reluctance on the part of doctors and patients to accept diagnostic uncertainty (thus leading to more tests), lack of consensus about which treatments are effective, and the pervading belief that newer, more expensive drugs and technology are better. However, perhaps the most important factor is the overspecialization of the American physician workforce and the high frequency with which these specialists are called by primary-care physicians for help. The past half-century has witnessed great changes in American medicine. One of the biggest shifts is the rise of specialists. In 1940, three-quarters of America’s physicians were general practitioners. By 1960 specialists outnumbered generalists, and by 1970 only a quarter of doctors counted themselves general practitioners. This increase paralleled an equally dramatic rise in medical expenses, from $3 billion in 1940 to $75 billion in 1970. Specialist-driven care has now become a fact of medical practice. In the past decade, the probability that a visit to a physician resulted in a referral to a specialist has nearly doubled, from 5% to more than 9%. Referral rates to specialists are estimated to be at least twice as high in the U.S. as in Britain. The consequences for patients are troubling. Besides high costs, having too many consultants leads to sloppiness and disorganization. As Drs. Donald Berwick and Allan Detsky recently wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association, inpatient care at hospitals has become a relay race for physicians and consultants, and patients are the batons. I remember a 50-year-old patient of my Nigerian colleague who was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. During his monthlong stay, which probably cost upward of $100,000, he was seen by a hematologist; an endocrinologist; a kidney specialist; a podiatrist; two cardiologists; a cardiac electrophysiologist; an infectious-disease specialist; a pulmonologist; an ear, nose and throat specialist; a urologist; a gastroenterologist; a neurologist; a nutritionist; a general surgeon; a thoracic surgeon; and a pain specialist. The man underwent 12 procedures, including cardiac catheterization, a pacemaker implant and a bone-marrow biopsy (to investigate only mild anemia). Every day he was in the hospital, his insurance company probably got billed nearly $1,000 for doctor visits alone. When he was discharged (with only minimal improvement in his shortness of breath), follow-up visits were scheduled for him with seven specialists. This case — in which expert consultations sprouted with little rhyme, reason or coordination — reinforced a lesson I learned many times in my first year as an attending physician: in our health care system, if you have a slew of specialists and a willing patient, almost any sort of terrible excess can occur. What to do about this overspecialization? One option is accountable-care organizations, an idea put forward by the Affordable Care Act, in which teams of doctors would be responsible (and paid accordingly) for their patients’ clinical outcomes. This would force specialists to coordinate care. Unfortunately, most doctors, notoriously independent and already smothered in paperwork, have generally performed poorly in this regard. Reforms will also have to focus on patient education. Medical specialty societies recently released lists of tests and procedures that are not beneficial to patients. By using these lists, cardiologists have been able to decrease their use of imaging tests by 20%. Better-informed patients might be the most potent restraint on overspecialized care. A large percentage of health care costs is a consequence of induced demand — that is, physicians persuading patients to consume services they would not have chosen had they been better educated. If patients were more involved in medical decisionmaking, there would be more constraints on doctors’ behavior, decreasing the possibility of unnecessary testing. This could serve as a potent check on what the doctor ordered. Today roughly 1 of 6 dollars spent in America goes toward health care. If we do not succeed in controlling these costs, they will gradually crowd out other necessary societal expenditures. Improving health literacy will be critical to these efforts. Without a better understanding of what doctors are actually doing, one may end up like the patient who had 17 consultants and 12 procedures and who reinforced a further lesson I have learned many times since entering practice: when too many specialists are involved in a case, the result too often is waste, disorganization and overload.

The Jobs With The Worst Obesity Rates Include Healthcare | Time,1816,"I
t turns out jobs in public administration, utilities, and health care and social service have some of the highest populations of obese employees. A new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine analyzed data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey to determine Americans’ weight, height, occupation and general stress on the job. The researchers found that employees who worked over 40 hours a week or worked in a hostile work environments were significantly more likely to be obese. People working in protective service, like cops and security guards were the most likely to be obese. But more surprising industries like health care had high numbers of obese workers as well, likely due to high stress and long hours. The study found that those who worked in healthcare customer service and support were far more likely to be obese than actual health care practitioners, suggesting, it said, “that the impact of working conditions on obesity may be especially harmful for lower-income workers.” The researchers say jobs with long hours can lower workers’ opportunities to get exercise, and jobs with high levels of stress are associated with eating unhealthy and consuming more calories in general. Shift workers often deal with chronic stress, which can have biological effects on the body that contribute to obesity. Since many employers are looking for ways to cut costs related to health care, knowing what type of work environments can impact obesity levels is valuable. Here are the top 10 industries with the highest numbers of obese workers: 1. Public administration 2. Utilities 3. Information 4. Transportation and warehousing 5. Healthcare and social assistance 6.

The US Should Vaccinate Every Health Care Worker Worldwide | Time,5431,"A
s the United States seems close to controlling a pandemic that has killed 600,000 Americans, we must recognize that in much of the rest of the world, the pandemic continues to rage. Now, with the U.S. vaccine supply far outstripping our domestic needs, the U.S. is taking action, with President Biden’s announcement of the first major global distribution of American vaccine doses. But there are billions of vulnerable people around the world, and at current vaccination rates many will be waiting a long time for a shot. Health care workers around the globe should not be left waiting. As its first major global vaccination intervention, the U.S. should aim to vaccinate the world’s health care workers, urgently exporting doses both to the Gavi, World Health Organization and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations’ COVAX facility and, through bilateral partnerships, to other nations. There are moral, humanitarian and practical reasons for focusing on health care workers. First, the moral reasons: These workers are highly exposed to infection, particularly during viral surges; unlike most other work, there is little these workers can do to reduce their exposure to people actively sick with COVID-19. In fact, while other front-line workers do face risks, health care workers spend all their days with patients with this disease. With high-quality PPE and rapid diagnostics in short supply, these workers face some of the highest risks of getting infected, getting sick and dying. Across the world, more than 115,000 health care workers have died from COVID-19 and millions have been sickened by the disease. They deserve, for moral reasons alone, our strongest protection. Second, there are humanitarian reasons that affect entire populations. When health care workers get sick and die, health systems break down, undermining the capacity to treat not just COVID-19 but any disease, dramatically increasing bad outcomes for everyone, including children. The health of everyone depends on the ability of health care workers to do their jobs. Once a health system is strained with a lack of health care workers, the ability of the system to do the basics – care for people with common conditions, help women deliver babies, or manage patients’ chronic conditions – begins to collapse. Everyone’s suffering rises exponentially, not just those with COVID-19. And the health threat posed by COVID-19 infections in health care workers has long-term implications. Ebola outbreaks in West Africa exacted a terrible cost on the health care workforce, undermining health of the people of those nations for a generation. Indeed, when other things are in short supply in health care, such as medicines or oxygen, they can be replenished relatively quickly. The loss of health care workers takes a generation or even longer to replenish. The costs on society in terms of poor health will last for decades. Finally, there are just plain practical reasons. This is a group that the U.S. alone can vaccinate in the upcoming weeks, if not months. The World Bank conservatively estimates that there are 50 million health care workers in the world, while the WHO counts millions more. Many of them have already been vaccinated (as in the U.S., the U.K and Israel) and others will be soon (as in the E.U., Russia and China). This likely leaves 30 to 40 million health care workers outside these countries that are vulnerable. We have more than enough vaccines to immunize this group immediately. And unlike other high-risk groups, where there is some disagreement about who exactly is high risk, front-line health care workers are relatively easy to identify, allowing us to move efficiently. Read more: Inside the Facilities Making the World’s Most Prevalent COVID-19 Vaccine The U.S. should announce it will ensure that every health care worker in the world will be able to get their first shot within the next month. For countries where we have strong relationships, we can work with their ministries of health to identify and vaccinate front-line health care workers. For others, we could work with WHO and its facility COVAX. WHO has already prioritized health care workers in its public approach, although they often lump them in with other high-risk groups, which balloons the number of eligible people to more than 1 billion. The key here is to keep it simple: focus on front-line health care workers and work with WHO to get vaccines distributed and into the arms of health care workers. Does the U.S. really have this many doses to spare? Absolutely. The US is getting around 20 million doses of vaccines every week from its contracts – and using about 10 million. More important, it has 72 million doses already distributed to states. The U.S. will easily have more than 100 million more doses than it can use by the end of June. If we start sending vaccine doses now, not a single American will be denied a dose if they want one. Time is of the essence. The variants are spreading and infecting health care workers around the world. The costs to these workers is immense, and the costs to those societies is even higher. The United States has the capacity to transform the dynamics of infection without jeopardizing its own recovery; the only question is whether we have the courage and will to show this kind of global leadership. My colleagues in India, Argentina and elsewhere – and their patients – hope that we do.","UPDATED: JUNE 6,"

Donald Trump Just Praised Australia's Universal Health Care | Time,1141,"P
resident Donald Trump praised Australia’s universal health care system Thursday, telling Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that, “you have better healthcare than we do.” Trump’s comments, made during a joint press conference with Turnbull in New York, came shortly after the GOP’s second attempt at a health care reform bill was narrowly passed by the Republican-controlled House. The bill, designed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, now faces a tough audience in the Senate, where some GOP lawmakers are hesitant to support the measure before their re-election bids. Critics say the current version is likely to significantly reduce coverage and cost medical workers jobs. Senator Bernie Sanders laughed out loud when he heard Trump’s comment to Turnbull. “The President has just said it, that’s great,” Sanders told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “Let us move to a medicare for all system that does what every major country on earth does: guarantee health care to all people at a fraction of the cost per capita,” Sanders said. “Thank you Mr. President, we’ll quote you on the floor of the senate.”","MAY 4, 2017"
'I'm Mentally and Physically Exhausted.' Healthcare Workers Battling ...,8796,"A
t the Southeast Florida emergency room where 62-year-old nurse Penny Blake works, hospital administrators put gloves, cleaning supplies, and N-95 masks behind lock and key because people were stealing them. Twelve hundred miles away, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, N-95 masks, which are only supposed to be worn for up to eight hours, are so scarce that doctors are keeping them in their lockers. “Once you get one, the feeling is you keep it for as long as you can,” said Dr. Michelle Lin. In more than a dozen interviews with TIME, medical professionals from California to New York painted a picture of scarce resources, growing anxieties, and frustrations with hospital administrators and the government for failing to adequately prepare. Chief among their concerns was the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, gowns and eye gear. With more than 43,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States so far, a lack of this gear means they face a high risk of exposure to the virus—which, in turn, means accidentally exposing other patients, their own families, and their colleagues at a time when hospitals cannot afford to have critical personnel on the sidelines. “The biggest concern we have is that we will not have enough personal protective equipment to take care of the number of patients that are coming in,” says Blake. “And if we can’t protect ourselves, then we’re not going to be able to be there for them.” Dr. Matthew Baldwin, a critical care physician and pulmonary specialist at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Hospital says he expects the problem to get worse from here. “We’ve had an exponential increase in the number of patients that have come into hospital and have been hospitalized in the last 48 hours,” he told TIME on March 21. “I think there’s genuine concern now, that in the near future, we will run out of personal protective equipment.” In recent weeks, governors, mayors and public health officials have begged President Donald Trump to address shortages in medical equipment, but they’ve received conflicting messages. On March 18, Trump signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, a 70-year-old law that authorizes presidents to compel American companies to prioritize federal government orders to produce equipment necessary to protect national security over other orders. By March 24, FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor told CNN the law would be used to procure 60,000 more masks. But around the same time that day, the President tweeted he and his team “haven’t had to use it.” Trump has suggested there was no need for mandatory marching orders because companies, like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, were already ramping up production of PPE on their own. Trump also said on March 22 that invoking the act would be tantamount to socialism. “The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept,” he told reporters. The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that if the coronavirus outbreak lasts a year, healthcare providers and patients will require 3.5 billion N-95 masks, which are also called respirators. The U.S. currently has roughly 12 million respirators in its national stockpile. Blake expresses disappointment in the government in part for failing to adequately prepare for the crisis. “It is part of the federal government’s responsibility to ensure that there are resources out there for protection of their citizens,” she says. “I find it hard to believe that no one foresaw that this could have been a potential need in this day and time.” In the absence of a coherent national supply chain, states and health care facilities across the country are scrambling to ration what PPE they have. Administrators at hospitals in Seattle and Washington, DC have asked doctors and patients to reuse masks for prolonged periods, while staff at one Chicago hospital have started using washable lab goggles instead of disposable face shields, according to the Washington Post. An article in the American Journal of Infection Control recommends N-95 respirators be put on only five times before they lose their full effectiveness. “Basically, I’ve been told to wear that same N-95 respirator mask for 24 hours,” an emergency physician working in a Tennessee hospital told TIME. “And if it doesn’t get contaminated, I was supposed to reuse it the next day.” At Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, some providers have also begun “reusing masks after shifts,” Lin said. Some have even gone as far as “spraying Lysol on the mask to reuse” it, she adds. The Tennessee hospital has also moved some of its protective garb, like gowns and face shields, to more secure areas. While the measure is reducing theft, it’s also making it harder for healthcare workers to access the supplies when they need them. Recently, when the trauma physician was treating a critically ill trauma patient with a high risk of blood contamination, she didn’t have time to grab the tools necessary to keep her and her patient safe. “We did not have masks with face shields immediately available,” she says. “That was scary.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested on March 17 that health care providers “might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Administrators at both Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and the Providence St. Joseph hospital chain based in Washington state predicted in mid-March that at least some of their facilities were down to a few days worth of critical PPE supplies. In Los Angeles County, where there are at least 536 confirmed patients and seven deaths, a nurse who treats a vulnerable population at a large hospital told TIME she’s been instructed to limit how much PPE she uses, and in some cases, acquire her own. “We have been encouraged to go to Home Depot and buy our own eyewear,” she says. She’s also been asked to give blood, as her hospital grapples with a short supply due to fewer blood drive donations in the surrounding areas. “The Red Cross doesn’t have a normal flow of blood donors coming in,” she says. “Our job is blood, sweat and tears.” In Pittsburg, a labor and delivery nurse tells TIME she is only permitted to wear surgical masks during cesarean sections, despite frequent visits from other staff and unscreened patients who come from at-risk floors. Providers in her department are not given access to the N-95 masks, which provide the best protection against airborne illnesses. “I’m mentally and physically exhausted,” the nurse says. “I’m here to help the community but at the same time, I’m probably exposing them.” According to staff guidance published by the Mt. Sinai Hospital System last week, asymptomatic employees, “regardless of exposure to a known case of COVID-19” would not be tested for the disease. It would also not test employees with mild symptoms “who do not require hospitalization.” In a statement to TIME, Dr. David L. Reich, the system’s president and chief operating officer defended the protocol, saying that Mt. Sinai is following state and city guidelines. “As priorities shift in the coming weeks, Mount Sinai has the capacity to perform additional testing and we will do so, as directed from our city and state officials,” he said. The Tennessee doctor, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution by her employer, explained she’s nearing a breaking point. “It’s pretty overwhelming. This is the most anxious I’ve ever felt in my entire life,” she said through tears, adding, “This is the most stressed out I’ve ever been.” In Italy, where COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker, doctors are facing so many serious cases that many are forced to decide which patients are given ventilators, a life-saving breathing machine. There are nowhere near enough ventilators available in either Italy or the U.S. “What I’d like to tell my American colleagues,” Roberto Tonelli, a 31-year-old pulmonologist in Modena, Italy told TIME, “is be prepared for the amount of deaths you will see.” Back in Florida, Blake is watching Italy closely. “Right now, those of us in healthcare, we all have pre-traumatic stress disorder because we know what’s coming, and we know it’s going to be a storm,” she tells me. She knows that being in her sixties puts her at an increased risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms, she says, but she has no plans to step off the frontlines. “That’s my job. I went into nursing because I wanted to help people,” she says. “I just feel like I’ve got to get in there and use my personal protective equipment.” For her sake, and for that of her patients, hopefully she has enough of it. -With reporting by Francesca Trianni/Orlando and Haley Sweetland Edwards/New York","MARCH 24, 2020"
A New Generation of Activist Doctors Is Fighting for Medicare for All ...,14206,"M
iriam Callahan remembers the patient who clarified her decision to become a political activist. He was homeless, suffered from severe arthritis in his hip and was self-medicating with fistfuls of Advil. That gave him a bleeding gastric ulcer that landed him in the emergency room at a public hospital. Callahan, who is a medical student at Columbia University, and her colleagues patched him up and sent him back to the shelter, where he began self–medicating once again. He was stuck in a horrific cycle. Arthritis isn’t a disease that should kill people, Callahan says, but in this case, it was becoming a real possibility. “It’s immoral,” she says, “the way that we treat people in this country.” In the months since seeing that patient, Callahan has channeled her frustration into political organizing—and she’s hardly alone among her fellow medical professionals. With roughly 27.5 million Americans uninsured and nearly 80 million struggling with medical bills, doctors, nurses, medical students and other patient-facing professionals are finding themselves on the front lines of a broken system. Like Callahan, many are looking for ways to fix it. The result is that the medical field, which was once one of the most conservative professions, is becoming an unlikely hotbed of progressive political activity. One of these advocates’ top goals? Single-payer health care, now known most often by its politically charged nickname: Medicare for All. “I don’t think I can just be a patient advocate at the bedside,” says Deb Quinto, a 38-year-old nurse in California who has canvassed in support of Medicare for All. “It’s our job to protect our community and to protect any threat to their health.” Single-payer health care was once considered a fringe idea in the U.S. But so were the ideas that led to Medicare and Medicaid, through which the government pays for qualifying citizens’ medically necessary services. And over the course of the past few years, proposals for a universal single-payer plan have entered the mainstream political lexicon, at least that of one major party. Large majorities of Democratic voters now say they support some version of Medicare for All, and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, two of the three top-polling Democratic presidential candidates, have made the policy central to their campaigns. There are two Medicare for All bills currently pending before Congress. Medical professionals are central to this growth in popularity. From 2008 to 2017, the share of physicians who favor single-payer health care increased from 42% to 56%, according to Merritt-Hawkins, a physician-recruitment firm. While Medicare for All remains deeply controversial among many Americans—and a nonstarter among most Republicans—physician-activists insist the tide is beginning to turn. “There’s been a sea change in the way we talk about health care reform,” says Dr. Adam Gaffney, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and president of Physicians for a National Health Program, which supports single-payer health care. He notes that as a growing number of doctors advocate for Medicare for All, the policy stands a better chance than it has in a generation. “Whatever reform we achieve,” he says, “we need them—us—to be a part of it and make it work.” For most of the 20th century, physicians were a staunchly Republican group. Overwhelmingly white and male well into the 1990s, many ran their own practices and operated as small-business owners. Their leading trade group, the American Medical Association, reflected their members’ politics: it helped sink attempts by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman to pass universal health care, hiring a public relations firm and employing doctors themselves to warn patients against national insurance. As Medicare gained steam in the 1960s, the group produced a record featuring Ronald Reagan, then an actor, to raise the specter of creeping socialism as part of its pitched, if losing, battle against the safety net for older Americans. But in the past generation, both health care and the job of being a doctor have fundamentally changed. As the insurance industry expanded, physicians have moved from running their own private practices to being employees of hospitals and health systems. Instead of building their own patient bases, doctors nowadays often receive fixed salaries. “What that allowed physicians to do is basically look at the system in a more altruistic way,” says Travis Singleton, executive vice president of Merritt-Hawkins. “It doesn’t mean the independent physician 15 years ago didn’t care about every patient who walked in the door. They simply knew that if they didn’t control their payer mix, then they couldn’t keep the doors open.” Meanwhile, other macroeconomic shifts have affected where doctors live, how they work and who chooses to join the profession in the first place. Beginning in earnest in the 1990s, hospitals and medical groups began consolidating, pushing once rural and suburban doctors into big cities. And as medical schools became more expensive, aspiring doctors began taking on ever larger debt loads. In 2018, medical-school graduates carried a median $200,000 in student debt, a burden heavy enough to reshape expectations. “If you want to make a lot of money, maybe go into finance or business consulting,” says Courtney Harris, a Chicago medical student, who will have $300,000 in student loans when she graduates. As the economics of medicine have shifted, so have the underlying demographics of the profession. In the past two decades, more women and people of color have entered the profession. Medical schools, meanwhile, have expanded their curricula to include information about gun violence, climate change and how social determinants, like class and race, affect people’s health. “These are not just our patients, but our parents, our cousins, our uncles, our grandparents,” says Yoseph Aldras, a medical student whose parents are Honduran and Palestinian. Medical schools have embraced these ideas so thoroughly that when a former associate dean at University of Pennsylvania’s medical school complained about politicized medical education in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he was met with swift backlash from the school’s faculty, students and more than 150 alumni. Other schools have gone further, such as at Oregon Health and Science University, where students themselves now teach a required course on structural factors in health like institutional racism or immigration. Singleton, whose firm conducts a biennial survey of doctors’ opinions, says that while there are myriad reasons for an uptick in political involvement, one of the most compelling is simple: doctors see the dysfunction of the health care system on a daily basis. As health care costs ballooned and the private insurance industry expanded, the job of being a doctor changed. Instead of just treating patients, doctors today must battle with insurance requirements, manage arcane reimbursement systems and juggle enormous administrative costs, Singleton’s firm found. Much of this is a direct consequence of physicians’ early opposition to health care reform, explains Beatrix Hoffman, a history professor at Northern Illinois University. By pushing back against government involvement, she says physicians created the system that is now dominated by private insurance. “We’ve heard so many horror stories from doctors who have come before us about spending hours on the phone negotiating with insurance companies,” says Scott Swartz, a 28-year-old medical student in San Francisco. “That’s not how we want to spend our time.” All of these factors have combined to shift doctors’ politics to the left. In 1994, 67% of political campaign contributions by doctors went to Republicans, according to research by Adam Bonica, Howard Rosenthal and David Rothman. By 2004, donations to Republicans dropped below 50%. And by 2018, the ratio had more than flipped: Democrats captured more than 80% of physician donations last year. “There is an absolutely notable shift over 25 years away from Republicans,” says Rothman, a professor of social medicine at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “And it’s persisting.” A decade ago, many physicians’ groups supported the Obama Administration’s effort to pass the Affordable Care Act, which aimed to extend access to health insurance to nearly all Americans. While the law failed to keep insurance costs low for many Americans, Republicans also failed to present a workable alternative to American voters. Though Republican lawmakers maintained control of the House and Senate in 2017, their attempts to repeal or replace the flawed Obamacare failed, leaving millions of Americans to continue to struggle with sky-high health care costs. This fruitless political maneuvering galvanized many in the physician-activist community. It was clear that Obamacare, which was designed to safeguard access to quality insurance, wasn’t doing enough, they argued. Why not push for a system that skips insurance entirely and instead offers access directly to quality care? “There’s a growing recognition among physicians that the current system, even with the ACA, costs too much, leaves too many people behind,” says Bob Doherty, senior vice president of governmental affairs and public policy at the American College of Physicians (ACP). Enter: renewed interest in single-payer plans. In 2016, the American Academy of Family Physicians, which has supported the idea of “health care for all” since 1989, launched a study of various payment models, hoping to inform discussions of how to reform the health care system. The American College of Physicians, which supports a government-funded option for health insurance, is developing its own recommendations too. The AMA, which has maintained its opposition to Medicare for All, began softening its rhetoric. “The AMA has and always will welcome debate at our House of Delegates on moving forward on health care reform,” says AMA president Dr. Patrice Harris. This attitude reflects a broader cultural consensus, according to Hoffman, the NIU historian. “It’s become more unacceptable than in the past to so blatantly oppose the expansion of health coverage,” she says. Bonica, who led the research on physician partisanship, says that incremental shift makes a difference. “There’s potential for physicians to organize among themselves,” he says. “Conditions are very ripe for that.” At the AMA’s annual meeting in June, members voted on a proposal to remove the organization’s opposition to single-payer health care. It lost, but narrowly—just 47% to 53%. Outside the meeting, a group including doctors, nurses and medical students held a rally and shared stories about why they wanted to fight for universal health care. Two months later, advocates for a government-backed health care option scored another victory when the AMA pulled out of Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, the industry coalition aimed at stopping single-payer and public-option plans. Meanwhile, more doctors are joining activist organizations. Physicians for a National Health Program, an advocacy group of doctors that has been pushing for single-payer since the 1980s, now has 23,000 members across the country and has added 14 new chapters since 2017. PNHP’s student arm, Students for a National Health Program (SNaHP), has grown rapidly as well, says Dr. Richard Bruno, who helped found SNaHP in 2011. It has nearly doubled its membership in the past three years and now has 85 chapters at campuses across the country. Peter Lorenz, a second-year student at Rosalind Franklin University’s Chicago Medical School who helped start a SNaHP chapter this fall, says the base is energized. The old guard “know things are changing,” he says. He’s now working with his school’s student chapter of the AMA, which wants to get Illinois’s state physician group to drop its opposition to single-payer health care. It’s not just aspiring physicians joining the fight. At Columbia, the SNaHP chapter includes students studying dentistry, physical therapy and nursing. Nurses are also out in force, says Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United, whose members have long advocated for single-payer health care. Beginning in February, NNU knocked on 20,000 doors and held nearly 2,000 events talking to voters about Medicare for All. During the congressional recess in August, 1,200 activists organized in 49 House districts. “We’re thrilled that we have this surge of youth and of activism,” she says. But the path forward is uphill. Part of the struggle, PNHP’s Gaffney says, is educating people about what health care reform actually means. Aside from repealing the ACA, Republicans have not offered a coherent plan for the future of health care, but most of the Democratic presidential candidates are vague on details of how their health care proposals would work too. Whether the public supports Medicare for All depends on how pollsters describe the policy. Some universal health care proposals would eliminate all private insurance while others would offer voters the option of choosing to access government health care. In the meantime, medical students, doctors and nurses are still debating what exactly the nuts and bolts of an ideal policy would be. Callahan, the medical student at Columbia, sees education as central to the fight. This semester, she is creating a workshop to help her fellow medical students translate their frustrations into political action. To her, advocating for Medicare for All is, at its heart, a moral fight. Doctors and nurses are consistently ranked among the most trusted professions in the U.S.—and that, she says, comes with an obligation to reform a system that too often leaves families in bankruptcy or forces patients to forgo care that they need but can’t afford. “The idea that things have to be done a certain way because that’s the way they’ve always been done—in the Trump era, that doesn’t hold a lot of water,” says Callahan. “If we gain enough power we can actually make that change and bring about the world we want.”","OCTOBER 24, 2019"
Arkansas Transgender Health Care Ban Temporarily Halted | Time,5081,"A
federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked an Arkansas law that would have banned transgender youth from receiving gender-affirming health care while a lawsuit challenging the law’s constitutionality proceeds. The law would have gone into effect on July 28. In April, Arkansas became the first state in the U.S. to approve a ban that would prevent doctors from providing gender-affirming care—including hormone treatment and puberty blockers—to patients under 18. The law would also prevent doctors from referring patients to other physicians who provide gender-affirming treatment. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit in May on behalf of four transgender children, their families and two doctors challenging the ban, arguing it violates the Constitution and threatens the well-being of trans youth. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Kay Moody in Little Rock, Ark., placed a preliminary injunction on the law’s enforcement while the case moves through the legal system. “To pull this care midstream from these patients, or minors, would cause irreparable harm,” Moody said upon his ruling, according to the Associated Press. Read more: In Arkansas, Trans Youth Face the Country’s Strictest Laws Yet “This ruling sends a clear message to states across the country that gender-affirming care is life-saving care, and we won’t let politicians in Arkansas—or anywhere else—take it away,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, in a statement. “Today’s victory is a testament to the trans youth of Arkansas and their allies…who will continue to defend the right of all trans people to be their authentic selves, free from discrimination. We won’t rest until this cruel and unconstitutional law is struck down for good.” “This is who I am, and it’s frustrating to know that a place I’ve lived all my life is treating me like they don’t want me here,” said 15-year-old Dylan Brandt, one the plaintiffs, in a statement when the suit was filed in May. Should the law go into effect, Brandt will lose access to the gender-affirming treatment he’s received for nearly a year. “Having access to care means I’m able to be myself, and be healthier and more confident—physically and mentally,” Brandt said. “The thought of having that wrenched away and going back to how I was before is devastating.” Republican sponsors of the law, titled “Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act,” argue that the law is meant to protect minors who they say are too young to make decisions related to gender-affirming care. Trans rights advocates have condemned the argument as dangerous, noting that all medical decisions related to minors are made in consultation with their parents and their medical provider, and arguing that the law prevents doctors from providing potentially lifesaving treatment. Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson had vetoed the bill on April 5, calling it “a vast government overreach.” But his veto was overrode by the Republican-majority state legislature the next day, in a 71-24 vote in the House and a 25-8 vote in the Senate. Read more: In Win For LGBTQ Rights, Supreme Court Declines to Hear Appeal Challenging Landmark Trans Rights Ruling “These young people will be unable to obtain medical care that their doctors and parents agree they need—and those already receiving care will have their treatment abruptly halted—which could have serious and potentially life threatening consequences,” the ACLU’s filing said, arguing that the bill violates both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the First Amendment by prohibiting healthcare providers from providing referrals. “For some transgender youth, the prospect of losing this critical medical care, even before the legislation is in effect, is unbearable,” the filing continued. “In the weeks after the bill passed, at least six transgender adolescents in Arkansas attempted suicide.” Read more: HRC Files Lawsuit Challenging Florida’s Transgender Sports Ban—and Announces More To Come The Arkansas law is just one of numerous bills targeting transgender rights that have been proposed in state legislatures in the past seven months. At least 250 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation have been introduced in state legislatures in 2021 alone, according to the LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, and at least 35 of those aim to limit the ability of transgender youth to receive gender-affirming medical care. Some of those bills have also been the subject of litigation; earlier in July a federal judge in Tennessee also blocked a law that required businesses and other entities from notifying customers if they allow transgender people to use public restrooms that match their gender identity, in response to a suit filed by the ACLU. If you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. In emergencies, call 911, or seek care from a local hospital or mental health provider.","JULY 21, 2021"
The World Changed Its Approach to Health After the 1918 Flu | Time,7553,"A
s the world grapples with a global health emergency that is COVID-19, many are drawing parallels with a pandemic of another infectious disease – influenza – that took the world by storm just over 100 years ago. We should hope against hope that this one isn’t as bad, but the 1918 flu had momentous long-term consequences – not least for the way countries deliver healthcare. Could COVID-19 do the same? The 1918 flu pandemic claimed at least 50 million lives, or 2.5 per cent of the global population, according to current estimates. It washed over the world in three waves. A relatively mild wave in the early months of 1918 was followed by a far more lethal second wave that erupted in late August. That receded towards the end of the year, only to be reprised in the early months of 1919 by a third and final wave that was intermediate in severity between the other two. The vast majority of the deaths occurred in the 13 weeks between mid-September and mid-December 1918. It was a veritable tidal wave of death – the worst since the Black Death of the 14th-century – and possibly in all of human history. Flu and COVID-19 are different diseases, but they have certain things in common. They are both respiratory diseases, spread on the breath and hands as well as, to some extent, via surfaces. Both are caused by viruses, and both are highly contagious. COVID-19 kills a considerably higher proportion of those it infects, than seasonal flu, but it’s not yet clear how it measures up, in terms of lethality, to pandemic flu – the kind that caused the 1918 disaster. Both are what are known as “crowd diseases”, spreading most easily when people are packed together at high densities – in favelas, for example, or trenches. This is one reason historians agree that the 1918 pandemic hastened the end of the First World War, since both sides lost so many troops to the disease in the final months of the conflict – a silver lining, of sorts. Crowd diseases exacerbate human inequities. Though everyone is susceptible, more or less, those who live in crowded and sub-standard accommodation are more susceptible than most. Malnutrition, overwork and underlying conditions can compromise a person’s immune deficiencies. If, on top of everything else, they don’t have access to good-quality healthcare, they become even more susceptible. Today as in 1918, these disadvantages often coincide, meaning that the poor, the working classes and those living in less developed countries tend to suffer worst in an epidemic. To illustrate that, an estimated 18 million Indians died during the 1918 flu – the highest death toll of any country, in absolute numbers, and the equivalent of the worldwide death toll of the First World War. Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here. In 1918, the explanation for these inequities was different. Eugenics was then a mainstream view, and privileged elites looked down on workers and the poor as inferior categories of human being, who lacked the drive to achieve a better standard of living. If they sickened and died from typhus, cholera and other crowd diseases, the reasons were inherent to them, rather than to be found in their often abysmal living conditions. In the context of an epidemic, public health generally referred to a suite of measures designed to protect those elites from the contaminating influence of the diseased underclasses. When bubonic plague broke out in India in 1896, for example, the British colonial authorities instigated a brutal public health campaign that involved disinfecting, fumigating and sometimes burning indigenous Indian homes to the ground. Initially, at least, they refused to believe that the disease was spread by rat fleas. If they had, they would have realized that a better strategy might have been to inspect imported merchandise rather than people, and to de-rat buildings rather than disinfect them. Healthcare was much more fragmented then, too. In industrialized countries, most doctors either worked for themselves or were funded by charities or religious institutions, and many people had no access to them at all. Virus was a relatively new concept in 1918, and when the flu arrived medics were almost helpless. They had no reliable diagnostic test, no effective vaccine, no antiviral drugs and no antibiotics – which might have treated the bacterial complications of the flu that killed most of its victims, in the form of pneumonia. Public health measures – especially social distancing measures such as quarantine that we’re employing again today – could be effective, but they were often implemented too late, because flu was not a reportable disease in 1918. This meant that doctors weren’t obliged to report cases to the authorities, which in turn meant that those authorities failed to see the pandemic coming. The lesson that health authorities took away from the 1918 catastrophe was that it was no longer reasonable to blame individuals for catching an infectious disease, nor to treat them in isolation. The 1920s saw many governments embracing the concept of socialized medicine – healthcare for all, free at the point of delivery. Russia was the first country to put in place a centralized public healthcare system, which it funded via a state-run insurance scheme, but Germany, France and the UK eventually followed suit. The U.S. took a different route, preferring employer-based insurance schemes – which began to proliferate from the 1930s on – but all of these nations took steps to consolidate healthcare, and to expand access to it, in the post-flu years. Many countries also created or revamped health ministries in the 1920s. This was a direct result of the pandemic, during which public health leaders had been either left out of cabinet meetings entirely, or reduced to pleading for funds and powers from other departments. Countries also recognized the need to coordinate public health at the international level, since clearly, contagious diseases didn’t respect borders. 1919 saw the opening, in Vienna, Austria, of an international bureau for fighting epidemics – a forerunner, along with the health branch of the short-lived League of Nations, of today’s World Health Organization (WHO). A hundred years on from the 1918 flu, the WHO is offering a global response to a global threat. But the WHO is underfunded by its member nations, many of which have ignored its recommendations – including the one not to close borders. COVID-19 has arrived at a time when European nations are debating whether their healthcare systems, now creaking under the strain of larger, aging populations, are still fit for purpose, and when the US is debating just how universal its system really is. Depending on how bad this new pandemic gets, it may force a rethink in both regions. In the U.S., for example, we have already seen heated discussion of the costs and availability of COVID-19 testing, which could help revive the proposals to make healthcare more affordable, that President Obama put forward in his 2010 healthcare reform plan. In Europe, meanwhile, the outbreak could re-ignite a long-running debate over whether people should pay to use national health services (other than indirectly, through taxes or insurance schemes) – for example through a monthly membership fee. Whether current outbreak generates real change remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: we are being reminded that pandemics are a social problem, not an individual one.

A British Perspective on America's Broken Health Care System | Time,4511,"A
s a Brit, there are many things about the U.S. I’m only too willing to get behind. Pizzas the diameter of a trampoline, for instance, and the fact you’re never more than a few sweaty footsteps away from air-conditioning. Equally, there are some things I struggle with. It’s alu-MIN-ium not ALOO-minum. Your right to bear arms is about as wise as the right to arm bears. Those inexplicable gaps in public toilet doors. But my biggest hang-up isn’t even the orange nightmare you’ve somehow let into the White House—it’s the fact you seem totally fine with just letting people… die. What precisely is your aversion to universal healthcare? To me, the idea that medical attention should be free at the point of access and based on clinical need (not on bank balance), is a good thing. Why are you so enamored with the idea of a health insurance policy which may or may not be of any use to you should something terrible happen? Is it an attempt at population control? There are rather a lot of you, I guess. Or is it some kind of kink? Do you like the danger? Perhaps the possibility of instant, irrevocable poverty is all the incentive you need to not break your leg or get cancer. How’s that working out for you? Things aren’t like that in the UK. Sure, we have many of the same problems you do: a population getting fatter faster than you can say “diabetes” and a government that treats running a country like a lawless game of Monopoly. But when it comes to health care, we’ve got, if I may be so un-Britishly bold to say, the right idea. The National Health Service (or NHS, to make it sound less Orwellian) has been a fixture of our lives for 71 years, and it’s close as we’ve got to a national religion. I’m not saying it’s a perfect system by any means, but I’d drag myself out of a coma to say there’s no set-up that’s fairer. Whether you have heartburn or a heart attack, whether your baby has meningitis or you need a liver transplant, whether you’re walking down the road to your family doctor or an air ambulance is scraping you off the side of a mountain to get you to a trauma center, no one will ask for your credit card or insurance details—it’s already been paid for through your taxes. No questions. No exceptions. No deductibles. No weighing up whether it’s more important that your children eat than you investigate your shortness of breath. And if the very worst happens, your family won’t be left with a bill for your death. With that in mind, I find it utterly baffling that universal healthcare is such a political hot potato on your side of the pond. I hear arguments that your government can’t afford it, even though current UK spending on healthcare is $4,000 per head compared with your $10,000. I even hear untrue, outrageous, outlandish statements about “death panels” from political fear mongers, presumably with financial skin in the game, that are utterly alien to anyone with experience in the NHS system. And yet conversely, Gallup reports for the fifth year in a row that the availability and affordability of healthcare is the single biggest concern for Americans, with 55% worrying about it “a great deal.” Even the most conservative estimates of the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy due to health care bills sits in the hundreds of thousands per year. In the UK, you can count the number of health care bankruptcies on the fingers of, at worst, a hand. And the system works—our life expectancy is two years longer than yours, for starters. I won’t pretend the NHS is some kind of medical utopia. I should know—I worked as a doctor there for seven years. It’s been systematically underfunded for years, its precious resources stretched gossamer thin. There are waiting lists, hospitals in need of redecoration, equipment that needs replacing and doctors with bags under their eyes like leather totes. The cost of the parking meters outside the hospital was more than I made per hour. But it’s still far better than the alternative. The NHS is a promise, an assurance that it will do its best by you—not because you are rich or have the right insurance but because it’s the right thing to do. The only criterion for accessing the NHS is that you need it. And if don’t need it, you sleep better, knowing that it’s there. Its sheer existence is all the insurance you ever need. Much like ant-egg soup, don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.

How COVID-19 Is Revolutionizing Health Care Around the World ...,8468,"I
n 2020 alone, there were at least 3 million deaths from COVID-19, though the true figure is probably 2-3 times higher. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on and is likely to last well into 2022 and beyond. For ten weeks in a row, from the first week of February, 2021, new daily cases globally rose, driven in part by virus variants and by many countries ending public health measures too soon. There are still around 600,000 new cases every day. Nations like Brazil, Canada, India, Iran, and Turkey—as well as some U.S. states like Michigan and Minnesota—recently experienced COVID-19 surges that in some places overwhelmed their health systems. India, in particular, has become a cautionary tale on how devastating the pandemic can get. While some rich nations like Israel and Britain have ended their own recent surges in part through rapid vaccine roll-outs, low- and middle-income countries have so few vaccine doses that less than 1% of their populations are vaccinated, according to Gro Brundtland, former director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). Nevertheless, as two global health professors who collaborate with institutions like the WHO and with researchers in countries like India, Kenya, and South Africa, we see COVID-19 revolutionizing worldwide health care in ways that could have lasting benefits. The pandemic has wrought immense suffering while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of new ways to improve global health. The rapid development of safe, highly effective COVID-19 vaccines—from “lab to jab” in under a year—is an astounding scientific achievement. It is also heralding a vaccine revolution. The vaccines that were licensed the quickest all used new approaches—mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) and viral vectors (AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson). Researchers and pharmaceutical companies are now using these approaches to try and develop vaccines for a range of other diseases like HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. And COVID-19 unleashed many other new ways of doing science. It accelerated international collaborations. It sparked unprecedented mobilization of research funds to develop new diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. Multi-country evaluations fast-tracked the process of evaluation of new products. And for the first time ever, COVID-19 prompted scientists as a whole to immediately share their research online with no paywalls as soon as their papers were ready. Nevertheless, the pandemic has also shown where the obstacles remain in the R&D ecosystem. For example, manufacturing of new health technologies still takes place mostly in rich nations, and these technologies eventually trickle down to low-income nations. Such manufacturing needs to become globalized so that low- and middle-income countries become self-sufficient in producing their own health tools. The regulatory approval process worldwide needs to become faster and more streamlined. And, most importantly, we need to put a system in place to prevent rich nations from hoarding vaccines, diagnostics, and medicines in future pandemics. COVID-19 forced the global adoption of telemedicine. For example, a U.S. study found a 50% increase in telehealth visits in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same time period in 2019. The benefits of telemedicine, say the researchers, include “expanding access to care, reducing disease exposure for staff and patients, preserving scarce supplies of personal protective equipment, and reducing patient demand on facilities.” Every single clinician who we have spoken to—physicians, nurse practitioners, and nurses—who have run telemedicine clinics during COVID-19 tell us that they want such clinics to remain a permanent part of health care delivery. They have been able to reach patients in rural communities and they tell us that many of their patients find telemedicine more convenient. Zeynep Tufekci, Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science, argues that telehealth visits are a game-changer. “Such visits are clearly not appropriate for every condition,” she says, but “when warranted, they can make it much easier for people to access medical help without worrying about transportation, child care, or excessive time away from work.” In low- and middle-income countries, telehealth has been used during the pandemic as a low-cost service to reach people in poor or remote areas. In India, right now, home-based care is the only realistic option for millions of people, as hospitals are overwhelmed. We have also seen community health workers empowered with digital tablets delivering health care in resource-poor regions, such as in the remote Peruvian Amazon. In many parts of the world, services that were designed for non-COVID conditions such as HIV and TB prevention and treatment needed to be redirected to diagnosing and treating COVID-19. For example, a survey last year found that at least 40% of national TB programs were using TB hospitals and dispensaries for the COVID-19 response. Services for non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease were also redirected to COVID-19. In order to try and maintain services for such non-COVID conditions, many health systems adopted a variety of other innovations in primary health care delivery that are likely to become permanent. These include self-testing, in which citizens test themselves at home for various diseases including HIV; self-monitoring of diseases including diabetes; and “task sharing,” in which services are provided by teams of different health workers with different sets of skills. Around six weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic began, three organizations—the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and the Economist Intelligence Unit—published the Global Health Security Index, which ranks nations on how well prepared they were to handle a pandemic. Out of 195 nations, the U.S. was ranked first and the U.K. second. These two rich countries ended up bungling their COVID-19 responses and have two of the highest death rates in the world. The complacent and often arrogant global north is at last realizing it has much to learn from less wealthy nations, including on the importance of investing in public health infrastructure, engaging communities in tackling public health crises, and using clear and consistent public health messaging. Conspiracy theories, bogus remedies, and anti-science ideas have abounded during COVID-19, from the bizarre notion that Bill Gates has put a microchip inside COVID-19 vaccines to the many dangerous assertions by former President Donald Trump, such as his argument that injecting disinfectant or bringing “light inside the body” could cure COVID-19. Social media, meanwhile, has given anti-vaxxers and other science denialists a bigger platform for their dangerous views. The good news is that scientists have responded with urgency and creativity to fight against what the WHO calls an “infodemic.” New hubs for this essential effort, like the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, the Taiwan FactCheck Center, and Britain’s Science Media Centre—as well as new university courses and books—have emerged to specifically tackle misinformation. Despite such efforts, vaccine hesitancy is still a huge issue during this pandemic and will require redoubled efforts to fight misinformation. Alongside COVID-19, the year 2020 saw calls for racial justice and for the global health and development community to acknowledge their roots in colonialism and white supremacy and become “decolonized.” We recently teamed up with 18 other academics who teach global health to write an article in which we used the COVID-19 pandemic to re-imagine our teaching of the future. We argued that COVID-19 should push us to reimagine global health education, focusing more on equity and human rights and integrating anti-racism and anti-oppression into our courses. COVID-19 has been the deadliest pandemic in a hundred years. One in three Americans has lost someone to the coronavirus, and India is the next epicenter. The scars will be enduring. But the pandemic has also catalyzed innovations in science and health care delivery, pushed rich nations to learn from poorer ones, forced us to turn back a tide of misinformation, pushed health higher up global and national agendas and made us better teachers. Out of crisis comes opportunity.","JUNE 3, 2021"
12 Innovations That Will Change Health Care in the 2020s | Time,13049,"P
ocket-size ultrasound devices that cost 50 times less than the machines in hospitals (and connect to your phone). Virtual reality that speeds healing in rehab. Artificial intelligence that’s better than medical experts at spotting lung tumors. These are just some of the innovations now transforming medicine at a remarkable pace. No one can predict the future, but it can at least be glimpsed in the dozen inventions and concepts below. Like the people behind them, they stand at the vanguard of health care. Neither exhaustive nor exclusive, the list is, rather, representative of the recasting of public health and medical science likely to come in the 2020s. Since March, UPS has been conducting a trial program called Flight Forward, using autonomous drone deliveries of critical medical samples including blood or tissue between two branches of a hospital in Raleigh, N.C., located 150 yards apart. A fleet-footed runner could cover the distance almost as fast as the drones, but as a proof-of-concept program, it succeeded, and in October the FAA granted the company approval to expand to 20 hospitals around the U.S. over the next two years. “We expect UPS Flight Forward to one day be a very significant part of our company,” says UPS CEO David Abney of the service, which will deliver urine, blood and tissue samples, and medical essentials like drugs and transfusable blood. UPS is not alone in pioneering air deliveries. Wing, a division of Google’s parent company Alphabet, received similar, but more limited, FAA approval to make deliveries for both Walgreens and FedEx. And in Ghana and Rwanda, drones operated by Silicon Valley startup Zipline are already delivering medical supplies to rural villages. —Jeffrey Kluger There are 7.5 billion humans, and tens of millions of us track our health with wearables like smart watches, as well as with more traditional devices like blood-pressure monitors. If there were a way to aggregate all that data from even a few million of us and make it all anonymous but searchable, medical researchers would have a powerful tool for drug development, lifestyle studies and more. California-based Big Data firm Evidation has developed just such a tool, with information from 3 million volunteers providing trillions of data points. Evidation partners with drug manufacturers like Sanofi and Eli Lilly to parse that data; that work has led to dozens of peer-reviewed studies already, on subjects ranging from sleep and diet to cognitive-health patterns. For founder Christine Lemke, one of Evidation’s ongoing projects, to see if new technologies can effectively measure chronic pain, is personal: Lemke has a rare genetic disease that causes frequent back pain. Evidation is partnering with Brigham and Women’s Hospital on the project.—Jeffrey Kluger Type 1 diabetes affects 1.25 million Americans, but two in particular got Harvard biologist Doug Melton’s attention: his daughter Emma and son Sam. Treatment can involve a lifetime of careful eating, insulin injections and multiple daily blood-glucose tests. Melton has a different approach: using stem cells to create replacement beta cells that produce insulin. He started the work over 10 years ago, when stem-cell research was raising hopes and controversy. In 2014 he co-founded Semma Therapeutics—the name is derived from Sam and Emma—to develop the technology, and this summer it was acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals for $950 million. The company has created a small, implantable device that holds millions of replacement beta cells, letting glucose and insulin through but keeping immune cells out. “If it works in people as well as it does in animals, it’s possible that people will not be diabetic,” Melton says. “They will eat and drink and play like those of us who are not.”—Don Steinberg A major limitation threatens to hamper the era of personalized medicine: people of Caucasian descent are a minority in the global population yet make up nearly 80% of the subjects in human-genome research, creating blind spots in drug research. Dr. Abasi Ene-Obong, 34, founded 54gene to change that. Named for Africa’s 54 countries, the Nigeria-based startup is sourcing genetic material from volunteers across the continent, to make drug research and development more equitable. 54gene is conscious of the ugly history of colonial exploitation in Africa. If companies are going to profit by developing marketable drugs based on the DNA of African people, Africa should benefit: so, when partnering with companies, 54gene prioritizes those that commit to including African countries in marketing plans for any resulting drugs. “If we are part of the pathway for drug creation, then maybe we can also become part of the pathway to get these drugs into Africa,” Ene-Obong says.—Corinne Purtill One of the original disrupters of the new economy is bringing his approach to medical research. The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, established by Napster co-founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker, is a network of top institutions including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stanford, the MD Anderson Cancer Center and more. Its goal is to identify and remove obstacles to innovation in traditional research. For example, all of the participating institutes have agreed to accept an approval decision by any of their respective Institutional Review Boards, which “allows us to get major clinical trials off the ground in weeks rather than years,” says Parker, and at lower costs. Perhaps most important, Parker wants to infuse the project with his market sensibility: “We follow the discoveries coming from our researchers and then put our money behind commercializing them,” he says, either by licensing a product or spinning it out into a company. Since its founding in 2016, the institute has brought 11 projects to clinical trials and supported some 2,000 research papers. A man wearing what looks like a chunky black wristwatch stares at a tiny digital dinosaur leaping over obstacles on a computer screen before him. The man’s hands are motionless, but he’s controlling the dinosaur—with his brain. The device on his wrist is the CTRL-kit, which detects the electrical impulses that travel from the motor neurons down the arm muscles and to the hand almost as soon as a person thinks about a particular movement. “I want machines to do what we want them to do, and I want us to not be enslaved by the machines,” says Thomas Reardon, CEO and co-founder of CTRL-Labs, the device maker. The hunched-over posture and fumbling keystrokes of the smartphone era represent “a step backward for humanity,” says Reardon, a neuroscientist who, in a past life, led the development of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The technology could open up new forms of rehabilitation and access for patients recovering from a stroke or amputation, as well as those with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions, Reardon says.—Corinne Purtill There are more than 4 billion people globally who don’t have access to medical imaging—and could benefit from Butterfly iQ, a handheld ultrasound device. Jonathan Rothberg, a Yale genetics researcher and serial entrepreneur, figured out how to put ultrasound technology on a chip, so instead of a $100,000 machine in a hospital, it’s a $2,000 go-anywhere gadget that connects to an iPhone app. It went on sale last year to medical professionals. “Our goal is to sell to 150 countries that can pay for it. And [the Gates Foundation] is distributing it in 53 countries that can’t,” Rothberg says. The device isn’t as good as the big machines are and won’t replace them in prosperous parts of the world. But it could make scanning more routine. “There was a time when the thermometer was only used in a medical setting, when a blood-pressure cuff was only used in a medical center,” Rothberg says. “Democratizing [health] happens on multiple dimensions.”—Don Steinberg Symptoms of lung cancer usually don’t appear until its later stages, when it’s difficult to treat. Early screening of high-risk populations with CT scans can reduce the risk of dying, but it comes with risks of its own. The U.S. National Institutes of Health found that 2.5% of patients who received CT scans later endured needlessly invasive treatments—-sometimes with fatal results—after radiologists erroneously diagnosed false positives. Shravya Shetty believes artificial intelligence may be the solution. Shetty is the research lead of a Google Health team that in the past two years built an AI system that outperforms human radiologists in diagnosing lung cancer. After being trained on more than 45,000 patient CT scans, Google’s algorithm detected 5% more cancer cases and had 11% fewer false positives than a control group of six human radiologists. The early results are promising, but “there’s a pretty big gap between where things are and where they could be,” says Shetty. “It’s that potential impact that keeps me going.”—Corinne Purtill Every year, more than 2 million peer-reviewed research papers are published—far too many for any individual scientist to digest. Machines, however, don’t share this human limitation. BenevolentAI has created algorithms that scour research papers, clinical trial results and other sources of biomedical information in search of previously overlooked relationships between genes, drugs and disease. BenevolentAI CEO Joanna Shields was an executive at companies such as Google and Facebook, and then the U.K.’s Minister for Internet Safety and Security, before joining BenevolentAI. A frequent critic of the tech industry’s lapses in protecting young people from exploitation and abuse online, Shields sees BenevolentAI as an opportunity to harness technology’s power for good. “All of us have family members, friends who are diagnosed with diseases that have no treatment,” she says. “Unless we apply the scaling and the principles of the technology revolution to drug discovery and development, we’re not going to see a change in that outcome anytime soon.” —Corinne Purtill Whenever the world’s biggest retailer aims its gigantic footprint at a new market, the ground shakes. In September, Walmart opened its first Health Center, a medical mall where customers can get primary care, vision tests, dental exams and root canals; lab work, X-rays and EKGs; counseling; even fitness and diet classes. The prices are affordable without insurance ($30 for an annual physical; $45 for a counseling session), and the potential is huge. In any given week, the equivalent of half of America passes through a Walmart. “When I first started here … [I] thought, That can’t be true,” says Sean Slovenski, a former Humana exec who joined Walmart last year to lead its health care push. If the concept spreads, repercussions await in every direction. Like Walmart’s merchandise suppliers, doctors and other medical pros may need to adjust to the retailer’s everyday low prices. Still, cautions Moody’s analyst Charles O’Shea: “Health care is multiple times harder than selling food.”—Don Steinberg For too many people with suspected heart problems, invasive catheterization is necessary to diagnose blocked or narrowed arteries. Doctors must then choose the best method for improving blood flow from a handful of options, including balloon angioplasty and stenting. Charles Taylor, a former Stanford professor, started HeartFlow to help patients avoid invasive diagnostic procedures and improve treatment outcomes. The company’s system creates personalized 3-D models that can be rotated and zoomed into, so doctors can simulate various approaches on screens. In some cases, it can help avoid invasive procedures entirely. “By adding the HeartFlow … to our available resources for diagnosing stable coronary disease, we are able to provide patients with better care as we evaluate risk,” said Duke University cardiologist Manesh Patel, at the American College of Cardiology’s annual meeting in March. —Jeffrey Kluger Isabel Van de Keere was at work one day in 2010 when a steel light fixture pulled loose from the ceiling and fell on her. The accident left Van de Keere, a Belgian-born Ph.D. in biomedical engineering, with a cervical spine injury and severe vertigo that required three years of intense neurological rehabilitation. She practiced the same tedious exercises dozens of times in a row, with progress so slow it seemed undetectable. Now 38, she’s the founder and CEO of Immersive Rehab, a London-based startup whose goal is to change the neurological-rehab experience using virtual reality. By expanding the range and type of exercises patients can try, VR creates more opportunities to harness the brain’s plasticity and repair neural pathways; increases the amount of data caregivers can use to measure progress and adapt programs; and improves the monotonous, frustrating experience of rehab. Feedback from volunteer patients and therapists has been promising; the company is now preparing to run clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe.—Corinne Purtill","OCTOBER 25, 2019"
Obama Administration Admits Healthcare.gov Was Hacked in July ...,2031,"A
hacker managed to breach cybersecurity at HealthCare.gov and implant malicious code on the federal Obamacare website, officials revealed Thursday. Healthcare.gov hosts the federal insurance exchange on which millions of Americans have purchased health insurance since the Affordable Care Act mandate that most people be insured began rolling out last year. Officials said they learned of the hack, which took place in July, last week. The attack is apparently the first instance of a hacker successfully breaking through the site’s defenses, an anonymous employee of the Department of Health and Human Services told The Wall Street Journal. Officials said the attacker does not appear to have stolen any personal data and only broke in to a server used to test run software for the site. HHS said the Healthcare.gov site doesn’t seem to have been a specific target of the attack. “Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information; data was not transmitted outside the agency, and the website was not specifically targeted,” HHS said in a statement to the WSJ. “We have taken measures to further strengthen security.” Investigators found that hackers had not coordinated an assault to get valuable personal information, but had intended to install malware to allow other computers to control the Healthcare.gov system for later mass attacks, like a DDOS attack, designed to send so many visitors to a website it overwhelms the site’s ability to function. Investigators said they believe the hack is not the work of another government or government sponsored group. Such security breaches are not uncommon but the attack raises concerns about the security of the website, which contains confidential personal details of millions of Americans. Republicans, who are united in opposition to the law and its implementation, have long warned the site was at risk of attack by hackers. “If this happened anywhere other than HealthCare.gov, it wouldn’t be news,” a senior DHS official told the WSJ.

Idaho Hospitals Rationing Health Care Amid COVID-19 Surge | Time,7454,"BOISE, Idaho — Idaho public health leaders announced Tuesday that they activated “crisis standards of care” allowing health care rationing for the state’s northern hospitals because there are more coronavirus patients than the institutions can handle. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare quietly enacted the move Monday and publicly announced it in a statement Tuesday morning — warning residents that they may not get the care they would normally expect if they need to be hospitalized. The move came as the state’s confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocketed in recent weeks. Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. The state health agency cited “a severe shortage of staffing and available beds in the northern area of the state caused by a massive increase in patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization.” The designation includes 10 hospitals and healthcare systems in the Idaho panhandle and in north-central Idaho. The agency said its goal is to extend care to as many patients as possible and to save as many lives as possible. The move allows hospitals to allot scarce resources like intensive care unit rooms to patients most likely to survive and make other dramatic changes to the way they treat patients. Other patients will still receive care, but they may be placed in hospital classrooms or conference rooms rather than traditional hospital rooms or go without some life-saving medical equipment. At Kootenai Health — the largest hospital in northern Idaho — some patients are waiting for long periods for beds to open up in the full intensive care unit, said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff. Inside the ICU, one critical care nurse might be supervising up to six patients with the help of two other non-critical care nurses. That’s a big departure from the usual one ICU nurse for one ICU patient ratio, he said. On Monday, the Coeur d’Alene hospital started moving some coronavirus patients into its nearby conference center. A large classroom in the center was converted into a COVID-19 ward, with temporary dividers separating the beds. Some emergency room patients are being treated in a converted portion of the emergency room lobby, and the hospital’s entire third floor has also been designated for coronavirus patients. Urgent and elective surgeries are on hold, Scoggins said, and Kootenai Health is struggling to accept any of the high-level trauma patients that would normally be transferred from the smaller hospitals in the region. Other states are preparing to take similar measures if needed. Hawaii Gov. David Ige quietly signed an order last week releasing hospitals and health care workers from liability if they have to ration health care. The unfolding crush of patients to Idaho hospitals has been anticipated with dread by the state’s heath care providers. Medical experts have said that Idaho could have as many as 30,000 new coronavirus cases a week by mid-September if the current rate of infections lasts. “Crisis standards of care is a last resort. It means we have exhausted our resources to the point that our healthcare systems are unable to provide the treatment and care we expect,” Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in a statement. He added: “This is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid. The best tools we have to turn this around is for more people to get vaccinated and to wear masks indoors and in outdoor crowded public places. Please choose to get vaccinated as soon as possible – it is your very best protection against being hospitalized from COVID-19.” The designation will remain in effect until there are enough resources — including staffing, hospital beds and equipment or a drop in the number of patients — to provide normal levels of treatment to all. More than 500 people were hospitalized statewide with COVID-19 on Sept. 1 and more than a third of them were in intensive care unit beds. Idaho’s hospitals have struggled to fill empty nursing, housekeeping and other health care positions, in part because some staffers have left because they are burned out by the strain of the pandemic and because others have been quarantined because they were exposed to COVID-19. Late last month, Little called in 220 medical workers available through federal programs and mobilized 150 Idaho National Guard soldiers to help hospitals cope with the surge. Two hundred of the federal workers are medical and administrative staffers available through a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. The U.S. Department of Defense agreed to send a 20-person medical response team to northern Idaho. The Idaho National Guard soldiers will help with logistical support such as screenings and lab work. On Tuesday, the governor called the move to limit care “an unprecedented and unwanted point in the history of our state” and urged residents to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that full vaccination with any of the currently available coronavirus vaccines dramatically reduces the risk of requiring hospitalization for a coronavirus infection. “More Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines,” said Little, who is a Republican. When the pandemic first came to Idaho at the start of 2020, Little ordered a partial shutdown of the state — ordering some businesses to temporarily close or shift to take-out style services, banning some large gatherings and asking residents to stay home as much as possible. The move was aimed at ensuring that hospitals wouldn’t become overwhelmed by patients. Idaho was on the verge of enacting crisis standards of care during a major coronavirus surge last winter, but narrowly avoided doing so — making this the first time the state has taken the drastic measure. Little reopened the state in stages over a period of several months and has not reimposed restrictions limiting gatherings. Businesses are mostly operating as normal. The state’s crisis guidelines are complex, and give hospitals a legal and ethical template to use while rationing care. Under the guidelines, patients are given priority scores based on a number of factors that impact their likelihood of surviving a health crisis. Those deemed in most in need of care and most likely to benefit from it are put on priority lists for scarce resources like ICU beds. Others in dire need but with lower chances of surviving will be given “comfort care” to help keep them pain-free whether they succumb to their illnesses or recover. Other patients with serious but not life-threatening medical problems will face delays in receiving care until resources are available. “I hope that your takeaway from this is that the vaccines work. They are the best tool by far that we have,” to keep people from getting seriously sick from the coronavirus, said Jeppesen, the state health department director. The demand on hospitals is likely to increase in coming weeks as case numbers continue to climb, Jeppesen said, so everyone should take steps to avoid needing any emergency care if possible by wearing seatbelts, taking medication as prescribed and reconsidering activities like riding bikes that can lead to accidents. “Just be a little more careful,” he said.","SEPTEMBER 8, 2021"
Medical Workers' Photos Show Toll of Treating COVID-19 Patients ...,1766,"N
urses, doctors and other health care workers around the world are sharing photos of their bruised faces after spending hours at hospitals wearing protective masks and goggles treating patients with COVID-19. As the pandemic has rapidly intensified the daily lives of workers in healthcare facilities around the world, doctors and nurses have urged other people to stay at home to limit the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, the health care workers themselves have been pushed to the frontline of an outbreak that has already claimed nearly 14,000 lives, putting themselves in harm’s way both physically and mentally. On social media, health care workers have been sharing anecdotes about their experience, as well as photos of their tired faces, marked by the protective gear they wear in hopes of not getting infected. In the United Kingdom, anesthetic registrar Natalie Silvey posted an image of her reddened face after a hard day’s work on Twitter Saturday. “This is the face of someone who just spent nine hours in personal protective equipment moving critically ill COVID-19 patients around London. I feel broken – and we are only at the start. I am begging people, please please do social distancing and self isolation,” Silvey wrote. Critical nurse Emma Sterba responded to Silvey with her own selfie, writing, “I feel your pain.” In Italy, images of healthcare workers Nicola Sgarbi, Martina Benedetti, and Alessia Bonari went viral as the three shared photos of their exhausted faces. In the United States, a nurse used her selfie to make a political statement. Others have joined in on sharing and as cases are expected to rise throughout much of the world, many call for their fellow citizens to practice social distancing and self-isolation.","MARCH 22, 2020"
How Our Health-Care System Is Feeding the Obesity Epidemic | Time,6713,"Bruce Y. Lee is an associate professor of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center O
besity in America is a staggering public health crisis, ravaging our population, hampering the quality of life for millions and wreaking fiscal havoc along the way. We can rightly place some blame on obvious culprits we encounter every day: super-sized drinks, processed foods and obscene portion sizes. But my time as the Executive Director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has led me to a more startling and less apparent conclusion: our health-care system is keeping us from turning back obesity in America. Each year in our country, the wide variety of obesity-related diseases (ranging from muscle and joint problems to diabetes to heart disease to cancer) result in an estimated 400,000 deaths and $190 billion in health care costs—nearly 21% of all medical spending. In the past 35 years, the prevalence of obesity jumped from 15% of the population to 35%. An epidemic with such a high impact, in terms of lives and dollars, would seem to demand a clarion call from the White House to Congress to the halls of Health and Human Services and every health-care system, major medical society, employer and insurer. Instead, we’ve seen an approach that is heavy on concern but light on coordinated action. We have no clear plan for battling the obesity epidemic that impacts tens of millions of lives in the U.S. alone. Any discussion during the 2016 political season that centers on health-care reform, the federal budget or the economy would be incomplete without consideration of the obesity epidemic. If we’re going to move the needle of our obesity scale and create a healthier nation, we must take a closer look at reforming the health-care system itself. I blame the health-care system for three reasons: 1. Failed Incentives Medicare and insurance reimbursement do not provide strong enough financial incentive for physicians, clinics and hospitals to focus on obesity prevention and control. The average salary of primary care physicians, who are on the front lines on preventing obesity, is less than half that of specialists such as dermatologists ($220,942 versus $471,555, based on a 2013 compensation report). This disparity has been steadily widening since the early 1990s. Primary care physicians also are overloaded and lack the time for obesity prevention. A 2004 American Journal of Public Health study found that primary physicians would require 7.4 hours a day (on top of everything else they need to do, such as diagnose and treat disease and handle paperwork) just to do all the preventive measures that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends. Since 2004 that list has grown. A 2014 study published in the journal Clinical Obesity found that only half of primary care physician visits included weight discussions, and only about a third of discussions included an assessment and treatment strategy. If the health-care system is serious about obesity, then reimbursement policies need to change dramatically to promote obesity prevention and control. 2. Lack of Medical Education Many healthcare professionals don’t have enough knowledge, training and resources to prevent and control obesity. A survey published in Obesity Research and Clinical Practice late last year showed that primary care physicians, endocrinologists, cardiologists and bariatricians had little familiarity with four major obesity guidelines that are considered the foundation for treating obesity today. Those surveyed generally didn’t understand what treatments help obese patients lose weight and get healthier. Other studies have shown that medical school curricula don’t teach enough about topics that help prevent obesity, such as nutrition, physical activity, psychology, epidemiology, economics, and health and food marketing. Medical and residency education focus heavily on hospital care and disease treatment, rather than disease prevention. And though the health-care system has dedicated efforts toward better understanding certain biological processes behind obesity (which could lead to developing more medications), fewer efforts have sought to unearth how numerous factors around you might affect your diet, physical activity, metabolism and weight. Obesity is a complex health problem that involves one’s biology, food access, education and myriad other factors. We know now that it’s not simply a lack of self-control. Studies have pointed to a number of different trends since 1980 that might be at fault, and the list is long, from processed food to portion sizes, from sitting too much to sleeping less, from higher stress to communities that are not walkable. We need more research to fully understand how these and other factors might fit together to properly guide healthcare professionals. 3. Limited Role of Physicians As long as physicians only address the individual patient on the examination table, the medical profession cannot effectively prevent and treat obesity. How useful is telling patients to improve their diet and increase their physical activity if the stores in their neighborhoods don’t sell fresh fruits and vegetables and they don’t have the time to exercise or the money for a gym membership? Major decisions about infrastructure (where to build highways, how to ensure green spaces) and consumerism (how to regulate foods and beverages) certainly impact health, but physicians and other healthcare professionals often play no role, or simply minor roles, in such decision making. Lawyers typically are involved in all of these types of decisions to provide legal guidance. Physicians, too, should play a consulting role regarding communal health issues. What’s painfully clear through my deep examination of the obesity epidemic is that this national problem is not being met with a commensurate response from the medical and health care community. Obesity costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year and impacts millions of lives. It’s a threat to our individual well-being and to our national well-being. Insurers, medical schools, public health officials, doctors and anyone discussing health care in America must include obesity in that conversation. We know we’ll be on the right track when our health care system prioritizes prevention. We as a country should be alarmed by the state of obesity in America and demand a comprehensive, full-throated, urgent response to this national crisis. And that effort must begin with a head-to-toe examination of the No. 1 culprit: the health-care system itself.","SEPTEMBER 23, 2016"
"Jimmy Kimmel on Health Care, Politics: Complete Timeline | Time",5377,"O
ver the past eight months, Jimmy Kimmel has emerged as a prevalent political voice in the late-night world. It all began when Kimmel opened the May 1 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! by recounting the birth of his son, William “Billy” Kimmel, who was born with a congenital heart defect and underwent open heart surgery at just three days old. Kimmel explained that this experience had opened his eyes to the heartbreak facing families who couldn’t afford to pay for their child’s medical care. Since then, Kimmel has become an ardent advocate for universal health care coverage. He has also used his show as a platform to speak out on other issues, including gun control and the controversies surrounding the Alabama Special Election. Here’s your comprehenensive guide to all the times Jimmy Kimmel has gotten political. Kimmel opened his first show after the April birth of his second child with wife Molly McNearney by tearfully revealing that their newborn son Billy had to have open heart surgery at just three days old due to a congenital heart defect. He then delivered an emotional plea for universal health care coverage that quickly went viral, garnering support from prominent Democratic political figures such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of celebrities. “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,” he said. “I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?” Kimmel’s next major foray into the national health care debate came amidst a September push by Senate Republicans to vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill, a proposal co-sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy that would have repealed major chunks of Obamacare had it passed. The late night host called out Sen. Cassidy for saying he would only support a bill if it ensured no child would be denied medical care because their family couldn’t afford it—a standard Cassidy had dubbed the Jimmy Kimmel Test during a May appearance on Live! “This new bill actually does pass the Jimmy Kimmel Test — but a different Jimmy Kimmel Test,” Kimmel explained. “With this one, your child with a preexisting condition will get the care he needs if and only if his father is Jimmy Kimmel. Otherwise you might be screwed.” After Sen. Cassidy brushed Kimmel’s criticism aside by saying that he was sorry Kimmel didn’t understand the bill, the Live! host fired back with a list of health organizations that were also opposed to the legislation, including the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association and American Cancer Society. “I don’t want to turn this into a Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation, but when Senator Cassidy was on my show in May, he told me that he believed that every American family regardless of income should be able to get quality health care. And I believed he was sincere. Sadly, the bill he unveiled last week with Senator Lindsey Graham indicates that he was not sincere. It is by many accounts the worst health care bill yet.” On the third night of Kimmel’s campaign against Graham-Cassidy, the late night pundit came out swinging at President Donald Trump, who had tweeted that he wouldn’t sign the “great bill” if it didn’t include coverage for pre-existing conditions. “For Donald Trump, this isn’t about the Graham-Cassidy bill. It’s about getting rid of Obamacare, which he hates, primarily because Obama’s name is on it. He likes to have his name on things,” Kimmel said. “He’d sign Qurans at the Barnes and Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare.”   Following the Las Vegas shooting—the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history—Kimmel was brought to tears on the Live! stage discussing the tragedy that had occurred in his hometown. He dedicated that night’s opening monologue to calling for gun control, or as he refered to it, “common sense.” “What I’m talking about tonight isn’t about gun control; it’s about common sense,” Kimmel said. “Common sense says no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 Americans at a concert. Common sense says you don’t let those who suffer from mental illness buy guns.” Leading up to the Alabama Special Election, Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore started a Twitter war with Kimmel by challenging the late night host to confront him “man-to-man” after Tony Barbieri—a comedian who has appeared on Live! under the stage name Jake Byrd—disrupted an event at an Alabama church where Moore was speaking. The feud then escalated when Kimmel not only tweeted a jab at Moore’s “Christian values” but responded to the summons on his show that night. “I happen to be a Christian too. And I will share what I learned at my church: at my church, forcing yourself on underage girls is a no-no,” he said, referencing the allegations of sexual misconduct Moore is facing from multiple women who say they were teenagers at the time. “Some even consider it to be a sin.” Kimmel’s crusade against Moore continued right up to the day of the Special Election, when he took a preemptive victory lap celebrating Moore’s defeat. “I don’t know the results yet, the polls just closed, but I do know Roy Moore shouldn’t even be in the race,” he said. “And I’m not talking about the Senate race, I mean the human race.”  ","DECEMBER 26, 2017"
How Americans Could Have Cheap Health Care Almost Instantly ...,6927,"Battin, a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Adjunct Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Utah, is the author most recently of The Ethics of Suicide: Historical Sources. C
an’t agree on health care, how to finance it or how to cover the uninsured? Think big. And look carefully: it’s right before our eyes. Imagine comprehensive, universal, effective and cheap health care for all Americans, essentially overnight. It would require hiring more doctors, nurses and other health professionals as well as utilizing more hospitals and medical facilities, but it would be remarkably easy compared to all the other health care proposals afloat now. That’s because the medical expertise and the infrastructure to make this possible already exist — right here in our Veterans Affairs health care system. What we need is a new, thoroughgoing, workable solution to our health-care problems. So here is a simple proposal: Over the next decade, beginning right away with those who are currently uninsured, let’s gradually build out the VA, or a redesigned VA-like civilian system, by funding it more instead of less. If proven effective, eventually health care at the VA could be offered as an option to all Americans — regardless of socio-economic status, age, disability or preexisting conditions — paid for by all as a modest increment in taxes, but virtually free to the patient (or free with a reasonable copay). This suggestion isn’t entirely new. A decade ago, public policy expert Phillip Longman published a detailed proposal for how this might work in his book Best Care Anywhere. So why make it again now? Because the current president has the temperament to just do it. It is the best, cheapest, fastest way that President Donald Trump and Congress, in this fractured climate, could make good on Trump’s promise that there’d be something better than Obamacare — “insurance for everybody,” as he told the Washington Post, in which everyone is “beautifully covered.” America’s VA is one of the world’s largest federally run health-care systems. It isn’t broken. Tax-supported, with salaried physicians and rigorous practice guidelines, it is in many ways better than some private health care. There’s a reason the VA’s so effective and yet so inexpensive, compared to private health care: it stresses evidence-based treatment and coordinated care, instead of bouncing patients from one doctor to another in an open-market system. It’s hard to argue that the VA isn’t good enough, especially for those facing a future with no insurance at all. It’s comprehensive, efficient, cost-effective and, except for some modest charges for prescriptions and a few other items and services, almost entirely free to patients and treasured by the veterans who use it. Of course, the VA has its share of problems. Some concerns are systemic and serious; some are single-incident grievances. But in terms of quality of care, it outranks much of U.S. medicine. So rather than scaling back funding and privatizing the VA, as the Trump Administration has proposed, what if we fund it more and open its doors to all who are uninsured? Nothing need change about the private sector: insurance companies can continue to flourish if they offer their customers adequate coverage at a reasonable price. It would be a win-win for all. What makes this proposed national solution different is that the VA isn’t just a single-payer solution. It is both single-payer and single-provider; it pays for the visit to the doctor’s office and is the doctor’s office. Instead of focusing on an elaborate (and confusing) system of tax credits and subsidies and commercial exchanges selling insurance coverage for people who have to buy health care on the open market — that’s the way the Affordable Care Act works — it’s about providing actual health care to people who need it. Free to the consumer, however, doesn’t mean free. Someone will have to pay for this care. But the truth is we, as a society, already are. Patients who are commercially insured, philanthropic organizations, government programs and taxpayers already partly subsidize the health care of those who aren’t insured — an estimated $85 billion in uncompensated care per year. The VA is uniquely poised to tackle health care efficiently. Unlike the traditional fee-for-service structure, which can perversely incentivize providers to do more in order to get paid more, the VA is structured to deliver preventive and appropriate care, to avoid under-treatment and over-treatment, and to catch physical and mental problems that can lead to costly social problems. It can spare doctors the hassle, and save the system the costs, of fee-for-service billing to medical middlemen and insurers. And it would protect people from sometimes crushing medical debt. If by “almost overnight” we understand a phase-in that might take several years, maybe as much as a decade, this becomes a plausible suggestion for health care reform. We just need the President, and Congress, to act. The VA isn’t the same as the active military medical system, but nevertheless it is a federal agency with Cabinet-level status. A sitting president with a similarly motivated Congress could make opening the VA happen faster than almost any other health care reform possible, once they understood the human implications and the math. Health care access for all? It is eminently doable. In fact, all the other nations of the developed world already have universal health care, organized in a variety of different ways but all at far lower cost and most with better outcomes. We’d finally catch up — and perhaps make America great, in this regard, for the first time. In the meantime, let our multiple private and public health care systems co-exist and compete. If people don’t like government systems (including Medicare and Medicaid), let them use private ones. Over time, if those who already have insurance find the VA cheaper and better and get to vote with their feet, the system would adjust to meet demand, balancing government health care with private health care according to the resources and preferences of individuals. No one would have to use government health care; no one would have to go private. This proposal glosses over any number of real-world problems of health care delivery and financing. We’d have to add pediatric services to the VA’s otherwise comprehensive menu of care, for example, and make sure VA facilities are geographically accessible to the uninsured. These challenges and certainly others would arise during the phase-in period. But if this proposed new public system reproduces the successes of the current VA, it will be both cheaper and higher in patient satisfaction. It should work. And if it doesn’t — if the prospect of real competition should cause the private sector to dramatically improve its performance and its pricing — then we’d still be far better off.","SEPTEMBER 12, 2017"
Joe Biden Discusses 'Bidencare' Health Care Plan at Debate | Time,3854,"P
resident Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have starkly different visions for the future of health care in America, and during Thursday night’s debate they clashed over whose ideas would help more people. The catch? Only one of the candidates actually has a health care plan to talk about. Trump began this portion of the debate by repeating his usual criticisms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. “I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful health care,” the President said. His administration is currently backing a challenge to the landmark health care law at the Supreme Court. If the high court overturns the ACA—an outcome that is more likely since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died—more than 20 million people would lose their health insurance coverage. As many as 133 million Americans who have pre-existing conditions could also be denied coverage or charged significantly higher premiums if the law were to be struck down, according to a 2017 analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump tried to address this pressing issue for many voters by saying that “pre-existing conditions will always stay.” But Biden pushed back, correctly noting that Trump has not explained how he would do this. Republicans have been promising a replacement for former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law for a decade and have never come up with a comprehensive health care plan of their own. When Trump ran for president in 2016, he too began saying he would propose a new health care plan. Despite continuing this refrain throughout his time in office and even holding an event touted as the unveiling of a plan last month, Trump has not offered any evidence that he would be able to prevent Americans from losing their health care coverage without the ACA. Biden took the opportunity to plug his own health care plan, which he called “Bidencare” multiple times on stage, a sign that he is growing more confident in the popularity of the proposal. The former Vice President would boost the ACA’s subsidies to help more people buy health coverage and would create a government-run public option. The idea of a public option for health insurance has gotten significantly more popular in recent months. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that 67% of likely voters support a public option, even more than the 55% who support Obamacare. As millions of Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance during the coronavirus pandemic, the idea of having another option may seem more appealing. Biden said he views health care as a right, not a privilege—a line that echoes the ideas that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren frequently advocated during the Democratic primary earlier this year. Biden also took a page from Sanders’ playbook when describing how his proposal would need to more cost money in order to help Americans save more on their premiums. “The Bidencare proposal will in fact provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we’re going to do is going to cost some money,” Biden said during the debate. When Trump tried to accuse Biden of promoting socialized medicine, however, Biden explained that his plan does not eliminate private insurance and drew a clear distinction between himself and the more progressive candidates in his own party. “The reason I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance,” Biden said. And in true Biden fashion, the former Vice President made sure to remind Trump that he is the one currently deciding the health care plan of the Democratic Party. “He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden,” Biden said. “I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.”","OCTOBER 22, 2020"
"The U.S. Spends $2,500 Per Person on Health Care Administrative ...",5872,"W
hether it’s interpreting medical bills, struggling to get hospital records, or fighting with an insurance provider, Americans are accustomed to battling bureaucracy to access their health care. But patients’ time and effort are not the only price of this complexity. Administrative costs now make up about 34% of total health care expenditures in the United States—twice the percentage Canada spends, according to a new study published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine. These costs have increased over the last two decades, mostly due to the growth of private insurers’ overhead. The researchers examined 2017 costs and found that if the U.S. were to cut its administrative spending to match Canadian levels, the country could have saved more than $600 billion in just that one year. “The difference [in administrative costs] between Canada and the U.S. is enough to not only cover all the uninsured but also to eliminate all the copayments and deductibles, and to amp up home care for the elderly and disabled,” says Dr. David Himmelstein, a professor at the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College and co-author of the study. “And frankly to have money left over.” Research has long shown that the U.S., which uses a disparate system of private providers and insurers, has higher administrative costs than other developed countries that use single-payer systems. But the Annals study puts a finer point on it: as the first major effort to calculate administrative costs across the U.S. health system in nearly two decades, the researchers found that the gap between the U.S. and Canada has widened significantly. The U.S. now spends nearly five times more per person on health care administration than Canada does. The U.S. administrative costs came out to $812 billion in 2017, or $2,497 per person in the U.S. compared with $551 per person in Canada, according to the Annals study. Along with Himmelstein, co-authors Steffie Woolhandler and Terry Campbell examined administrative costs for insurance companies and government agencies that administer healthcare, as well as costs in four settings: hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies and hospices and physician practices. For each category, the researchers determined which costs were administrative and conducted analyses to adjust comparisons between relative costs in the U.S. and Canada. Insurers’ overhead, the largest category, totaled $275.4 billion in the U.S. in 2017, or 7.9% of all national health expenditures, compared with $5.36 billion in Canada, or 2.8% of national health expenditures. The American number included $45 billion in government spending to administer health care programs and $229.5 billion in private insurers’ overhead and profits, which covers employer plans and managed care plans funded by Medicare and Medicaid. This insurance overhead accounted for most of the total increase in administrative spending in the U.S. since 1999, according to the study. While the share of Americans covered by commercial insurance plans has not changed much, private insurers have expanded their role as subcontractors handling what are known as “managed care” plans for Medicaid and Medicare. The study notes that most Medicaid recipients are now on private managed care plans and about one third of Medicare enrollees now have Medicare Advantage plans. Both of these types of plans have higher overhead costs than the publicly administered alternatives. “We were struck, and frankly hadn’t expected it until we delved into the data, by the huge increase in insurance overhead,” Himmelstein told TIME. Other reports, including one by the Center for American Progress published last April, have identified ways to reduce administrative costs without moving the U.S. to a single-payer health care system. But Himmelstein says his study shows that a public option that preserves private insurance wouldn’t provide the same savings as a traditional single-payer system. “We could streamline the bureaucracy to some extent with other approaches, but you can’t get nearly the magnitude of savings that we could get with a single payer,” Himmelstein says, adding, “If the Medicare public option includes the Medicare Advantage plans, it’s actually conceivable that the public option would increase the bureaucratic costs.” Most of the public option plans proposed by Democratic presidential candidates are not detailed enough to determine exact costs, Himmelstein says. But overall, he believes they won’t result in significant cost savings. In addition to their research, Himmelstein and Woolhandler have been longtime advocates for single-payer health care. They co-founded the group Physicians for a National Health Program, which advocates for a single-payer system. They also conducted the initial health administrative costs study on 1999 data and have published other studies comparing hospital administrative costs in the U.S. and other countries. Himmelstein says his team’s estimates of total U.S. administrative costs in the Annals study are likely conservative. When estimating physicians’ administrative costs, the researchers relied on a 2011 study of time spent by physicians and their staffs interacting with insurers. And he notes that while 2017 data was often the latest available when they were conducting this study, 2018 health spending numbers have since come out showing further increases in insurance overhead. “We can afford universal coverage with a single payer plan, not just universal coverage but first dollar coverage for everybody in our country if we adopted a single-payer Medicare for all approach,” Himmelstein says. “If you’re going to cover everybody without getting those savings you’re going to have to spend more or you’re going to have to have big co-payments and deductibles that deter people from getting the care that they actually need.”","JANUARY 6, 2020"
President Carter: Lack of Universal Healthcare Should Be a ...,6021,"Gro Harlem Brundtland is a former Prime Minister of Norway and former Director-General of the World Health Organisation. Jimmy Carter is a former President of the United States of America. Both are members of The Elders, a group of independent leaders, founded by Nelson Mandela ten years ago, who work together for peace, justice and human rights. The Elders are campaigning with civil society partners for UHC as part of the #WalkTogether initiative, highlighting courageous moral leadership in communities around the world. Dr Brundtland is Deputy Chair of The Elders. President Carter is an Elder Emeritus. “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” are the inalienable rights at the heart of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. The text is as dear today to the hearts of the American people as it was when Thomas Jefferson first penned his words nearly two and a half centuries ago. But these fundamental rights are denied to millions of Americans because they do not enjoy one of the essential foundations of a fair society: the right to health. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a target defined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and it is achieved when everybody receives the health care they need without suffering financial hardship. Twice in the last five years, all countries of the world have gathered in New York and committed themselves to achieve this noble goal, and it is the explicit health priority of the World Bank and the World Health Organization. The Elders – the group of independent former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, of which we have the honor to be members – has been campaigning for UHC at a global and national level for the past two years. We believe that it is as vital an issue for the US as it is for any other country in the world, and that with bold leadership from national and state leaders, it could and should become a reality. Even after the Affordable Care Act slashed the number of uninsured Americans by about 20 million, another 28 million still lack any health insurance coverage. Many millions more who do have insurance still face unaffordable co-payments whenever they use health services. In 2010, before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, an estimated 26,000 Americans died prematurely due to their lack of health coverage. This represents a violation of basic human rights. Millions of Americans cannot live healthy lives, or protect their children from illness or disease. In a country as rich as the United States, blessed with talented medical professionals, world-class hospitals and research institutes, and an almost unparalleled capacity for technological innovation, the lack of universal health coverage should be a national scandal. It is all the more scandalous given the extremely high cost of the US health care system, which takes up 17.1 percent of Gross National Product. This is 40 percent higher than the average for high-income countries, but the heavy reliance on private financing leads to severe inefficiencies and inequalities within the system. Around a third of health expenditure is spent on administrative costs rather than infrastructure or patient care. None of this is inevitable, and a viable alternative is close at hand. For US neighbors and allies such as Canada and the United Kingdom, UHC has been a cherished element of the social contract between government and citizens for decades. UHC is also now an explicit Sustainable Development Goal of all countries, and some developing countries such as Thailand and Sri Lanka are already covering their entire populations. Why should Americans not enjoy the same health rights as citizens of other countries around the globe? Why does the US have a lower life expectancy than Costa Rica (which has UHC), and a higher maternal mortality rate than Kazakhstan? Why should health care costs remain the biggest cause of bankruptcy in the US, thwarting the hopes and ambitions of hardworking families? The answer is quite simple: commercial self-interest. The US healthcare industry, pharmaceutical companies and private insurance firms have assiduously lobbied for decades at state and federal levels to protect their business interests. Their spokespeople and spin doctors distort arguments, so that concepts that are commonplace in almost every other industrialized country are portrayed as outlandish and dangerous. Challenging this consensus takes political courage and commitment. President Obama’s health reforms were a step in the right direction, especially in making health insurance mandatory, and not allowing insurance companies to exclude people with pre-existing conditions. Millions of American women also benefited from accessing free family planning services on their health insurance plans thanks to the Affordable Care Act. But the tide has turned in the White House over the past twelve months, leading the health care debate into treacherous waters. President Trump seems intent on dismantling his predecessor’s reforms, through successive executive orders, including a halt on federal funding to provide health insurance coverage for nine million vulnerable children. What gives us hope, however, is that the American people do not agree with this approach. A recent poll in The Economist shows that 60 percent of Americans want to see publicly-funded Medicare expanded to cover all citizens, and some political leaders are beginning to respond to their voters’ concerns. States including California, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont and New York are all seeing moves to bring publicly-financed UHC at a state level. We urge them to lead the way. The chaos and paralysis surrounding health reform on Capitol Hill must not be an excuse for vested interests to regain the initiative and block progress. Responsible leaders and citizens must come together and demand Americans enjoy the same rights to health as their fellow global citizens. The Elders will stand in solidarity with you to make Jefferson’s dream a reality.","NOVEMBER 8, 2017"
Health Care Bill: When America's Insurance Problem Started | Time,6153,"W
ith Senate Republicans planning to introduce a new version of a health care bill on Thursday, in their latest attempt to find a way to fulfill the promise to repeal former President Obama’s signature health care law, it’s as clear as ever that, in the words of President Donald Trump, health care is “so complicated.” But, while those complications are traced by some to President Obama’s impact on the system or a half-century back to the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, an even earlier moment is really at the heart of the problem, says Christy Ford Chapin, author of Ensuring America’s Health: The Public Creation of the Corporate Health Care System. It was in 1938, she argues, that the structural problems with the U.S. health care system began. In order to understand why 1938 is the key year, it helps to understand how people paid for and thought about health care before that point. Though people had been seeking help from healers since time immemorial, a great deal had changed around the turn of the 20th century. As germ theory became widely accepted, vaccines became more widely used and hospitals became safer, demand for trained and licensed doctors expanded — and so did the influence of regulating bodies like the American Medical Association (AMA). So, as more people wanted to go to more expensive doctors, they began to get creative. In the years before health insurance was the norm, Americans came up with all kinds of ways to pay for care. Free care at places like charity clinics and dispensaries was sometimes available, and barter was not uncommon. (“The image of the doctor accepting eggs or a pair of boots — that’s very true,” says Chapin.) And doctors often practiced a kind of sliding-scale fee system, in which they treated the poor for very little but expected their wealthier patients to pay more, subsidizing care for the community. But it wasn’t hard for patients to see that there would be a benefit to figuring out a way to pay smaller amounts more regularly rather than waiting for an emergency — the same logic by which insurance operates today. Mutual-aid societies and union welfare funds often stepped in to provide that kind of service, and some doctors arranged their own multispecialty group practices, some of which allowed patients to pay a set premium for access. The option that was not available, however, was to pay for service through a large insurance company. Those insurance companies did exist, especially after the tax structure changed in 1913, but the insurers mostly provided group life insurance and pension plans to big businesses. Chapin found in her archival research that such companies did often ask the insurers to cover their employees’ health too — in part as a way to prevent employees from seeing their unions as the providers of wellness — but that the insurers refused, seeing health as a risky and complicated field they were better off without. Meanwhile, medical authorities like the AMA watched these changes with trepidation. In their view, all of these options — union, physician groups, insurance — were a bad idea. “At that time, the AMA was against health insurance in general,” Chapin explains. “They didn’t want any other agent involved in the physician-patient relationship because they were worried that financier would become more and more powerful and end up reducing the physician’s sovereignty.” In order to enforce that stance, the AMA threatened doctors with the loss of crucial professional support if they took part in the payment systems that were blossoming at the time. (For example, Chapin says, membership in the medical society affected whether a doctor could obtain malpractice coverage.) By 1938, however, they could see that such a stance was a losing proposition. With the nation in the grips of the Great Depression and President Franklin Roosevelt helping to change American expectations about citizens’ relationship with government, providing for the people’s health seemed to many to be a natural step for government to undertake. As TIME reported in 1938, “Hard times for doctors and patients [and] changing social attitudes have caused doctors to consider new ways of distributing medical care.” Fearful that the profession would be “federalized,” the doctors’ group finally agreed — to the surprise of many — that some form of insurance was necessary. But, as Chapin points out, they only agreed to that change on their own specific terms. And, on the idea that big insurance companies were less likely to interfere with doctor sovereignty, it was in 1938 that they picked the insurance model as the only option they would allow, setting out conditions with which the doctors and the insurers would have to comply, like the requirement of a fee-for-service model. Though the insurers had long balked at the idea and predicted that the result would be chaotic, they had little choice when faced with the entire medical establishment as well as the idea that the other option was socialism. These early insurance policies were “meager, stingy [and] barely covered anything,” Chapin says. A policy, for example, might cover 10 specific diseases and nothing else. But that was enough to set a precedent that the U.S. is still building on today, even though it was problematic from the start. As soon as the insurance companies were in the business of health — and especially as fears of socialism grew in the post-World War II U.S. — they had political reasons to expand coverage in order to prove that private industry was capable of dealing with health, even when the business math didn’t work out and costs quickly ballooned. Eventually, the insurance-company model started to seem like the obvious choice for Americans — even though the nation had once been full of many alternative models. Chapin, for one, believes that the model of multispecialty group practices with flat fees would likely have prevailed if the American health care market had been allowed to develop on its own without that 1938 decision. “The basic problem is the role that insurance companies have grown into,” Chapin says. “It wasn’t meant to be that way.”","UPDATED: JULY 13,"
Biden Left Big Health Care Reforms Out of American Families Plan ...,7307,"D
uring President Joe Biden’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, he called for an ambitious health agenda that would allow the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices, expand Medicare coverage, build on the Affordable Care Act and lower deductibles. All of these ideas would transform the way Americans pay for health care—but most of them are not actually in the legislative plan the President has put forward. “Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And, by the way, that won’t just help people on Medicare. It will lower prescription drug costs for everyone,” Biden said. “We’ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.” Despite his strong rhetoric, Biden’s American Families Plan, also unveiled on Wednesday, does not include the proposals to cut prescription drug costs or lower the Medicare eligibility age, which congressional Democrats had pressured him to include in recent weeks. His $4 trillion package comprised of the American Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan has been praised by progressives as a huge investment in the country’s economy and social safety net. But the omission of these larger health care policies has raised questions for progressives about the President’s commitment to the ideas in the face of opposition from Republicans, moderate Democrats and pharmaceutical companies. “While [lowering drug prices and expanding Medicare] is a focused priority of Congress, it’s clear it’s not as much so for the White House,” says Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, which supports the drug pricing and Medicare reforms. Biden’s plan does include $200 billion to make permanent the increased premium subsidies for people who buy health coverage on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace, which were passed in the American Rescue Plan earlier this year. The expanded subsidies mean that millions of Americans are eligible for cheaper or free health coverage. But the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the subsidies will get just 1.3 million uninsured people to buy coverage over two years, a small portion of the total uninsured. “In terms of federal dollars, subsidizing private insurance is the most expensive way you can go about getting people covered. Whereas doing it through a public option or Medicaid or Medicare is much lower cost on a per person basis,” says Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. That is a main reason why many congressional Democrats have been pushing Biden to do more than shore up the ACA. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 16 other Senators sent a letter to Biden on April 25 calling for the President to address drug pricing, lower the Medicare eligibility age, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare and expand Medicare benefits to cover hearing, dental and vision care. Another group of more than 80 House members, including progressives like Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal and moderates like Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania and Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, wrote a similar letter advocating for the government to negotiate drug prices and expand Medicare. A new set of analyses from the Kaiser Family Foundation this week indicate that lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 or even lower could bring down U.S. health spending overall. The foundation’s first analysis showed that when people turn 65, their health care spending drops significantly from the period between age 60 to 64 despite the fact that most people use more health care as they age. The reason? Medicare pays lower prices for health care services than private insurers. Employers also benefit. The foundation’s second analysis showed that if people ages 60-64 were no longer enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance, the cost for employer plans could drop by 15%. Even if Medicare expanded to include dental, vision and hearing coverage as Sanders and some Democrats want, Kaiser Family Foundation’s Cox says health spending could still drop. Polling has shown that both of these policies are popular, even among Republican voters. And congressional Democrats say that is especially true after the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected older Americans. But by far the most popular item that Democrats are pushing is the proposal to allow the U.S. government to negotiate with manufacturers over drug prices—something that most other developed countries already do. A new government study commissioned by Sanders and released this week shows that the U.S. pays two to four times more for prescription drugs than other wealthy countries, adding to the evidence supporting the Democrats’ position. Even though these policies are popular among voters, the political reality for Biden is more difficult. Republicans oppose most of Biden’s spending on the social safety net, so the legislation will likely need to pass through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow Democrats to push it through along party lines. But with an evenly-divided Senate, they can’t afford to lose any votes. The ACA subsidies that Biden has included in his plan face no opposition from Democrats or the health insurance industry, but both the drug pricing reform and Medicare changes will face intense pushback from pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and medical providers, as well as more moderate Democrats. Health care has been a winning topic for Democrats in recent election cycles and bringing down drug prices could be particularly helpful ahead of the next midterms, says Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis who studies public opinion about health care. If Biden isn’t prioritizing that, “it must be because there’s one or two votes in the Senate who have an interest that’s more worried about the pharmaceutical industry than what it’s going to look like in the 2022 election,” he says. Democrats can still fight to add the drug pricing proposal and Medicare changes into the spending package once it gets to Congress. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that the provisions would be in the legislation “if I have anything to say about it,” while Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden of Oregon said he would “look at every possible vehicle” to get drug pricing done. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Frank Pallone of New Jersey said drug pricing would be one of his top priorities as the plan makes its way through the House. House Democrats passed their signature drug pricing legislation, known as H.R. 3, back in 2019, and the bill was recently reintroduced and has a hearing scheduled in Pallone’s committee. Advocates believe that lawmakers can negotiate to put measures like this into the American Families Plan. “We have a container that can fit what we want in there,” said Lawson of Social Security Works. Still, Biden’s speech Wednesday hinted at how difficult these big health care changes can be. “We know how to do this. The last president had that as an objective,” he said, referencing former President Donald Trump’s failed push to lower prescription drug prices. Now Biden has left it up to Democratic lawmakers to get their own colleagues on board and make the changes happen.","APRIL 29, 2021"
Ebola Healthcare Workers Are Dying Faster Than Their Patients | Time,10136,"W
hen Dr. Olivet Buck became the fourth Sierra Leone doctor to die from Ebola after she was denied evacuation, the third American healthcare worker to contract Ebola in West Africa was well on the way to recovery back in Omaha, Nebraska. For many African healthcare workers, who form the bulk of the aid team, a lack of funding has prevented their medical evacuations to Europe or the U.S., where treatment and facilities are more robust. For Western workers, though, systems are already in place for those who become infected with Ebola. And the procedures are, comparatively, fairy tales. Patients are whisked away in futuristic medical evacuation planes. Doctors rush to approve the use of experimental drugs. They will live to tell their story, or so it has been reassured in the U.S. after the nation’s first confirmed Ebola patient. But most Ebola-infected healthcare workers will not be as lucky as Dr. Rick Sacra, or his fellow American Ebola survivors, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly. While one would think that healthcare workers, of all people, would be less likely to succumb to Ebola if they contracted the virus, the fatality rate of Ebola-infected healthcare workers is a stunning 57%, according to WHO’s most recent data. Even more remarkable is that the overall case fatality rate of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak is 47%, and the two rates appear only to be diverging. (A chi-squared test shows the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, meaning it is unlikely this discrepancy is due to chance.) WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic cautioned that the numbers are not perfect, but said they do illuminate a significant trend: Why are healthcare workers just as easily, if not more easily, falling victim to the virus they’ve set out to defeat?   Dr. Buck’s story, like similar cases, suggests an insufficiency of resources—or what some have alleged to be a “callous lack of compassion”—to care for the African nationals who are the backbone of the Ebola aid force. “[The discrepancy in fatality rates] is a natural occurrence, because healthcare workers are the ones who are dealing with patients infected with Ebola,” WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said. “We haven’t had good enough facilities in the countries to treat healthcare workers themselves.” As citizens of Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea—the three main Ebola-affected countries—many of these workers are not operating under the shelter of organizations like WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Many locals are also working in poorer clinics that lack ancillary personnel, or proper sanitation practices, isolation units or supplies, all of which are more readily available in clinics established by international agencies. “An MSF center is sort of like going to the supermarket, and buying a ready-made meal,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an infectious disease expert who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone this summer. “It comes with everything you need.” Out of more than 200 total healthcare worker deaths, MSF has lost only a few workers, an MSF coordinator told reporters in Liberia two weeks ago, revealing for the first time the group’s exposure. WHO, which has had at least one worker become infected, has a policy to evacuate its own staff if they become infected with Ebola, Epstein said. But the agency cannot provide the personnel, resources or money to evacuate local workers. “We’re not the emergency evacuation service,” Epstein added. “We barely have enough money to send people out as it is.” While WHO’s data does not delineate foreign and local healthcare worker infections, Bausch, who is also a frequent WHO consultant, said that only around 10 of the over 300 total worker infections are expatriates. The rest are local African workers. Part of that difference is because there are simply more local workers, said Dr. Susan McLellan, a Tulane professor who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone in August, but the other part is the sheer nature of being a WHO staffer: “We specifically were not resource-poor.” And if a WHO doctor were to fall sick, Bausch described an unspoken promise between the agency and its staff: “If I try to recruit you as a healthcare worker to go to Sierra Leone in relatively rough circumstances to treat people with a dangerous disease, it’s hard for me not to say, ‘well, we’re going to take care of you.'” But between local workers, that same promise of care, while equally sincere, is less dependable. In Kenema, Sierra Leone, where Tulane professor Dr. John Schieffelin arrived under WHO to treat Ebola patients, each worker’s infection was a resounding blow to the local staff’s efforts not only to maintain care for patients, but also for each other. “When they see one of their colleagues fall ill, it’s not just personally devastating because it’s one of their colleagues. It’s also very unnerving for them because they all took the same precaution,” Schieffelin said. “Sometimes, a lot of the staff may not show up for work for a couple of days because they were emotionally distraught about the situation.” Bausch recalled similar memories of when he and another doctor put on their protective suits, traveled to a Sierra Leone Ebola ward and discovered that they were the only two staff in a clinic of 60 Ebola patients. There was stool, vomit, blood and even patients on the floor. The nurses had gone on strike to demand better worker healthcare after some had fallen ill with Ebola. “In some places it’s a very negative cycle,” he said. “You have a nurse who gets sick, and the morale and willingness of the rest of the staff to keep working often goes down. Then even fewer people are working in the ward, and it gets more dangerous.” Of the three main Ebola-affected countries, Sierra Leone has the highest healthcare worker fatality rate of 71%, a figure that has spiked in recent weeks. It is more than twice the country’s overall case fatality rate of 27%. (The difference is extremely statistically significant at the 0.0001 level.)   For comparison, Liberia’s and Guinea’s healthcare worker fatality rates are 51% and 52%, respectively, and they are lower than the countries’ overall fatality rates.     Jasarevic, who recently returned from visiting clinics in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, denied that there are problems specifically affecting Sierra Leone’s healthcare workers. Bausch and Schieffelin also believe the problems they observed in healthcare worker Ebola infections are not endemic to Sierra Leone. Dr. Susan McLellan, a Tulane professor who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone in August, said that it is difficult to compare conditions that are “abysmal” and “so far below what really needs to happen.” But Sierra Leone has, however, lost the most number of local doctors, with Dr. Buck being the latest, according to several reports. The nation also has a steadily increasing number of new reported Ebola cases each week, unlike Guinea and Liberia, where figures have occasionally flatlined, according to WHO’s latest data. Sierra Leone is also the country where MSF provides the lowest bed capacity, despite being the second hardest-hit country, according to data provided by MSF spokesman Tim Shenk. Regardless of what McLellan called “a trick of the numbers,” the alarmingly high number of worker fatalities is driving a new treatment strategy that focuses on preserving the most valuable resources: the workers. Epstein said the “priority” of the U.S. troops deployed to West Africa was to establish treatment centers in Liberia, specifically for healthcare workers, and not patients, a project that Jasarevic confirmed has not yet broken significant ground. “Putting up hospitals specifically for healthcare workers is an inequity of care, but it’s one of the only ways that one can convince people that they will be taken care of if they get sick in as good a manner that can be provided,” said McLellan. “It was my safety first, their care next.” Still, treatment of ill healthcare workers is generally secondary to preventing their infection, the sources of which are too plenty to count, especially for local workers. TIME reported, for example, that a Liberian ambulance worker was rushing to transport a sick child, who vomited on his suit, and didn’t stop to disinfect himself with a full-body chlorine spray. In another case, Epstein recalled a dispatch from a WHO doctor working in a hospital where 25 of the 28 local nurses were infected with Ebola, due to either poor protection, inadequate sanitation, or even a careless needle stick. McLellan added that local staff were routinely called upon by their families to treat potential cases in their homes, where there isn’t adequate protection. “There’s generally an assumption [local healthcare workers] get infected in the Ebola wards, but we really don’t know for sure if they’re getting infected in the wards, or out in the community, or while working in other clinics,” Schieffelin said. While WHO cautions that its data may not be fully representative, several doctors said the healthcare worker fatality rate may mitigate the problem of precisely estimating the overall Ebola fatality rate, which is almost impossible to know. But Ebola in healthcare workers has a stronger documentation. They are trained to spot symptoms and less likely to resist care. They also generally receive treatment alongside their patients in the same clinics that employed them. “[The healthcare worker fatality rate] is more likely to be truly reflective of what’s going on,” Bausch said. “It’s probably a little bit more of a true [overall] case fatality rate.” And in that case—if patients are actually falling victim to Ebola as fast as healthcare workers—then the Ebola outbreak is even more dire that what’s currently reported. The CDC estimated that there could be 1.4 million Ebola cases by January if there is no significant additional intervention. And some doctors are urging, with warranted selfishness, that this extra help be provided to their own. “We feel like we owe that to healthcare workers,” Bausch said. “We owe it to them for taking on these dangerous jobs.”","OCTOBER 3, 2014"
Report: Cost of HealthCare.Gov Approaching $1 Billion | Time,4368,"Correction appended July 30, 9:22 p.m. ET Federal officials badly managed the development of a website to sell health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, potentially costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns, according to testimony that will be delivered to a House subcommittee on Thursday. In prepared remarks posted online Wednesday, William T. Woods, an official at the General Accounting Office, says HealthCare.gov, a federal website charged with managing new individual health plans for consumers in 36 states, was marred by inadequate oversight by officials from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an HHS agency in charge of the insurance website, “undertook the development of HealthCare.gov and its related systems without effective planning or oversight practices, despite facing a number of challenges that increased both the level of risk and the need for effective oversight,” according to Woods. Details of Woods’ testimony were first reported by the Associated Press. The GAO conducted its investigation of HealthCare.gov at the request of the Investigations and Oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. As became obvious in the days and weeks after HealthCare.gov launched on Oct. 1, 2013, the website was hobbled by technical problems and software glitches that prevented consumers from signing up for health plans until a repair effort was undertaken months later. The episode was a significant embarrassment for the Obama Administration, which had promised buying health plans through the website would be akin to purchasing any other goods or services on the Internet. Contractors charged with building HealthCare.gov and a data hub meant to verify identities, eligibility and income used to calculate federal subsidies had not completed their work by the time the site launched, according to Woods’ testimony. But the GAO placed blame on federal officials for not anticipating problems that would occur and for incurring significant cost increases as well as improperly approving additional spending. According to Woods’ testimony, the cost of building one part of HealthCare.gov increased from $56 million to more than $209 million between September 2011 and February 2014. Expenses for the associated data hub ballooned from $30 million to $85 million. Woods says that by March 2014, CMS reported “obligating $840 million for the development of HealthCare.gov and its supporting systems.” Federal officials, according to Woods, delayed assessing whether HealthCare.gov was ready for launch from March 2013 to September 2013, noting that this was just weeks before the site went live. Software experts have said in the months since HealthCare.gov launched and crashed that such a short window is far too narrow to evaluate a brand new, complex system like a new national website to sell health insurance and dole out federal subsidies to those who qualify. As it became clear that the building of HealthCare.gov was not going smoothly, Woods says federal officials approved additional expenditures to contractors, including CGI Federal, the lead company hired to build the website. The GAO, he says, found approximately 40 instances in which CMS employees approved additional spending totaling $30 million. “This is not to say the work was not necessary,” says Woods, “however, the work was not approved properly.” As HealthCare.gov’s launch approached and CMS officials had the chance to withhold major funds from contractors, they chose not to. To save HealthCare.gov after its failed launch, HHS hired the firm Accenture to continue work on the website. But that contract, too, has cost far more than planned. According to Woods’ testimony, the $91 million contract awarded to Accenture in January 2014 increased to $175 million by June 5. Eventually, HealthCare.gov was repaired and some 8 million Americans signed up for health plans through the federal website and 14 others run by individual states by the spring of 2014. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described how 8 million people signed up for new health care plans following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. They used the exchange created by the federal government, Healthcare.Gov, and 14 exchanges run by the individual states.","JULY 30, 2014"
Relaxation and Meditation Could Cut Healthcare Costs | Time,3294,"W
hen stress sneaks into the body, it doesn’t confine itself to the mind. Back pain, insomnia, acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome are all physical manifestations of stress. In fact, up to 70% of a physician’s caseloads stem from stress-related problems, and in the U.S., they’re the third highest healthcare expenditure—right after heart disease and cancer. But a little disciplined R&R may be able to cut into some of it, suggests a large new study published in the journal PLOS ONE. After people took an eight-week relaxation program, their use of clinical services dropped by 43% and they saved thousands of dollars in healthcare costs. “We’ve had a lot of data over the years showing that this stuff helps people’s physiology, their heart rate, blood pressure and inflammation all the way down to the genetic level, but we haven’t really looked at it from the health-systems perspective,” says principal investigator Dr. James Stahl, section chief of general internal medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. “If someone is feeling well and healthier, they wouldn’t want to use the emergency room as often, and the study really bore that out.” Stahl and his team studied a mind-body medicine program at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), called the Benson-Henry Institute’s Relaxation Response Resiliency Program. Using a large database pulling from a network of hospitals, including MGH and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, they looked at about four years’ worth of data from 4,400 people who received relaxation and resiliency training. The eight-week program, which meets weekly for about three hours, focuses on relaxation—through meditation, yoga and stress-reduction exercises—and resiliency-building, through social support, cognitive skills training and positive psychology. After the intervention, the relaxation group used 43% fewer medical services than they had in the previous year. When the researchers did a second analysis comparing the relaxation group to a control group of people with identical medical-services usage rates at the beginning, the effect was still strong: a 25% drop in clinical services. MORE: You Asked: What’s The Best Stress-Relief Method? In cost, too, relaxing paid off. A standard mind-body class runs about $500, while a typical emergency room visit can cost $4,000 at the low end, Stahl says. The intervention group went to the emergency room less than the control group did, saving about $2,360 per patient each year. Overall, a relaxation intervention like this one would save anywhere from $640-$25,500 per patient each year, they estimate. “Currently we’re in a system of a downward spiral,” says Stahl, citing the fee-for-service business model that puts pressure on physicians to see more patients in less time, leading to poorer care. But making people feel well reduces the demand on the healthcare system. “That in turn helps the providers not burn out and have more time to spend with their patients and do a better job,” Stahl says. “There are many medical fads,” Stahl says. “What we’re trying to get down to: Is this real? Is it something that’s sustainable and reproducible? The answer is yes. Here the data is pretty unequivocal that doing these kinds of tools would really help you in terms of your health and wellness.”","OCTOBER 13, 2015"
GoFundMe CEO: One-Third of Fundraisers Are for Medical Costs ...,2474,"O
ne-third of all donations on the popular fundraising site GoFundMe goes towards health care costs, the company’s CEO told CBS News. Founded in 2010, GoFundMe helps users create fundraisers for dozens of categories, including education, faith and business. Nearly 250,000 campaigns have been set up through the site to help pay for health care costs, raising $650 million in contributions, according to the company’s website. Solomon said he never expected such a large portion of campaigns to be focused on health care. “When we started in 2010, it wasn’t purposefully set up and built to be a substitute for medical insurance,” Solomon told CBS MoneyWatch. “We weren’t ever set up to be a health care company and we still are not. But over time, people have used GoFundMe for the most important issues they are faced with.” Over the past few years, crowdfunding — raising small amounts of money from a large number of donors online — has become one of the main ways families seek to pay medical expenses. One possible reason for the rising demand in crowdfunding health care costs could be the drop in health insurance coverage in recent years. According to a new report from Gallup, uninsured rates in the U.S. have reached a four-year high, with nearly 13.7% adults in the U.S. reporting they are uninsured. Coverage is at its lowest since the Affordable Care Act’s individual health insurance mandate was put into effect in 2014, Gallup said. According to the report, about seven million more adults are without health insurance since the number started rising in 2016. During the recent government shutdown, furloughed workers turned to GoFundMe to help pay for medical expenses, including CPT Amy Chandler who need help funding her battle with breast cancer and a Maryland grandfather seeking help for his diabetic granddaughter. Solomon told CBS that the site has turned into a “take action button” for a number of causes. “People want to help, and we actually solve big problems,” Solomon said. “While we didn’t set out to be one of the most influential health care companies in the world, if we have to serve that purpose, I feel very proud about that.” Correction, Jan. 30 The original version of this story misstated the source of the information that nearly 250,000 GoFundMe campaigns have been set up through the site to help pay for health care costs, raising $650 million in contributions.

What It's Like to Be a Health Care Worker During Coronavirus | TIME,16377,"I
n the midst of a global coronavirus pandemic, health care workers are risking their lives to protect the lives of others. Missed opportunities, misguided leadership, and missing supplies have left many balancing their sense of duty with the increasing risks of the job. Here, as part of TIME’s new issue, workers across the health care field share their motivations and frustrations in their own voices Kenya Blackburn, 49, is a Certified Nursing Assistant at a nursing home in Livonia, Mich. When I first started off doing this, I was about 19. And it was so exciting to me because I was helping somebody, and they were happy to always see me, so they made me happy. I loved it. It has changed remarkably [because of the pandemic]. It’s more stressful. It’s depressing. It’s always been short of staffing, but now it’s really short of staffing because the workers are very, very scared. I usually care for about 17 residents during a shift, but now I’m caring for about 25 at a time in the isolated unit for residents with fevers. You don’t know if you’re going to take [the virus] home to your family or not. I have two children—16 and 18—and a 1-year-old grandbaby that I worry about all the time. I have a designated place where I take my uniform off and my shoes off to keep my family safe. I come in, go directly to the basement, where I already have a change of clothes, strip all my clothes off, put all of my clothes directly into the washing machine. Then there’s my mom — I’m her only child now, so that’s a big scare because who’s going to take care of her? It’s very scary for my family. They don’t want me to go back to work. But I have to go to work because I have to be able to take care of my family, and I tell them that my residents need me. For us to see patients that we took care of for years and years get sick is really heartbreaking. Facing the residents, the ones that are sick, trying to keep a straight face to keep their spirits up — that’s my biggest challenge. They don’t know if they’re ever going to see their family again. They don’t want to die. I try to keep their spirits up, pray with them, say ‘Everything will be OK.’ When all this is over, a lot of us are probably going to need to seek counseling because the people at the nursing home are just like family. —As told to Katie Reilly Dani Ibarra-Ramirez, 30, is an ER nurse at South Side Chicago Hospital in Chicago, Ill. The hospital hasn’t done much for mental health outreach. But I have made some really great friends just working in the ER—family members, honestly. Through this pandemic so far, the bonding has been insane. There’s no one else who can really understand the amount of anxiety that I’m experiencing. Personally, I’m way past fear of getting sick. My biggest concern now is just what I’m going to witness as we keep getting more and more cases. As of a few days ago, we were already intubating multiple patients, sometimes at the same time—”the intubation corner,” is what we had called it. I’m at a trauma center, so we do get a lot of gunshots, stab wounds, car accidents. Still, it’s pretty rare to have to intubate multiple patients per shift. I go back tonight. I’m mentally preparing myself to go back to a harsher reality. Part of me knows it may be a busier, more unsafe environment for the employees, but also for the patients, just given the lack of resources and the limited number of people that we do have. PPE has been rationed for weeks now. I personally started reusing things before the CDC told us to. I knew that this was headed this way, and it always feels like there has to be a huge process to get more supplies. Even right now, we’re basically rationing wipes to disinfect our computer stations and our equipment, which is terrifying. I’m hoping that when I go in tonight they’ve figured out a way to get more. At the same time, I’m staying optimistic. I’ve been doing a lot of de-stressing while I’m off—a lot of exercise, a lot of sleep, a lot of socializing through FaceTime and other apps. That’s all been very helpful and is keeping me grounded. I’ve been making it a rule to only listen to the news and catch up on the numbers and the new guidelines once a day, in the morning, and then the rest of the day trying not to think about it. Laughter is medicine for the patients, but also for the caregivers. Little things at this time will make a big difference. I’m not going to lie: early last week, when the ordered quarantine first went into effect here in Illinois, there was a moment I was laying on my couch and I had crippling anxiety. I could not move. But otherwise, I feel like this is my duty. Especially working in the ER, I signed up for the unknown. There are a lot of reasons to feel fear right now, but never has fear helped me. Fear just gets in the way of being reasonable and rational. As scary as this is, other people are relying on us. We have to support each other in remaining hopeful and optimistic. —As told to Jamie Ducharme Tanya Lynne Robinson, 55, is a home health aide in Cleveland, Ohio When you talk about the front lines, some people just look at doctors and nurses in hospitals, but we’re out here going to strangers’ homes. I never know what environment I’m going into. I don’t know who’s been in and out of these people’s homes. I’m mopping, I’m cleaning, I’m sweeping, I’m vacuuming, I’m running errands, I’m preparing breakfast, I’m preparing lunch, I’m preparing dinner. When you’re caring for clients, you bathe them, you clean them, you put the briefs back on them. My first client of the day, I have to clean her from head to toe while she’s in bed. You’re exposed to all of this. I have multiple sclerosis, which is an autoimmune disease, but I try not to worry. My supervisors are so appreciative of anything I do because of my MS diagnosis. They’ll call and see how I’m doing throughout the day. Every month they provide us a box of gloves and hand sanitizer. But there’s no extra protective equipment right now because hospitals are priority. I try to be as safe as I can. I’m like, “Please, God, just cover me.” My daughter contracted the virus. Her manager at her job had it. As soon as she had a sniff, she self-isolated just in case. I let my boss know, because that’s the responsible thing to do. I self-isolated for a few days. We have to take our temperatures in the morning and we have to report it. If your temperature is high, we don’t go to our clients. But [our clients], they were in a bad situation before the virus. If I don’t go help them, who’s going to go help them? These are people that need help. You do what you can do and you trust God to do the rest. —As told to Jamie Ducharme Sara, 42, is an emergency room doctor at Hospital el Escorial in Madrid, Spain It feels like we’re being played for fools. As the COVID-19 pandemic has advanced, and the number of cases has gone up, and the cases have gotten more severe, [Spanish] authorities are somehow telling us we need a lower level of protection. A month ago, it was compulsory to wear impermeable overalls and a high quality mask even for lower risk tasks. Not anymore. If you’re not getting close to a patient and you’re not doing certain tasks, they say you just need a surgical mask and normal overalls. Now we reuse overalls again and again when normally we’d change every time we go on a break or see a new patient. It greatly increases the risk that you’ll get infected. I don’t think about it when I’m treating patients. But the falling standards make me feel unsafe. I worry about infecting my husband and my kids. I have colleagues who are in the ICU, with serious cases of COVID-19. Right now I’m isolating myself at home because I have a slight fever. I’ve tested negative, but since I’ve been exposed I can’t go back to the hospital until my fever comes down. A doctor’s job is to look after patients. The role of managers is to manage. I know it must be really difficult for authorities to ensure we have resources at the moment. But it’s their job. There should be a better way to do it. Other countries have been able to do it better. When you see images of health workers in China—though perhaps these are the ones they want us to see—they have full protective suits and they wear two separate layers. We only wear one layer, when we have it. Keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter. In Spain, we’ve never had to work like this before. Maybe in other countries where there aren’t many doctors or much equipment, doctors will be used to that. But in Spain we’re not used to working like that and we’re not trained to do it either. It’s really hard. Doctors in the U.S. should prepare for a war. In terms of the number of protective suits you’ll have, the number of hospital beds, the number of ventilators in the ICU—it’s like being a war medic. Try to prepare for that. —As told to Ciara Nugent Read more of Sara’s story. Vanessa, 21, is a hospital housekeeper in Pennsylvania I’ve worked in environmental services—it’s a fancy name for housekeeping—in a Pennsylvania hospital for almost a year. Every patient isolation room, whether it’s for the flu or MRSA or measles, you clean a certain way. Our most severe units we call “purple rooms.” Those ones we clean top to bottom, mop the walls, mop the floors, every single inch of everything in those rooms gets cleaned. We throw out anything that’s disposable, even the rags that we have to use. We don’t know how to clean these COVID rooms. It’s kind of terrifying. We got a letter from our boss that said to just clean them like a flu room, which is just wiping everything down and taking down the cubicles. We also use this giant UV light that’s supposed to kill all the germs in the room. I don’t feel comfortable cleaning them like it’s the flu. We don’t know how contagious this is. How bad is it? When there’s a possible COVID room, they just put up a blue sign. We never know going in if it’s actually flu or COVID. My boss writes a list of who potentially has COVID, but it doesn’t get updated every day. Me and the girl I work with have been cleaning COVID rooms like we do for those purple rooms, mixed with airborne-pathogen rooms where you wear the N95 masks. As of right now it seems to be working. There are not very many N95 masks though. Right now, they’re obviously reserved for doctors and nurses, everyone who takes care of the patients. We have regular masks and some knockoff respirator masks. We only have one respirator mask each and we just spray it after we’re done in the room. I’ve thought of skipping work quite a lot, especially since I do have a weak immune system and I don’t have the best health, but I need money. My roommate just got laid off. It’s a tough time, but neither of us have symptoms or anything, so that’s a good thing. Because I work at the hospital, I’m too afraid to go see my family, and I’m a big mama’s girl. I miss seeing her every day. I am very thankful for all the doctors and nurses putting their lives at risk, it’s very courageous. But at the same time, us housekeepers, we have families too, we have health issues too, we have people and animals we go home to that we could be giving this to. The doctors and nurses have that too, but they get recognized. No one ever mentions the people that clean it up after they’re gone. I really hope that changes, but I highly doubt it will. —As told to Jamie Ducharme Heather Wilson, 37, is a certified Nurse Midwife in Portland, Ore. Women in labor do not want to wear masks. The hallmark of midwifery care is a lot of presence and support and touch and caring connection with women and their families. We really are exposed to every bodily fluid that there is and heavy respirations. We are way closer than 6 feet from them. I do one 24 hour shift a week and am in contact with multiple people potentially in labor. I potentially can be exposed to people for quite a number of hours. This last shift I was wearing new protective equipment that is very heavy and hard to wear, hard to breathe in. My recent shift I was with two different women who gave birth while I was there. I spent nearly 8 hours wearing those face shields. I felt like I was suffocating. I have asthma. I also am in the process of being diagnosed for an immune deficiency. I was very sick over the fall and early wintertime period and had pneumonia and actually broke a rib from coughing. I was out of work a decent amount at that time so I am fairly heightened about another respiratory disease fairly short on the heels of that other experience. I know what it is like to have a respiratory illness and to be experiencing air hunger and just how scary it is to feel like you can’t breathe. I have a young child with asthma as well, so I want to take measures to make myself safe so I can be present for my own family and child and also not bring home something that could potentially endanger him. I juggle this sense of how do I provide the same level of care that I did before, which in reality I can’t, and how I do I keep myself safe and my family safe. I have never been afraid to go into work before, I feel very comfortable being a calm steady presence during birth and facing obstetric complications with my feet firmly planted on the ground. Now I am really feeling like I am struggling with my own sense of anxiety. A lot of people are coming in who are infected and we won’t know, so we have to presume that everyone is infected. I think universal testing of all women coming into labor and delivery will be a goal if we have enough tests available to us so that we can appropriately determine how people should be roomed and what kind of precautions should be available. As of now, the recommendations on my unit are that providers or caregivers who enter a patient’s room and have interaction with a patient wear a surgical mask, eye protection, hair coverage and a face shield. If the patient is a person under investigation for COVID or a confirmed positive COVID patient, then additionally gowns and double gloves. The issue with surgical masks is that they are protecting patients from our droplets and respirations but they have significant air leakage, they are not covering with a tight seal on your face. If the coronavirus is aerosolized and air borne—and it seems quite possible that there is quite a bit of air borne transmission—then a surgical mask does not fully protect the caregiver at all from aerosolized droplets or viral content. We are being provided with a surgical mask which is ours to use for the shift that is new and that is wonderful. But it is important to keep in mind that all of these masks are intended for single use. I’ve been so grateful that our institution has been actively seeking out PPE options, but you can’t fabricate what doesn’t exist. They are doing the best that they can, but when you have a finite source and we haven’t hit the surge or the peak of the surge by any stretch, it’s terrifying to think about what happens when that runs out. I was gifted, which I feel so grateful for, an industrial n95 mask from a nurse who took pity on me and said she would feel more comfortable with me having it. I have read about how to sanitize it and will use it until it is no longer safe because it’s disintegrating or is clearly soiled. Women used to be allowed whoever was a supportive presence for them to come in, so we would have large family groups or friend groups who were participating and it was clearly a celebratory event. But now we are unfortunately restricting women to one visitor and no longer have access to our staff doulas which is very challenging. It makes me all the more want to be present with these women because they are craving and needing support and really grieving this sense of loss of community in this major life event that is happening for them. We do the best we can to connect with these laboring women in meaningful ways and we are having to change our own perspective of what that looks like. It’s a really big paradigm shift for midwives and definitely for me. I have been so impressed and heartened by being present with laboring women in this pandemic and how brave they are and how strong they are. It calls me all the more to be there and show up because they desperately need us. —As told to Jennifer Duggan","APRIL 8, 2020"
Democrats' Relief Bill is a Win for the Health Care Industry | Time,18221,"D
emocrats spent months in 2020 debating huge, transformative solutions to America’s broken health care system. They promised to take on the health insurance industry, lower costs, and ensure that no family would go broke paying for the care they needed—and that was even before a once-in-a-century pandemic highlighted the health care system’s existing flaws. But now, with Democrats holding unified control of Washington, the first piece of major legislation likely to land on President Joe Biden’s desk is set to hand the industry billions while doing little to control prices or address other stumbling blocks that prevent people from accessing health care. The new COVID-19 relief package, which Senate Democrats are widely expected to pass within the week, would expand Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies for two years and provide funding to underwrite coverage through COBRA, the program that offers temporary extensions of employer health insurance for workers who lose their jobs. While Biden has endorsed both of these ideas, the package notably omits his more ambitious proposals, including lowering the age of Medicare eligibility and creating a federally-run public health insurance option to compete with private insurers. The relatively moderate reforms come as an alliance between big health care companies and business interests joins forces with Democratic leadership, which has largely focused on shoring up private health insurance by bailing out employer health plans and expanding the ACA. (The package also includes incentives for the remaining 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid to do so, although it’s up to largely Republican-led state governments to take Congress up on its offer.) The outcome is a relief to the health care industry. At a moment when some lobbyists were worried that the effects of the pandemic—combined with Democratic control in Congress—would give progressives traction to push for Medicare for All or a public health insurance option, the current relief bill does neither. “The framework that we have in place is a solid one. And we can close the coverage gaps that continue to exist using that framework without some sort of more fundamental change to how people in this country get their health care coverage,” says Molly Smith, group vice president for public policy at the American Hospital Association. Progressives, meanwhile, are disappointed. They see the incremental health care reforms as a missed opportunity: Health care analysts argue that the government could cover more people for far less money by enrolling them in Medicaid or Medicare rather than offering subsidies on the private market. And some activists worry the current focus on private insurance further entrenches the problematic, employer-based system and allows the powerful health care industry to kick calls for broader reform down the road. “These are all temporary fixes,” says Rep. Ro Khanna of California, an outspoken advocate for single-payer health care who supported the package despite “vehemently” disagreeing with the COBRA provision. “The reality is that most Americans are going to see that their costs are continuing to go up, their premiums are going up, their co-pays are going up, their deductibles are going up. And their care is being restricted.” The U.S. health care system has been built on employer-based health insurance for decades. Some 160 million Americans got their health insurance through their job in 2019. But the COVID-19 pandemic called into question the wisdom of that system. With businesses shuttering and tens of millions of people out of work, many Americans suddenly found themselves without access to health care as a viral pandemic swamped the nation. Researchers estimate as many as 15 million Americans and their dependents lost insurance through their jobs last year. Progressives seized the moment to push their long-standing message that the employer-based model is broken, and the Democratic primary was dominated by a debate over two potentially enormous health care transformations, Medicare for All or a public option. The $3.8 trillion health care industry, for its part, was also in upheaval. While coronavirus patients overwhelmed the health system, many hospitals and providers saw profits collapse as people avoided routine medical care for months and elective procedures were cancelled. Health insurers, meanwhile, raked in record profits. The disparity helped underscore a politically tricky reality: while some providers and patients benefit from the private health care system, others do not. Hospitals, doctors, insurers and employer groups were poised to defend private insurance, while health care advocates and providers who treat the uninsured argued for expanding government-run health care, which offers lower reimbursement rates but could cover those without other options. The tension played out in the Democratic political field. After Biden emerged as the Democratic nominee, he joined with Sen. Bernie Sanders to create a “unity task force,” which ultimately recommended a plan for a public option. The Democrats’ apparent unity around a robust, federally-managed alternative to private health insurance galvanized the health care industry players. After Biden’s election, health care lobbyists, employer-benefits groups and some unions stepped up efforts to push moderate, but meaningful improvements to the existing, private insurance market, like increasing ACA and COBRA subsidies, in part as a strategy to prevent the expansion of government health care. On Dec. 3, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, two health insurance lobby groups, wrote to Congressional leaders recommending a plan that included expanding ACA subsidies and asking the government to fully cover the cost of COBRA premiums. And in February, the Affordable Coverage Coalition, representing competing interests across the U.S. health system, came together to champion the idea of building on the ACA and other existing programs to reach universal health coverage. The group, which includes major insurers, hospitals, doctors and business lobbies, also endorsed boosting subsidies for the ACA and covering COBRA costs, as well other moves favored by Democrats that would help more people enroll in coverage and incentivize states to expand Medicaid. “From our view, the ACA went a long way, but it needs, like any program, some mid course corrections to reach its aspirations,” says Chip Kahn, president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents for-profit hospitals and is a member of the Affordable Coverage Coalition, along with the American Hospital Association, AHIP and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Over the last four years, Kahn said, Republicans’ focus on repealing and replacing the ACA meant the government chipped away at the law rather than improving it. With Biden now in office and Democrats in control of Congress, the time was ripe to bolster the law. “That’s why we thought it was timely to get together with others in the industry, who we share this view with, that this framework can work for everyone,” he says. While hospitals, doctors and insurers have defended the ACA in the past since they benefit when more people have health insurance, the new coalition also added the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which did not previously support the law. The Chamber joined the coalition because it is “an effort and opportunity to strengthen the private insurance market,” says Katie Mahoney, vice president of health policy at the Chamber. The ACA has been in place for years at this point, she added, so it’s important to ensure the existing system works and to advocate for the continued success of private insurance. “Business wants to have predictability, business wants to be able to innovate and provide the valued benefit of coverage to their employees,” Mahoney says. Many of the coalition’s ideas, including the expanded ACA tax credits and COBRA funding, have made it into Democrats’ COVID-19 relief bill. In non-pandemic times, most workers who have left their jobs try to avoid signing up for COBRA. The premiums can be very expensive without an employer’s assistance, and people who have been laid-off can typically find cheaper coverage through subsidized ACA marketplace plans or Medicaid. But corporations, hospitals, many health care providers and some unions benefit directly from the employer-sponsored health plans and want to make sure they remain after the economy recovers from the pandemic. The system allows corporations to get tax breaks for offering the benefits to their employees; it offers hospitals and doctors higher reimbursement rates than Medicare or Medicaid; and it preserves the often-generous plans unions have negotiated with their companies. In some ways, subsidizing COBRA benefits is a politically safe idea. Many of the 160 million Americans who had workplace health insurance before the pandemic said they generally liked their plans, Biden supports temporarily paying for workplace insurance and Republicans are less likely to fight a plan that props up employer-based private insurance than alternatives that expand government coverage. The House tried including COBRA subsidies in its third stimulus bill last spring, but that package never made it through the Republican controlled Senate at the time. This time around, the Senate parliamentarian has ruled the COBRA provisions can be included in bills passed under the budget reconciliation process, the mechanism that Congress is using to pass COVID-19 relief and that requires a simple majority vote, so the idea seems destined to stay the final package. It’s not just the COBRA provision that is aimed at avoiding more public health coverage, though. Many of the groups in the new coalition are also part of a different advocacy group, Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, which started in 2018 with the goal of pushing back on Medicare for All. It now opposes all forms of a public option. The Partnership ran a seven-figure ad campaign attacking Medicare for All in 2020 and launched ads opposing Biden’s public option during the Democratic National Convention. “The work we did, in terms of raising the issues we did in the Partnership about these other types of coverage was prescient,” says Kahn, of the Federation of American Hospitals, who helped start the Partnership. “It was the right time to start working on those issues, and to try to get people to focus on the Obamacare framework, rather than all these add ons, changes in policy.” The Partnership is solely focused on lobbying against any expansion of government coverage. But its members say its work and the work of the Affordable Coverage Coalition are in sync: both believe the country should have a combination of public programs and private coverage, and they see promoting—and buttressing—an employer-backed insurance model as the best way forward. “We’ve got a path to covering everyone in a way that wouldn’t disrupt coverage and care,” says Justine Handelman, senior vice president of policy and representation at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which is a member of both the Affordable Coverage Coalition and the Partnership. “We believe that this is an important step and a down payment on the ACA during the pandemic to ensure that people can afford coverage, and we will be working with Congress to extend that beyond the two years and ideally make it permanent.” Some progressives see Democrats’ willingness to buttress the existing, employer-insurance based system as a missed chance. Medicare for All advocates argue that Democrats should use their new power to aggressively expand the safety net and start making structural changes to the system that exacerbated access to health care during the pandemic rather than allowing it to continue. “Democrats have won control of the federal government, so now there are no more excuses. And the question is are we actually going to fix the health care crisis that got us here?” activist Ady Brarkan asked in a recent video from progressive media outlet More Perfect Union criticizing the COBRA subsidies. “Here’s the frustrating reality. President Biden and congressional Democrats are proposing a solution that doesn’t come close to solving this crisis.” Before the new Congress had even begun, left-wing activists called on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to force a House vote on Medicare for All. Ocasio-Cortez explained that this wouldn’t achieve the left’s desired outcome, but that didn’t satisfy everyone. And while many progressives say they need to build more grassroots support for single-payer health care in order to get more lawmakers onboard, health care activists and outside groups have been clear about demanding more from Congress. In a recent email to supporters, National Nurses United, the nation’s largest nurses union and a powerful champion of Medicare for All, echoed the sentiment, arguing that “the ACA isn’t enough” and that “the only way to truly make health care a human right is through Medicare for All.” Connie Huynh, director of the Health Care for All campaign at progressive advocacy group People’s Action, which also supports Medicare for All, describes the COBRA subsidies as “another corporate bailout” but says she believes the COVID-19 package is “a critical start” that will provide some immediate relief. “It’s something that we need to win now, so that we can open up space for our next opportunities,” she says. She and other progressives are especially frustrated by what they see as the limited scope of the current relief plan. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the House bill would result in 1.3 million people getting insurance coverage next year while the changes to the ACA and COBRA benefits would cost $52.8 billion. The expanded ACA subsidies would make many more people eligible for reduced or free coverage. But part of the problem is reaching those people and helping them navigate hurdles to sign up. And once they’re enrolled, some people will still face high deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and instances where their insurer flat out denies in-network claims. When it comes to COBRA, the House bill proposed covering 85% of the cost of laid off workers keeping their employer plans, but after unions like Unite Here said that wasn’t enough, the Senate plan would have the government cover 100% of COBRA costs. All of these changes are temporary: The COBRA subsidies last just through September and the ACA expansion would be in place for two years. “We should be clear it’s not a long-term solution,“ says Huynh. “We’re putting a spare tire on the car right now. It’s gonna help us get by, but if we think that we can try to drive with a spare tire for too long, the car is going to break down somewhere else.” In the Biden-Sanders unity task force recommendations, Democrats proposed a kind of immediate public health insurance option that could open during the pandemic. Both Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, introduced bills last spring that would allow for emergency expansions of Medicare during the public health crisis. But those ideas lacked the political support to move quickly and by the end of the year, the debate among Democrats was again centered on improving, rather than overhauling, the existing system. This paradigm part of what sociologist Paul Starr calls the “policy trap.” In his 2011 book Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle Over Health Care Reform, Starr writes that when the U.S. created its health financing policies half a century ago, it set up an “increasingly costly and complicated system that has satisfied enough of the public and so enriched the health care industry as to make change extraordinary difficult.” Jayapal, who pushed to include provisions in the relief package that would automatically enroll laid-off workers in public health insurance and tie ACA subsidies to more generous plans, has criticized the industry-based health care reforms in the current bill. “They’ve been naked about their greed to keep the profits for the private insurance industry,” she tells TIME. “I wish we could move quickly and do the long-term structural change that we need, so that everybody in America has health care.” But she still voted for the bill, calling it “urgent” to provide some immediate help. “We have to just use whatever we have right now,” she says. Jayapal says she is continuing to push for more sweeping reforms with both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Biden’s Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice. But it’s an uphill battle. Xavier Becerra, Biden’s pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, was a vocal Medicare for All advocate when he served in Congress, but during his confirmation hearing last week, reassured Republicans that he planned to stick with Biden’s goals to “build on the Affordable Care Act.” Democratic Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet recently reintroduced an updated version of their Medicare-X public option plan—something that progressives say is too moderate, but the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future opposes. FCC filings show the Partnership is already buying ads in Montana and Maine, where Senators who may need to be convinced to nix a Medicare-X plan are from. It also recently tried to run Facebook ads criticizing a public option in those places as well as in West Virginia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and the Washington, D.C. area. Jayapal says she’s ready for a long fight. “I’ve never believed that it’s going to be easy to make any substantial changes to the system. We in Congress are going to have to get a backbone and a spine to stand up for health care for every single person in this country,” she says. “If anything, the fact that they’ve continued to make billions of dollars, both insurance companies and drug companies during this pandemic, is just even more fodder for the mill of why we have to have at least a public option that is administered by Medicare—but in an ideal world, also, a Medicare for All single-payer health care system.”","MARCH 3, 2021"
Why Paying for Nutrition Saves Money on Health Care | Time,3786,"T
he foods we eat play a central role in our health. The epidemics of our time—obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes—are intimately tied to unhealthy patterns of eating. But eating healthy is also expensive, making it particularly challenging for the 12% of US households who have to worry whether they can afford enough food each month. For the 41 million Americans living in these households, a common coping strategy is to purchase cheaper, less healthy foods in an effort to make their food budgets last longer. Over time, however, these unhealthy dietary patterns can have a significant impact on a person’s health. Children living in food-insecure homes suffer two to four times as many health problems and are less likely to reach their academic potential. Pregnant women who are food insecure are more likely to develop gestational diabetes and deliver pre-term or low birth-weight babies. Food-insecure adults are more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease and osteoporosis. The trouble doesn’t stop there. Once you have one of these illnesses, food insecurity often makes that illness harder to manage. One in three Americans with chronic illness has trouble affording food, medication or both. Moreover, the stress of worrying about where your next meal is coming from is associated with depressive symptoms, which only makes the task of managing a complex disease harder. It is not surprising, then, that food insecurity comes with a cost. On average, food insecure people in the U.S. incur an extra $1,800 in medical costs every year, accounting for $77.5 billion in additional health care expenditures. The United States has some of the most robust programs in the world for people facing hunger. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), for example, helps 20.5 million households stretch their budgets to purchase food. Recently, our study team wanted to learn whether SNAP saves money in health care costs. In a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, we found that people who are enrolled in SNAP have health care expenditures that are, on average, $1,400 less per year compared with similar people who are not enrolled in SNAP. Despite this, the White House has proposed cutting SNAP by $193 billion over 10 years—a cut of more than 25%—which would dramatically impact many people’s ability to afford food for themselves and their children. Could these cuts wind up costing more than they save? When SNAP benefits were reduced in 2013, we saw a rise in hospital admissions for dangerously low blood sugar, likely as people with diabetes ran out of food, leading to millions of dollars in extra health care costs. SNAP works. It was designed to decrease food insecurity in the U.S., and it does. Now we are learning that SNAP may protect health, too. This is why cuts to SNAP could be so devastating. In addition to putting millions more people at risk of hunger, these cuts could further strain our health care system, and threaten the public’s health. With so much at stake, cutting SNAP doesn’t make sense.

Where 2020 Democratic Candidates Stand on Health Care | Time,11417,"T
he second Democratic primary debate on Thursday night saw an extended period of serious policy discussion on the future of the nation’s health care. While Medicare-for-all has been the rallying cry of those on the party’s left flank, the candidates on the stage were split, with most arguing against an immediate switch to a single-payer, national government health care program. Early in the night, the debate moderators asked the candidates to raise their hands if they would eliminate private insurance. Only two hands went up: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and California Senator Kamala Harris. (Though Harris softened her stance on Friday, underlining the sensitivity with which Democrats are treating their positions on Medicare-for-all.) As the candidates dug in to their positions, nuanced divides emerged and many challenged their competitors on the practicality of their various proposals. Here is everything we learned about the 2020 Democratic candidates’ health care plans from the debate. Before the debate: Before Thursday’s debate, Biden had not spoken as extensively about his plan for health care as many of his opponents had done. Early in his campaign, he said he supports a public option, and then this month his campaign said his plan would be free for low-income people in states that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After the debate: The former Vice President spoke about his family’s tragic personal stories to underscore the importance of having health care during the debate. He did not dig deep into policy specifics, instead focusing on defending the Affordable Care Act. “The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare, to build on what we did,” Biden said. He also made clear that under his plan, everyone would have a choice to either buy private insurance or ” buy into the exchange to a Medicare like plan.” Before the debate: Sanders has been very clear on his Medicare-for-all plan, which would effectively eliminate private insurance and enroll all U.S. residents in a government-run health care program. After the debate: Unsurprisingly, Sanders raised his hand when the moderators asked who would get rid of private insurance under their health care plan. He aggressively defended his plan when other Democrats criticized it during the debate, telling Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, who advocated for allowing people to keep private insurance, that “people don’t like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan, people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want.” When the moderators asked Sanders at the beginning of the debate whether his plan would raise taxes on the middle class, he initially talked around the question, but then said yes. “People who have healthcare under Medicare-for-all will have no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get,” Sanders said. Before the debate: Harris is a co-sponsor of Sanders’ Medicare-for-all plan, and said during a CNN town hall earlier this year that she would like to eliminate private insurance. However, she has also co-sponsored other more moderate proposals, including ones that would create a public option for people to buy into Medicaid and that would lower Medicare’s eligibility threshold to 50 years old. After the debate: After equivocating on her health care stance during the first round of debates in June, Harris released a new health care proposal in July just ahead of the second set of primary debates. While still called “Medicare for all,” the Senator’s proposal tries to strike a more middle approach and separates her from Sanders’ plan in a few key ways, most notably in how she would handle private insurance. Rather than eliminating private insurance, Harris would reach universal health care by creating a government-run system that still allows private insurers to compete with it. Under her plan, which would transition in over 10 years instead of the four years in Sanders’ plan, private insurers could offer plans if they met tightly regulated requirements, similar to how private insurers function in the current Medicare Advantage system. The third major difference is that Harris says she would not use taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her plan. While both Harris and Sanders have talked about using methods such as capital gains taxes, Sanders’ plan would tax households making $29,000 or more to pay for his plan, but Harris would only tax households making $100,000 or more. Harris’ new plan immediately received criticism from all sides. Sanders’ campaign has said she should not be using the “Medicare for All” framing if she wants to keep private insurance while Biden and other moderates argued Harris is still trying to have it both ways and is avoiding taking a strong position on health care. During the second debate, Biden criticized Harris’ plan as too expensive while Harris focused on her goal of achieving health care for all Americans. Before the debate: The South Bend, Indiana Mayor has said he supports “Medicare-for-all who want it.” While his preference is for a public option program, Buttigieg said in a response to the New York Times health care survey that he views Medicare-for-all as the ultimate goal. Even then, though, he sees a role for private insurance “on a supplemental basis.” After the debate: Buttigieg stuck with his “Medicare-for-all who want it” phrasing during the debate and said offering a public option would create a “very natural glide path” to a single-payer health care system. He also doubled down on his support for maintaining private insurance. “Let’s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there’s still a private sector, that’s fine,” Buttigieg said. “It’s just that for our primary care we can’t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system.” Before the debate: Like several of her Senate colleagues running for president, Gillibrand is a co-sponsor of Sanders’ Medicare-for-all plan as well as other more moderate proposals. She has often said she believes a single-payer system is the best way to ensure universal health care, but believes private insurance will naturally be driven out of the market because it will not be able to compete with Medicare-for-all. After the debate: When the debate moderators asked candidates to raise their hands if they would abolish private insurance, Gillibrand notably did not. The New York Senator explained that she supports Medicare-for-all, but as she has said in the past, she views the four years of transition in Sanders’ bill as vital to its success. “The plan that Senator Sanders and I and others support, Medicare-for-all, is how you get to single payer. But it has a buy-in transition period, which is really important. In 2005 when I ran for Congress in a two-to-one Republican district, I actually ran on Medicare-for-all and I won that two-to-one Republican district twice. And the way I formulated it was simple: Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford,” she said. “What will happen is people will choose Medicare. You will transition. We would get to Medicare-for-al. And then your step to single payer is so short,” she added. Before the debate: The Colorado Senator has proposed a public option plan known as Medicare X, which he drafted with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. It would allow people to buy into a public option program, which would expand over time, or keep their private insurance. Bennet has emphasized that polling shows many Americans are satisfied with insurance through their employer and would like the option to stick with that. After the debate: Bennet remained consistent at the second debate and clashed with Sanders as he criticized the Vermont Senator’s Medicare-for-all plan and promoted the idea of choice. “I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. I think that is what the American people want,” Bennet said, noting that most private insurance would not exist under Sanders’ plan. “I will say Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for I guess that’s where plastic surgery,” Bennet continued. “Everything else is banned under the Medicare-for-all proposal.” Before the debate: Yang favors moving to a Medicare-for-all system. Similar to Gillibrand, Yang doesn’t want to eliminate private insurance, but believes it would no long be “economically viable” once it was competing with Medicare-for-all. The entrepreneur also said that he sees a public option as a positive step in the transition toward Medicare-for-all. After the debate: Yang did not talk about health care during the debate. Before the debate: Hickenlooper supports universal health care, but he does not think Medicare-for-all is the best way to get there. While on the campaign trail, he has said he does not believe backing Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for candidate viability and has pointed out that many Americans are happy with the private insurance they have now. After the debate: Hickenlooper did not delve deeply into health care during the debate, but did stick with his view that universal health coverage can be achieved without committing to Medicare-for-all. When the moderators asked Hickenlooper about his previous comments warning the Democrats against embracing socialism, he said that he was wary of policies that would allow Republicans to call a Democratic candidate a socialist. “We can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage. I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.” Before the debate: Similar to Buttigieg, Swalwell has said he supports “Medicare-for-all who want it.” He has said he does not want to get rid of private insurance, but would use the public option to put pressure on private insurers to offer more affordable plans. “Americans should have a choice between coverage provided by private companies and that provided by the government,” he told the Times. After the debate: Swalwell did not talk much about health care during the second debate. He did weigh in on one question, saying he wanted to stand up to insurance companies and ensure people could access care, without going broke. Before the debate: Williamson had said she wants “high-quality universal health coverage for every American” and supports a public option. “Those who wish to keep their private insurance may do so,” she said on her website. After the debate: During the debate, Williamson stuck with her support for a public option, but she also dismissed the detailed plans that many of her fellow candidates were debating. “It’s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat Donald Trump by just having all of these plans, you’ve got another thing coming because he didn’t win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying make America great again,” she said.","UPDATED: JULY 31,"

Activists around the country have been flocking to the offices of their elected representatives to express their dismay at the bill, which proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and which the Congressional Budget Office said would result in an additional 22 million people losing insurance by 2026. On Monday, an estimated 100 protestors showed up at the Capitol to demonstrate at the offices of various legislators. Protesters visited the offices of Republicans like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, where they shouted chants against the bill and told personal stories of how the health care changes would affect them. The Capitol Police said they received reports of “demonstration activity” at 13 locations in the House and Senate office buildings and arrived on the scene around 2 p.m. Monday. Demonstrators who refused to stop protesting were arrested and charged with “crowding, obstructing or incommoding,” according to the police statement. PAID PARTNER CONTENT BY CHINA DAILY A total of 21 protesters were arrested in the House of Representatives office building, and 59 people were arrested in the Senate building, according to the police. As some protesters were taken away in handcuffs, videos shared on social media showed them yelling: “You are killing people! You are systematically killing people!” and “Health care is a human right!” The intense fight over the nation’s health care has sparked many who will be most affected — often chronically sick or disabled people — to protest against the Republicans’ proposed changes. In the past few weeks, police have forcibly removed disability advocates from the U.S. Capitol and from other legislative buildings in states across the country.","JULY 10, 2017"
How We Chose the 50 Most Influential People in Health Care | Time,747,"T
he American health care system has been plagued for decades by major problems, from lack of access to uncontrolled costs to worrying rates of medical errors. And yet, real as those issues remain, the field has also given rise to extraordinary innovation. This year, TIME launched the Health Care 50 to highlight the people behind those ideas: physicians, scientists, and business and political leaders whose work is transforming health care right now. To assemble our first annual list, we asked our team of health editors and reporters to nominate people who significantly changed the state of U.S. health care this year. Then we evaluated their work on key factors, including originality, impact, and quality. To see the full list, click here.","OCTOBER 18, 2018"
This Election Will Decide the Future of American Health Care | Time,9014,"I
t’s safe to say that COVID-19, the country’s worst public health crisis in a generation, was the single most important issue in the 2020 Presidential race. It warped the campaign, sickened a candidate, and shaped not only voters’ opinions, but how they cast their ballots. But amidst this unprecedented crisis, the topic of American health care—the single most important issue in the 2018 midterm race—got relatively little attention once the primary was over. The candidates rarely gave speeches about insurance premiums or co-pays, and most Americans remain unclear about what, exactly, BidenCare is, or whether Donald Trump’s long-promised “brand new, beautiful health care” even exists. In the closing days of the election, former Vice President Joe Biden tried to change that. In stump speeches across the country, he repeatedly hammered on the point that he and President Donald Trump have two divergent visions of American health care. “Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege,” he told a crowd in Michigan on Oct. 31. “Barack [Obama] and I think it’s a right.” Implicit in Biden’s stump speech was a broader truth: the future of American health care really does hang in the balance. The results of the presidential election, combined with a hugely consequential U.S. Supreme Court case challenging the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could not only shape the American health care landscape for decades, but also determine whether millions of Americans immediately lose their health care coverage. In exactly one week, the Supreme Court, which now includes Justice Amy Coney Barrett, will hear oral arguments in California v. Texas, in which a group of conservative state attorneys general, backed by the Trump Administration’s Justice Department, is seeking to invalidate the entirety of the ACA. If the Supreme Court strikes down the ACA, chaos would likely ensue: the federal funding for Medicaid expansion would evaporate, leaving more than 12 million people who rely on the program to likely lose coverage; the subsidies for those who buy insurance through the ACA’s private insurance marketplaces would also disappear, leaving the majority of those 11.4 million people without insurance; and all insurance providers would suddenly be allowed to discriminate against people who had pre-existing health conditions, including COVID-19, by charging them higher premiums or denying them coverage outright. “If no part of the political process responds to the Supreme Court holding, the results would be immediate and calamitous,” says Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor. But that outcome is hardly guaranteed. It depends on what happens next—both what the Supreme Court decides and who wins the Presidential election. Here are three possibilities. The first is that the Supreme Court upholds the ACA, leaving the fate of the law to a newly elected Congress. Another option is that Trump wins the election, a scenario that creates the most uncertainty around the future of American health care, as neither Republicans nor the Trump Administration have produced anything resembling a coherent replacement for the ACA. The third option is that Biden—and enough down-ticket Democrats—win the election and secure majorities in both the House and Senate, setting themselves up to either improve the ACA or pass a new health care law in 2021. Legal scholars from both sides of the aisle have said they don’t expect the Supreme Court justices to buy the Republicans’ argument that the ACA, stripped of its tax penalty, is unconstitutional. “The legal arguments themselves are astoundingly weak,” says Katie Keith, a health law professor at Georgetown University. “But the law is in front of the court again 10 years after it was passed. And you can’t really take anything for granted especially with the Affordable Care Act and the political nature of the litigation that we’ve seen against the law.” Chief Justice John Roberts has ruled in favor of the ACA in its past two Supreme Court cases, and he is expected to side with the liberal bloc again this time. But that means the decision may come down to how Barrett, Trump’s newest appointee, and his two previous judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh vote. The court is likely to make a decision sometime this spring, and if it does strike down all or most of Obamacare, changes would start right away. While the President has talked and tweeted about a “beautiful” or “far better” health care plan than what Democrats are offering, his policies thus far have included a series of effectively meaningless and legally unenforceable executive orders. Trump has said repeatedly, for example, that he wants to protect people with pre-existing health conditions, which is one of the most popular provisions of the ACA, but his only move on this so far has been to ask voters to trust him. In September, he announced an executive order declaring that it is “the policy of the United States” to “ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.” Such an order is legally unenforceable. Meanwhile, his Administration has spent the better part of the last four years specifically unwinding precisely those protections. The current case before the Supreme Court, which is backed by the Trump Administration, would eliminate all shields for those with pre-existing conditions. Trump has also promoted short-term health insurance plans that do not have to comply with ACA rules such as covering people with pre-existing conditions, encouraged states to limit access to Medicaid, and cut the budget for outreach and enrollment efforts to help people sign up for insurance. “This is the rhetorical problem that Republicans have gotten themselves into. Republicans wasted a decade arguing repeal and replace,” says Joel White, a Republican strategist who specializes in health policy. Republicans need to present voters with more choice and lower costs, but so far the GOP health care platform is mostly blank. Biden’s detailed health care plan centers on building on and improving the Affordable Care Act and creating a government-run public health insurance plan that anyone could choose. The idea in part is that a so-called public option would allow the federal government to negotiate and pay less to medical providers the way that private insurers do for their enrollees. And while it’s not clear how well this would work, experts say, the public option would be significant in who it covers. Biden would automatically enroll the 4.7 million adults who are eligible for Medicaid but remain uninsured because their states haven’t expanded the program, and he would allow any American who has employer-based insurance to leave their plan and join—a major step toward the long term progressive goal of eliminating private insurance. About 12 million of these people who currently get insurance through their job could find the public option to be cheaper, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Biden would also lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60, allow the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over prescription drug prices, and spend $775 billion on caregiving, which will continue to be a significant issue as COVID-19 adds to the ranks of Americans who need long-term medical care and support. “This is the biggest disability boom since AIDS and HIV in the 80s. And beyond that Polio,” says Rebecca Cokley, director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress. “The social safety net is not prepared for this.” Of course, Biden’s plans hinge on what the next Congress looks like. If Republicans retain a Senate majority, hopes for sweeping new health legislation dwindle. But even if Democrats seize both houses, Biden will need to negotiate with progressive lawmakers from his own party, who have long pushed for more comprehensive universal health care, like Medicare for All. Any new legislation would also have to survive what most experts expect would be multiple challenges from states and the insurance industry—case that would land before an even more conservative judiciary. “There are lots of states where you’re going to see intense resistance,” says Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University who has studied shifts in policy attitudes after economic crises. “That will matter because I think that it will push political leaders towards approaches that do not rely as heavily as the Affordable Care Act does on the states.” Biden’s campaign estimates that about 97% of Americans would have coverage under his new plan, which would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. “What we’re going to do is going to cost some money,” he admitted during the final presidential debate in October. But his appeal to voters was clear: with the ACA hanging in the balance, Americans are not only selecting the next President this election, they are, conceivably, choosing the future of American health care.","NOVEMBER 3, 2020"
Which Americans Are Letting Health Care Slide Due to COVID-19 ...,8505,"T
here’s more than one way to get sick during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can contract the virus, of course, as more than 28 million Americans already have. Or you can dodge the disease but still suffer from the disruption caused by quarantines and social distancing, if they lead you to neglect routine health care. That, a new TIME-Harris Poll survey shows, is just what too many of us are doing. The top-line numbers from the survey of 1,093 participants (a representative sample of the U.S. public) are sobering, with 78% of respondents reporting that they have put off at least some medical services during the past three months of pandemic. Of those procedures, dental exams or cleanings were the most frequently missed, with 30% saying that they have passed on regular oral care. Annual physical check-ups were next at 27%, followed by eye exams at 25%. More troubling—if somewhat less common—were the 15% of people who said they were missing appointments with specialists, including orthopedists, dermatologists and, most worrisome, cardiologists. The 500,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic represents a scary enough figure, but it still trails the 655,000 who lose their lives each year to cardiovascular disease. If even a fraction of heart-disease patients are missing their regular cardiology visits during the pandemic, there could be a bump in that overall mortality number down the line. A similar trend could result from people missing routine cancer screenings. “I am most concerned about an increase in morbidity and mortality due to cases of cancer being detected too late,” says Kelly Anderson, a health services researcher and PhD candidate at John Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. Demographics play a significant role in who is staying current with health care during the pandemic and who is letting things slide. In the case of education, for example, good health practices seemed to be inversely associated with academic achievement. Only 16% of people with a high school education or less have put off their routine check-ups during the pandemic, compared to 31% of people with some college and 34% of college graduates. Similarly, lower income Americans appear to be doing a better job of looking after themselves than higher-earners. Just 21% of people in households with less than $50,000 annual income are missing routine physicals, compared to 23% in the $75,000 to $100,000 group and a whopping 35% of those in households earning more than $100,000 annually. In some ways, these numbers are unsurprising. Lower-income and less-educated people tend to be more likely to have chronic health problems and thus have less of an option of skipping their physicals. “Conditions like diabetes and hypertension are more common among people with lower income. They might feel like they just know they can’t miss a check-up, so they make it more of a priority,” says Dr. Jessica Justman, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “People with higher income have more options for diet and exercise and are healthier overall.” Insurance—or lack of it—may be at work too, says Dr. David Buchholz, medical director of primary care at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. People in lower income brackets are disproportionately represented among the uninsured, and thus likelier to lack access to health care to begin with; if they haven’t been getting regular physicals all along, they’d be less likely to describe themselves as missing them now. “If they’re starting from a baseline health care of zero,” Buchholz says, “they’ll still be zero during the pandemic.” For people who do have health insurance, the type of policy is a factor as well. Among those who get their insurance through the public marketplace—where there can often be high deductibles and other out of pocket expenses—62% are saying no thanks to annual checkups compared to just 32% of people on employer-sponsored health care plans. As with so many things, race and ethnicity play a significant role as well, with communities of color suffering more—often lacking health insurance and working in lower income jobs. Among white Americans, 20% report missing their annual check-ups during the pandemic, compared to 29% of Black Americans and 48% of Hispanic Americans. Structural disadvantages that made health care harder to access pre-pandemic would only be exacerbated when lockdowns and economic hardship set in. Anderson also points out that even among low-income Medicaid recipients, there are up-front costs for health care, which may simply not be affordable in the COVID-19 economy. “Even small out of pocket costs can be a major barrier and lead to people forego care,” she says. No surprise at all in our incorrigibly partisan culture, political leanings have played a role in health care decisions in the past year. Throughout the pandemic, blue-staters and Democrats have generally been more compliant with mask-wearing and social-distancing, while red America has pushed back, as one study from the University of Chicago confirmed. But when it comes to health checkups, self-identified liberals were likelier to report letting things slide in the TIME/Harris Poll survey, with 32% saying they’ve skipped annual exams, compared to 27% of moderates and 24% of conservatives. Buchholz thinks at least some of this may have to do with the share of red-staters who believe the pandemic is either a hoax or exaggerated. If they’re continuing to go to bars and restaurants and parties, there’s no reason they wouldn’t go right ahead going in for physicals too. Liberals, by contrast, who tend to fear the pandemic more, might see doctors’ offices as dangerous congregate settings and seek to avoid them. “In red states, people are going about their business,” Buchholz says. “Liberals are hunkering down more.” Some positive findings are buried among the more concerning ones, much of them regarding telehealth, which is clearly experiencing a boom. In our recent survey, only 29% of people reported receiving some of their health care online prior to the pandemic; that figure jumped to 51% during the pandemic era. Here too, race has been a factor, with Black Americans more likely to have been early adopters of telehealth before the pandemic and white Americans only recently tumbling to it. Prior to COVID-19, 38% of Black Americans had used telehealth, a figure that has now jumped to 56%. Among white Americans the before-and-after figures have more than doubled, from 25% to 51%. The racial disparity, Buchholz believes, is one more result of systemic disparities that leave Black Americans with jobs that don’t offer insurance or that don’t allow them to leave work for a check-up. The result: they’ve long been accustomed to finding workarounds like urgent care centers or telehealth. “If we begin with the premise that Blacks have more barriers to health care,” he says, “you imagine they would have gotten smart about health care too, and telehealth is one way.” Unexpectedly, mental health services, which would seem like the kind of care that most lends itself to telehealth since it so often involves nothing more than a conversation, has lagged. Among all respondents, only 24% said they were currently receiving mental health care, down from 29% before the outbreak. Justman believes economic considerations may be one explanation for the decline. In an economy battered by the pandemic, with so many people having lost jobs and income, psychotherapy might seem to some people like a luxury. Transitioning from in-person psychotherapeutic care to telehealth may also be more difficult or uncomfortable for some people than others, Anderson suggests. It’s too early to tell how the health care landscape will change after the pandemic is at last over. Some patients and doctors who have picked up the telehealth habit, for example, may decide they quite like it and stick with it whenever possible. Others may decide they prefer the old face-to-face model. What it’s not too early to say is that a country that already suffers from too much chronic illness will be wise to return at least to its pre-pandemic levels of doctor visits when the coronavirus crisis is in the rear-view mirror. COVID-19 has taken enough lives without our allowing other preventable and treatable diseases to claim still more. Click here to download the full set of data for this survey.","FEBRUARY 23, 2021"
Artificial Intelligence and Health Care Are Made For Each Other | Time,4384,"A
rtificial intelligence has the potential to radically change health care. Imagine a not too distant future when the focus shifts away from disease to how we stay healthy. At birth, everyone would get a thorough, multifaceted baseline profile, including screening for genetic and rare diseases. Then, over their lifetimes, cost-effective, minimally invasive clinical-grade devices could accurately monitor a range of biometrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and glucose levels, in addition to environmental factors such as exposure to pathogens and toxins, and behavioral factors like sleep and activity patterns. This biometric, genetic, environmental and behavioral information could be coupled with social data and used to create AI models. These models could predict disease risk, trigger advance notification of life-threatening conditions like stroke and heart attack, and warn of potential adverse drug reactions. Health care of the future could morph as well. Intelligent bots could be integrated into the home through digital assistants or smartphones in order to triage symptoms, educate and counsel patients, and ensure they’re adhering to medication regimens. AI could also reduce physician burnout and extend the reach of doctors in underserved areas. For example, AI scribes could assist physicians with clinical note-taking, and bots could help teams of medical experts come together and discuss challenging cases. Computer vision could be used to assist radiologists with tumor detection or help dermatologists identify skin lesions, and be applied to routine screenings like eye exams. All of this is already possible with technology available today or in development. But AI alone can’t effect these changes. To support the technical transformation, we must have a social transformation including trusted, responsible, and inclusive policy and governance around AI and data; effective collaboration across industries; and comprehensive training for the public, professionals and officials. These concerns are particularly relevant for health care, which is innately complex and where missteps can have ramifications as grave as loss of life. There will also be challenges in balancing the rights of the individual with the health and safety of the population as a whole, and in figuring out how to equitably and efficiently allocate resources across geographical areas. Data is the starting point for AI. And so we need to invest in the creation and collection of data–while ensuring that the value created through the use of this data accrues to the individuals whose data it is. To protect and preserve the integrity of this data, we need trusted, responsible, inclusive legal and regulatory policies and a framework for governance. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a good example: in the E.U., GDPR went into effect in May 2018, and it is already helping ensure that the health care industry handles individuals’ information responsibly. Commercial companies cannot solve these problems alone–they need partnerships with government, academia and nonprofit entities. We need to make sure that our computer scientists, data scientists, medical professionals, legal professionals and policymakers have relevant training on the unique capabilities of AI and an understanding of the risks. This kind of education can happen through professional societies like the American Society of Human Genetics and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which have the necessary reach and infrastructure. Perhaps most important, we need diversity, because AI works only when it is inclusive. To create accurate models, we need diversity in the developers who write the algorithms, diversity in the data scientists who build the models and diversity in the underlying data itself. Which means that to be truly successful with AI, we will need to overlook the things that historically set us apart, like race, gender, age, language, culture, socioeconomic status and domain expertise. Given that history, it won’t be easy. But if we want the full potential of AI to be brought to bear on solving the urgent needs in global health care, we must make it happen.

Supreme Court Hobby Lobby Contraception Ruling: What Women ...,8628,"O
n Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the government cannot require certain employers to provide insurance coverage for birth control if they conflict with the employer’s religious beliefs. The ruling on Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. is not only a blow to the Affordable Care Act but also, critics argue, to women’s rights. Here’s what women need to know: 1. If you work at certain types of for-profit companies, they no longer have to cover the cost of any contraception that they say violates their religious beliefs The Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) requires most health insurance plans to cover birth control without cost-sharing. Without healthcare coverage, the pill can cost about $25 a month and an IUD (intrauterine device) can cost up to $900 (though it’s inserted once and lasts up to 12 years). Before the ruling, houses of worship were already exempt from the birth control insurance mandate. Non-profit organizations with religious affiliations, like Catholic colleges and hospitals, have to inform the insurer if they object to contraceptives, and the insurer is then responsible for figuring out a way to guarantee contraceptive coverage for the workers without the company using its premiums to pay for it. The privately-owned corporation Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based craft store with self-described Christian values, argued that they too should not have to cover certain emergency contraception because of their religious beliefs. The company objected to paying for emergency contraception including Plan B, Ella—both commonly known as the morning after pill—plus two types of IUDs. Hobby Lobby said they believe these types of birth control amount to abortion. The company did not object to covering other types of contraception, including birth control pills. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, but the ruling applies only to companies considered “closely held.” According to the IRS, a company is “closely held” if five or fewer people own more than half the corporation. Closely held firms make up over 90% of all American businesses, and about 52% of the American workforce works for a closely held corporation, according to studies from Columbia University and New York University. The Affordable Care Act, however, only requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance to workers, so many “closely held” firms are already exempt. Justice Samuel Alito suggested in his ruling that the Health and Human Services (HHS) department could extend the accommodations that they have in place for religious non-profits to these for-profit companies so the insurer would provide birth control without charging the company. However, both religious groups and women’s rights groups think this would be insufficient. Some religious non-profits have alleged that these accommodations still infringe on their religious beliefs and are suing the federal government. And advocates at the Women’s National Law Center have said companies should be required to provide contraception as a basic healthcare need. The Obama administration may need to come up with a an alternative way to provide coverage, but it’s unclear what those options would be or how difficult they would be for consumers to access. 2. All three female Justices dissented, arguing that this ruling limits women’s rights Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Stephen Breyer (the only male justice who dissented). “The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would…deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage,” Ginsburg wrote. “Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community,” she continued. Ginsburg notes that an IUD without coverage costs a month’s pay for minimum-wage workers. And critics of the ruling say that because a federal work around hasn’t been developed yet, many of the women who currently work for places like Hobby Lobby have lost easy access to key family planning options and the most most effective type of birth control. Even after the gap is filled, it still may be cumbersome to acquire birth control. While some women are able to choose their place of employment taking health care into consideration, because of geography and economic restrictions, that’s not possible for all women. (Read the entire opinion and dissent here.) 3. The ruling may depress use of IUDs at some privately held corporations that deem it a form of emergency contraception Health groups have begun to lobby for an increased use of IUDs. The IUD has a failure rate of less than one pregnancy per 100 women in a year, better than both the pill (9 pregnancies per 100 women per year) and condoms (18 pregnancies per 100 women per year), according to the CDC. Despite all these benefits, just 9% of women in America use it—the lowest of any developed country. (By comparison, 23% of women in France and 41% of women in China use IUDs.) It’s just starting to gain traction in America: Planned Parenthood reports a 75% increase in use since 2008. Today’s decision, which gives certain companies the option of not covering the IUD among other types of contraception, arguably undermines gains made in IUD usage. The IUD can also be used as emergency contraception if it is inserted five days after intercourse, hence the Hobby Lobby’s objection to it and not birth control pills. This isn’t the way most women use the IUD: many gynecologists will only schedule an appointment for IUD insertion until after a woman gets her period that month so as to ensure she’s not pregnant. Some will even perform an ultrasound. There are no statistics on how many women use the IUD as an emergency contraceptive method instead of alternate methods like the “morning after” pills, but James Trussell—a Princeton Professor who has done extensive research on the topic—told TIME’s Sarah Begley, “I would say that the number [of women] who get IUDs as emergency contraception is miniscule.” The fallout from today’s ruling could be that some women who work companies that refuse to cover the IUD may be discouraged from using this effective birth control method by additional costs they may incur or the complications of finding supplemental insurance. 4. Women’s rights groups are angry because they see the ruling as a loss of autonomy for women Some women’s rights advocates have taken the argument even further than Ginsburg did. Up until this point the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) has been interpreted as a protection for individuals’ religious practices—not those of corporations. The Supreme Court just said that these protections also extend to for-profit companies, but didn’t protect a woman’s right to choose her method of birth control. Thus, many critics argue, the Supreme Court decided that corporations are people, but women are not. Women’s rights groups say restricting insurance coverage for some types of contraception, or making coverage more difficult to obtain, undermines access to birth control in general and point to studies that have shown that offering greater access to contraception—rather than restricting it—leads to fewer unintended pregnancies and thus reduces the number of abortions by 75 percent annually. 5. Under the ruling, some corporations could attempt to refuse coverage for other, non-contraceptive medications and procedures citing their religious beliefs As Ginsburg writes in her dissent, “Would the exemption…extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations?” In the majority opinion written by Justice Alito, he specifies that the ruling applies only to the contraceptive mandate, and states that it should not be understood to include to other insurance mandates, like those for blood transfusions or vaccinations. But Ginsburg notes that even if the Alito exclusion holds, there are other issues: “Approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be ‘perceived as favoring one religion over another,’ the very risk the [Constitution’s] Establishment Clause was designed to preclude,” said Ginsburg.  ","JULY 1, 2014"
Healthcare: How the GOP Obamacare Repeal Hurts Children | Time,2951,"L
egislation being considered in the House that repeals key provisions of the Affordable Care Act threatens our most vulnerable citizens: disadvantaged children with serious mental health disorders. As professionals who strive every day to help children and families struggling with mental health disorders, it is shocking that we must issue this reminder. When these young people don’t get help, they are at risk for continued mental health problems, antisocial behavior, school failure, jail, drug abuse and suicide. These children are not always well-served by the system we have in place — not by a long shot. But just walking away would be the worst possible outcome. Late last year, Congress passed legislation that made us optimistic that the nation might finally address the simmering public health crisis of childhood mental health disorders. It expanded research and treatment and prevention programs. It was a bipartisan success. But it will be for nothing if we dismantle the safety net, make care harder to access and afford, and actively legislate against that progress. Professionals who know firsthand how the healthcare system affects families are appalled. Hospital associations and membership organizations like the American Medical Association have raised a clarion call about the potentially disastrous effects of eliminating expanded Medicaid coverage. A statement from the insurance lobby reminds us that “Medicaid health plans are at the forefront of providing coverage for and access to behavioral health services and treatment.” The Energy and Commerce Committee’s executive summary of the bill optimistically describes repeal of Medicaid expansion and the requirement that states provide essential health benefits as “returning flexibility to the States.” But the language of the law and the funding it makes available mean that “states will be required to make hard choices on which benefits they want to continue and on enrollment numbers,” says the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. The flexibility the bill’s authors applaud might well be the flexibility to maneuver between a rock and hard place — dropping the most vulnerable off the rolls and through the cracks to avoid bankrupting the system. The House healthcare proposal is a step backward into the “good old days” before the Great Society, when Americans could close their eyes to the realities of mental health disorders. Back then, mental illness was a silent burden or a life sentence, and we saved money by not talking about it or warehousing people in asylums. Today, we have evidence-based mental health treatments that change lives. Patients and families are pushing aside the stigma and advocating for themselves. More and more, people are being open and seeking care. We know better now. We have looked into the faces of children who meet these problems with more courage than Congress can dream of. Let’s not let them down.","MARCH 23, 2017"
Black Women Are Dying From Lack of Reproductive Care | Time,3859,"L
ike much of U.S. history, the story of Roe v. Wade – a landmark Supreme Court ruling and victory for women’s health — is complicated by who was left behind. The United States is a country built on the backs of Black women, and benefits daily from our intellectual genius, cultural influence and economic power, yet neither the promises of the founders nor the promise of reproductive autonomy enshrined in Roe v. Wade included us. Black women live in states considered hostile or extremely hostile to abortion rights. We are less likely to have health insurance, and more likely to be denied coverage for abortion when we do. Black women also often struggle to afford the birth control that best meets our needs. Yet state legislators seem intent on passing laws that make it ever more difficult for women of color to access abortion care specifically, and sexual and reproductive health care in general. Since January 2011, state politicians have enacted an astounding 401 new restrictions on abortion. These restrictions force patients to delay care, force clinics to shut down and block some people from access altogether. Black women, who already experience an unequal playing field when it comes to health care, can ill-afford the anti-abortion wave that threatens to drown access for all but the wealthy. As if that weren’t bad enough — Black women in the U.S. are dying in childbirth and from pregnancy-related complications at many times the rate of white women, a national health crisis that has gone largely ignored. The recent death of Erica Garner, just months after giving birth, is a prime example. These challenges have been with us for a long time. But there’s no question that recent measures by our government are hurting, instead of helping, the situation. President Trump has levied attacks on abortion and birth control and pushed cruel anti-family budget and tax policies. His administration has also proposed budgets that slash the funding for nutrition, housing and health care programs that Black women and families need to thrive. And Congress has failed to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program — also known as CHIP — which covers almost 9 million U.S. children. But we’re fighting back. In Alabama, the role of Black women in electing Doug Jones who supports abortion access in a race most considered impossible to win by a Democrat was finally recognized. Black women are also rising up to run for office, stage massive marches, push for proactive policy solutions and are leading the way on community organizing and integrated voter engagement. In Pennsylvania, New Voices for Reproductive Justice led advocacy efforts that contributed to the ultimate veto of Senate Bill 3 by Governor Tom Wolf, which proposed banning abortions after 20 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest. In 2017, 21 states adopted 58 new proactive measures protecting reproductive health care access and information, a sharp uptick from the 28 enacted in 2016. In Illinois, Black women leaders from the Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health and the Chicago Abortion fund played key roles in passing HB 40, which expanded Medicaid coverage for abortions and protects legal abortion in the state if Roe is overturned. For too long, Black women have been told to wait their turn. Democrats and Republicans alike have taken our votes for granted while ignoring our needs. But their time is up. We will no longer accept race and gender oppression in our politics, democracy and the overall treatment of women across this nation. It’s time for this country to put our issues – the issues of Black women – in the center of the political table and follow the leadership of Black women as we build a better future that affirms human rights of all.

India's Underpaid Women Healthcare Workers Fight COVID-19 | Time,8426,"A
rchana Ghugare’s ringtone, a Hindu devotional song, has been the background score of her life since March. By 7 a.m. on a mid-October day, the 41-year-old has already received two calls about suspected COVID-19 cases in Pavnar, her village in the Indian state of Maharashtra. As she gets ready and rushes out the door an hour later, she receives at least four more. “My family jokes that not even Prime Minister Modi gets as many calls as I do,” she says. Ghugare and nearly 1 million other Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) assigned to rural villages and small towns across India are on the front lines of the country’s fight against the coronavirus. Every day, Ghugare goes door to door in search of potential COVID-19 cases, working to get patients tested or to help them find treatment. With 8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, India has the second-highest tally in the world after the United States and its health infrastructure struggled to cope with the surge in COVID-19 patients this summer. India spends only 1.3% of its GDP on public health care, among the lowest in the world. The situation is stark in rural areas where 66% of India’s 1.3 billion people live and where health facilities are scant and medical professionals can be hard to find. India’s ASHA program is likely the world’s largest army of all-female community health workers. They are the foot soldiers of the country’s health system. Established in 2005, a key focus of the program was reducing maternal and infant deaths, so all recruits are women. They have also played an essential role in India’s efforts to eradicate polio and increase immunization, according to numerous studies. Read More: How the Pandemic Is Reshaping India But even as health authorities have leaned on ASHAs to quell the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas, where a substantial number of new cases have been reported, many of these health care workers say the government is failing them. Pay was meager to begin with, but some workers have reported not being paid for months. Their hours have increased dramatically, but pay rises, when they have come, have not reflected the increased demands. ASHAs in some parts of the country are earning as little as 3,000 rupees ($40) per month to fight the pandemic. Many have also complained about not being provided adequate protective equipment for their high-risk work. “They are the unsung heroes who are fighting to contain the unfettered spread of the virus in rural areas,” says Dr. Smisha Agarwal, Research Director at the John Hopkins Global Health Initiative. She argues it is vital to improve pay to boost morale and sustain this frontline workforce. — Ghugare was chosen from her village of 7,000 people in 2011. Since then, she has overseen countless births, meticulously monitored the health of thousands of newborn babies and strictly ensured immunization through door-to-door awareness campaigns. The personal relationships she built over the years have helped in the fight against COVID-19, giving her a good grasp of the medical histories of most of the 1,500 people assigned to her. “It’s all in here,” she says pointing to her head. Before the pandemic, she was expected to work two to three hours per day, for which she was paid about 2,000 rupees ($27) a month, with incentives for completing tasks in the community. Now, she’s spending 9 to 10 hours a day working to combat COVID-19. She had to cut back her other job working at a farm, and most of the bonuses have dried up as well. The Indian government has given her a 1,000-rupee ($13.50) COVID-19 stipend, but that doesn’t make up for the lost income. Conditions like these are pushing many of these women to breaking point. Some 600,000 ASHAs went on strike in August to demand better pay and recognition as permanent government employees. (They are currently classified as volunteers, which renders them ineligible for minimum wages and other benefits.) “The extra work we used to do earlier to ensure our stomachs weren’t empty has stopped now,” Ghugare says.   Read More: India’s Biggest Slum Successfully Contained COVID-19. But Can Its Residents Survive the Economic Collapse? Heading out the door, she puts on a face mask and headscarf to protect herself while mentally running through the symptoms of one of the possible COVID-19 patients she had been phoned about earlier. Knowing that the individual suffers from diabetes, which makes people more vulnerable to coronavirus, Ghugare begins working out how to prioritize the case and arrange transportation to a center, about 40 minutes away, for urgent testing. Some cases are particularly challenging. There are days when villagers refuse to talk to her. Worried about being forced to go to the hospital and missing work—a major hardship when people depend on daily wages for a hand-to-mouth existence—people often hide symptoms. Then there is also the menace of fake news, often spread on WhatsApp. Ghugare arrives at a house in the sweltering heat, where it takes her almost 20 minutes to persuade a man to get his wife tested for COVID-19. Because of a false rumor spread via messaging apps, he is convinced his wife’s kidneys will be removed if she goes to hospital. In the end, he relents. “Dealing with fake WhatsApp forwards is one of the most exhausting parts of the job,” Ghugare says. By around 1:30 p.m., she has already worked six hours. Before the pandemic, she would have wrapped up and headed to her second job. But now she still has a long list to get through to meet her daily target of visiting 50 houses. — Demands like these have driven many ASHAs to protest. “We are warriors who were sent to war without any weapons,” says Sunita Rani, an ASHA from the northern state of Haryana. She has been protesting against the state government since July and says she won’t give up until their demands are met. “If we can fight a virus, we definitely know how to fight our governments.” The Indian government hasn’t yet responded to their demands for permanent government employment. Most health experts seem to agree that ASHAs are underpaid. But making their roles full-time is more complicated. “The beauty of this role is the mix of incentives that tend to energize ASHAs to perform better,” says Dr. Jyoti Joshi, the director of South Asia at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policies, a public health research organization. She says retaining the incentives for completing tasks might be one solution. Pay varies by state, and salaries can range from 2,000 rupees ($27) to 10,000 rupees ($135) per month, according to a national union for ASHAs. Many workers also depend on receiving bonuses. For instance, Ghugare receives 100 rupees ($1.25) if she vaccinates a child against measles, mumps and rubella and 600 rupees ($8) for delivering a baby for a family living below the poverty line. Some economists argue that making nearly a million female health care workers full-time employees, and paying them more, will not only benefit India’s health system but might also help revive the country’s battered economy, one of the worst hit by the pandemic. “Employing and putting wages into the hands of so many people will definitely be beneficial to the rural economy, ” says Dipa Sinha, an economist at the Ambedkar University in New Delhi. It might also help recover India’s plummeting rate of female workplace participation, for which the country is among the bottom 10 in the world. Experts have attributed this to cultural attitudes and the slowdown in the agricultural sector, where most rural women work. Sinha says that this gender disparity plays into the issue of ASHAs not being recognized for their work. “Who volunteers for six to eight hours a day?” she says. “It’s because they are women that their work is undermined. You can’t do this to a cadre of men.” Ghugare shares that sentiment although she didn’t take part in the protests. With her two children growing older, expenses are increasing. An increased salary with benefits would help her give her family a better life. As she walks back home at dusk, she knows her day isn’t done yet. There is household work to get to before getting started with a report on the day’s survey. It will be midnight before she calls it a day. That is, if the phone doesn’t ring again. “It feels like there is a sword over our heads,” she says. “A hanging sword.” —Additional reporting by Avantika Mohan","UPDATED: NOVEMBER 1,"
Health Care Vote Gives Liberals a Boost for Midterms | Time,5157,"A
s House Republicans gathered in the Rose Garden to celebrate their narrow passage of the American Health Care Act on Thursday afternoon, liberal operatives and grassroots organizers were already busy planning how to punish them for it in 2018. Democrats believe that the GOP’s vote to gut Obamacare will become a powerful issue in the midterm elections. The prospect of forcing House Republicans to defend an unpopular bill that could raise insurance costs and throw millions off their health plans has turbocharged an already energized party, boosting everything from fundraising and recruitment efforts to voter registration drives. “You will have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned her Republican colleagues. “You will glow in the dark.” Swing Left, a new grassroots organization devoted to taking back the House, raised $150,000 in the first hour after the vote, and at least $800,000 since Wednesday afternoon. Add in the cash raised by liberal networks like Daily Kos and ActBlue, and progressive groups eyeing the 2018 midterms hauled in at least $2 million in a matter of hours to help Democrats take on Republican incumbents. The fundraising haul will come in handy, because the number of seats up for grabs may be bigger than either side expected even a few weeks ago. In the wake of the vote, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shifted its ratings in 20 districts, downgrading six districts rated “solidly Republican” to “likely” GOP seats. That group included the district represented by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), who co-wrote the compromise amendment that helped pass the bill. Eleven districts once rated “likely Republican” were downgraded to “lean” GOP, while three districts shifted from “lean Republican” to the “toss-up” column. Flipping enough red districts to retake the House remains an uphill battle for Democrats, especially since gerrymandering efforts engineered by the right have reduced the number of competitive seats. But the new ratings reflect the growing possibility that the health care vote could help Democrats put the House in play, just as it did for Republicans after Democrats passed controversial health care legislation in 2010. “Not only did dozens of Republicans in marginal districts just hitch their names to an unpopular piece of legislation, Democrats just received another valuable candidate recruitment tool,” wrote the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman. The Swing Left funds are earmarked to aid Democratic candidates in 35 swing districts represented by GOP representatives who voted for the AHCA. In many cases, the money is being raised for candidates who haven’t even announced yet. Swing Left says it will stay out of primaries, but as soon as those Democratic nominees emerge, they’ll get cash to attack Republican incumbents. “In previous election cycles we might have had the luxury of saying ‘hm, let’s wait and see who supports our issues,’ but I think people really understand that it’s life and death,” says Ethan Todras-Whitehill, co-founder and executive director of Swing Left. “We can’t afford to be choosy here.” Progressive organizations say the health care vote energized supporters. Run For Something, an organization started after the 2016 election to encourage young people to run for office, usually gets around 20 sign-ups per day, but got three times that many after the AHCA was passed. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has launched a slew of ads on Facebook and Instagram targeting 30 Republicans who voted for the bill. Local groups are doubling down on their efforts: an Indivisible group in Rep. John Faso (R-NY)’s Hudson Valley district has already assembled 500 volunteers for a voter registration drive this weekend, according to organizers. Leanna Brand, a professional singer and leader of Indivisible Simi Valley, says Rep. Steve Knight (R-CA) told his constituents that he wouldn’t vote for anything that would affect the ACA’s pre-existing conditions clause, or for any bill without letting his constituents see it. Brand says Knight broke both of those promises. So she and her group are intensifying their efforts. They’ve written letters to the editor in every local newspaper, they’re registering new voters at local high schools, and even considering buying a billboard to “call him out as the liar that he is.” “He lied to his constituents twice,” says Brand, “and we’re going to use it against him.” Knight’s district is among those The Cook Political Report reclassified from “lean Republican” to “tossup.” Brand is so energized that she’s considering running against him herself. In another California swing district, protesters have gathered outside Republican Darrell Issa’s office every Tuesday since President Trump’s inauguration. Those demonstrations, which usually draw 300 to 700 people, according to Lisa Margolin-Feher, leader of a local Indivisible group, were supposed to stop after the first 100 days. Now activists plan to continue to gather indefinitely. “We will never, ever forget this vote,” says Margolin-Feher. “There is more energy now than ever.”","MAY 5, 2017"
Mark Sanford: Republicans Faltered on Healthcare Debate | Time,4038,"S
ince Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have stalled, we have a chance to carefully consider what went wrong and what might come next. Allow me a few suggestions. One, give this debate the time it deserves. I’m not a wine drinker, but they say great bottles of wine need aging, and healthcare represents a most precious bottle for Americans. In fact, third world despots dictate, while in America we legislate. The back-and-forth built into hearings and legislative cajoling allows an idea to “bake,” as it’s transformed into law. This was skipped with the American Health Care Act debate, which was given just 17 legislative days before the intended vote last Friday. In contrast, the debate surrounding Medicare Part D saw 166 legislative days. The ACA saw 187 legislative days… and was still dubbed as “rushed” by Republicans at the time. Two, remember that people don’t care how much you know as long as they know how much you care. I believe my party faltered here in this debate. Avoiding the people you represent seems hardly the formula for signaling empathy or a desire to learn. I had seven town hall meetings over the time of this debate, and while some were a bit rowdy, I learned a lot. Most importantly, I saw how it’s vital we get this right. Washington has treated healthcare in partisan terms. Democrats passed the ACA on a party line vote; Republicans were going to return the favor. It’s time for something different. Three, it’s equally important that we keep the debate on healthcare — on healthcare. We shouldn’t rush a bill because it helps with the next one or to simply check the healthcare box. (This bill happened to have a 1 trillion dollar “pay for” that would be most helpful in the upcoming tax debate.) Nor should we rush it because it’s seen as a momentum builder for the new administration. Implications on Republicans’ ability to govern is not an advocacy point that sells on healthcare, and people have an innate sense on intentions. In crafting a bill and what comes next, I believe that there are many key tenets — and they happen to be found in a bill that Senator Rand Paul and I have offered. Here are a few: One, we have to make affordable insurance legal again. The ACA prohibited this. Things like essential health benefits and community ratings found in Title I represented central wiring in its construction. They were well-intended but fatal flaws because they drove up the cost of insurance for most in the individual insurance marketplace. They prevented insurance from being insurance. If you were required to buy a $1.5 million policy for your $200,000 home, would you buy the policy? In the case of healthcare, millions of young people said no, and this proved to be the fatal mathematical flaw in the ACA. Good insurance is insurance that works for you. Let people buy what works for them. Two, our healthcare needs will stretch well beyond a job; as such, it should be portable. Who would have thought a historical event would become a driver in today’s health insurance market? Yet that’s the case. In an effort to circumvent the wage and price controls of World War II, health insurance and employment were coupled. This is not so with the other things we insure, and along with keeping people with a boss they don’t like, it brings with it many marketplace distortions. Three, recognize the ways in which our bodies are simply temporary homes for our soul. They wear out and some of what they need is routine maintenance. In other cases we renovate from a flood or a fire. Health savings accounts allow us to save for the routine. You wouldn’t buy insurance to replace filters in your home, but you would buy it to cover for a fire. The healthcare debate has changed because of the ACA; there is already consensus in maintaining coverage for preexisting conditions or staying on a parent’s plan. But it’s now time for another change so people have more choice, the marketplace is included, plans are sustainable, and insurance can once again be insurance.","MARCH 28, 2017"
What Justice Ginsburg's Death Means for Health Care Access in ...,7629,"I
n the midst of a pandemic and with the fate of the Affordable Care Act pending before the Supreme Court, attention should focus on what Justice Ginsburg’s replacement by someone who is likely to be very conservative will mean for health care. Justice Ginsburg was a strong voice and a consistent vote to provide the federal government the power to ensure health insurance for all and especially to protect women’s reproductive health. The Supreme Court first assessed the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), a few months before the 2012 presidential election. One aspect of the ACA that was challenged was the so-called “individual mandate,” requiring individuals to purchase health insurance or pay a special tax. The requirement was designed to prevent a downward spiral on the health insurance market if only sick people were enrolled (thus raising the costs associated with providing care for the enrolled group) and if healthy people had an incentive to stay uninsured until they needed care. Insurance markets only work when there is a mix of people who do and do not need the benefit at any one time. Over the objections of four conservative justices, the Court upheld the individual mandate in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, on the grounds that it was a valid exercise of Congress’ taxing power. But Roberts joined with the other conservatives to make it clear that Congress could not have imposed these regulatory requirements by relying on the parts of the Constitution that have justified most federal regulation over the past eighty years. Justice Ginsburg’s opinion challenged this limited view of federal power. “The provision of health care is today a concern of national dimension,” she wrote, “just as the provision of old-age and survivors’ benefits was in the 1930s.” To say now that Congress has no power to create a scheme to increase access to healthcare “makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive,” harkening back to an era before the New Deal “in which the Court routinely thwarted Congress’ efforts to regulate the national economy.” What she highlighted was the rise among today’s conservative justices of a view of national power that questions the very legitimacy of most New Deal and Great Society policymaking. She reminded us that “In the early 20th century, this Court regularly struck down economic regulation enacted by the people’s representatives in both the States and the Federal Government,” including minimum wage laws and anti-child labor laws, and pointed out that the vision of federal power outlined by the five conservatives bore “a disquieting resemblance to those long-overruled decisions.” Conservative activists and judges have continued their assault on the ACA. After Congressional Republicans repealed the ACA’s tax penalty in December 2017 a coalition of Republican state attorneys general went into federal court and argued that the repeal should make the entire ACA unconstitutional because the Court in Sebelius upheld the law only on the basis of Congress’ taxing power. The law’s defenders argue that by repealing only one part of the law Congress intended that the remaining elements still be in force, and that federal courts should not require a complete repeal when Congress only acted to change one piece. In fact, in December 2017, Congress rejected President Trump’s request to repeal the entire ACA. This is what is at issue in California v. Texas, which the Supreme Court will take up one week after election day. Justices Thomas and Alito made their view clear in Sebelius about Congress’s lack of power to pass the ACA, and it is safe to assume that Justices Gorsuch and Kavanagh share the same hostility to federal power. If, as now appears probable, another conservative justice joins the Court before November, then it is very likely that more than 20 million Americans will lose health coverage immediately during a national health crisis, another 12 million could lose Medicaid coverage, a whopping 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions could be disqualified from buying a health insurance policy or cause them to pay significantly higher premiums, and 165 million Americans would no longer be protected by caps on expensive treatments. If this happens it would be on the basis of a long-ago discredited, but recently revived, theory of limited congressional power, which Justice Ginsburg singled out for criticism. But this is not the only way in which the next justice will impact Americans’ access to healthcare. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores (2014) the Court’s conservatives, for the first time in American history, held that the religious beliefs of a business’s owner allowed that business to refuse to provide employees with a benefit required by law. The ACA required employers to provide health-insurance coverage that would include coverage for contraceptives for women. The ACA carved out an exemption for religious not-for-profit organizations (such as a Catholic diocese), but not for purely secular businesses. Nevertheless, the majority found that a religious person who owned a business should not be required to provide employee benefits that violated the business owner’s religious believes. Justice Ginsburg’s dissent exposed the extraordinary implications of such an accommodation. “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” She asks what is to be done about “employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with genatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian Scientists, among others)?” In a political system that relies so extensively on employer-based health insurance, the Hobby Lobby case leaves millions of Americans vulnerable to restrictions on health care that their employers do not agree with. The Trump administration has gone even further and said that all employers who have a religious or conscience objection to contraception may refuse to provide such coverage to women employees. In June, in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, the Court held that this was consistent with the Affordable Care Act. Justice Ginsburg wrote a powerful dissent, that was joined by Justice Sotomayor, stressing the importance of contraceptives for women’s health and for their equal participation in the workforce and society. “In accommodating claims of religious freedom,” she wrote, “this Court has taken a balanced approach, one that does not allow the religious beliefs of some to overwhelm the rights and interests of others who do not share those beliefs.” She lamented: “This Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer’s insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets. The Constitution’s Free Exercise Clause, all agree, does not call for that imbalanced result.” As a woman born in the depression, who saw the ravages of illegal abortion before Roe v. Wade, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a powerful voice on the Court, even in dissent, for health care. It is frightening to think what a justice from the opposite end of the political spectrum will mean for health care, and especially women’s health, in the United States.","SEPTEMBER 24, 2020"
Why More Health Workers are Getting COVID-19 in Spain: Doctor ...,4945,"Spain has the world’s highest reported rate of COVID-19 infection for doctors and nurses. 15,000 health workers are now sick or self-isolating, making up 14% of confirmed cases in the country, according to the health ministry. In Italy the figure is below 10%. No other country has reported a double-digit percentage of cases affecting doctors. Spanish doctors and nurses say they lack protective equipment they need to treat patients safely in crowded hospitals. The government’s emergency health chief admitted last week that the shortage may have fuelled a high rate of infection among medical professionals. In recent days, labor unions representing health workers have filed a series of lawsuits against the government across Spain’s regions and in the Supreme Court, in an attempt to force improvements to authorities to improve provisions. Meanwhile, doctors have shared images of colleagues using disposable raincoats, garbage bags, and other improvised materials to protect themselves from the virus. Sara, 42, is an emergency room doctor in Madrid—the epicenter of Spain’s outbreak, where one union says that over a fifth of COVID-19 cases are health workers. Sara asked TIME to only use her first name because she feared professional repercussions for speaking candidly. She believes poor coordination by authorities and a slowness to take drastic measures against the virus have put those on the front line at risk. Sara spoke to TIME over the phone from her home in Madrid on March 31. It feels like we’re being played for fools. As the COVID-19 pandemic has advanced, and the number of cases has gone up, and the cases have gotten more severe, authorities are somehow telling us we need a lower level of protection. A month ago, it was compulsory to wear impermeable overalls and a high quality mask even for lower risk tasks. Not anymore. If you’re not getting close to a patient and you’re not doing certain tasks, they say you just need a surgical mask and normal overalls. Now we reuse overalls again and again when normally we’d change every time we go on a break or see a new patient. It greatly increases the risk that you’ll get infected. I don’t think about it when I’m treating patients. But the falling standards make me feel unsafe. I worry about infecting my husband and my kids. We’re doing what we can: colleagues are improvising ways to make masks and suits. A few days ago my hospital got a donation of protective trousers from a company. Volunteer groups have been giving us 3-D printed plastic sheets as protective screens for faces. We can disinfect them and use them several times before they break. But still, many of us are getting sick. I have colleagues who are in the ICU, with serious cases of COVID-19. Right now I’m isolating myself at home because I have a slight fever. I’ve tested negative, but since I’ve been exposed I can’t go back to the hospital until my fever comes down. Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here. A doctor’s job is to look after patients. The role of managers is to manage. I know it must be really difficult for authorities to ensure we have resources at the moment. But it’s their job. There should be a better way to do it. Other countries have been able to do it better. When you see images of health workers in China—though perhaps these are the ones they want us to see—they have full protective suits and they wear two separate layers. We only wear one layer, when we have it. There has been a lack of coordination in Spain. Individuals are managing to get hold of resources. Celebrities have been donating them to hospitals. Why can’t the government get those things in the first place? The fact those in charge have been slow to act has also led to more doctors getting sick. Because it’s an illness that expands gradually, governments have taken decisions gradually. And it’s too little too late. We should have been acting like a bomb had fallen. When the first few cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Spain, they said they were all imported from Italy and China. We were seeing an unusual number of respiratory infections and they weren’t letting us test them. They didn’t let us use a mask and a protective suit for the patients we suspected of having the virus, because Madrid wasn’t yet considered an area of community transmission. Those restrictions led to more doctors getting sick. In Spain, we’ve never had to work like this before. Maybe in other countries where there aren’t many doctors or much equipment, doctors will be used to that. But in Spain we’re not used to working like that and we’re not trained to do it either. It’s really hard. Doctors in the U.S. should prepare for a war. In terms of the number of protective suits you’ll have, the number of hospital beds, the number of ventilators in the ICU—it’s like being a war medic. Try to prepare for that.

Health Care Industry Needs to be Honest About Medical Errors | Time,5290,"T
wenty years ago this fall, the Institute of Medicine—an U.S.-based independent, nongovernmental organization widely regarded as an authority at the intersection of medicine and society—released a report titled “To Err Is Human.” It announced that up to 98,000 Americans were dying each year from medical errors. Official and popular reaction was swift. Congress mandated the monitoring of progress in efforts to prevent patient harm, and the health care industry set grand goals, such as reducing medical errors by 50% within five years. News outlets reported on the proceedings closely. A remedy for a longstanding problem seemed in sight. Yet, in 2019, medical errors are about as prevalent as in 1999. “To Err Is Human” was an uneasy read; so is a September 2019 report on patient safety from the World Health Organization. Among WHO’s findings: Globally, hospital-acquired infections afflict about 10% of hospitalized patients. Medical errors harm some 40% of patients in primary and outpatient care. Diagnostic and medication errors hurt millions, and cost billions of dollars every year. So, two decades on, why this chronic state of risk in health care? The chain reaction to the 1999 report spent its energy quickly. Contrary to the report’s calls for expertise from outside the medical profession, patient safety was taken over by clinician managers and other health care administrators whose interests would hardly have been served by a thorough consideration of the crisis that would have rattled the status quo. These institutional leaders also brushed off experts (psychologists, sociologists, and organizational behaviorists, among others) who have long offered innovative ideas for improving safety and reducing health care mishaps. The medical managers had ideas, too, but those amounted to localized—and weak—prescriptions like safety checklists, hand-sanitizing stations, posters promoting “a culture of safety,” and programs inviting low-level staff members to speak up and speak their minds to their supervisors. Absent were innovations aimed at bigger classes of hazards beyond the scope of even large, multi-hospital systems such as resolving problems like look-alike, sound-alike drugs, or of confusing and error-inducing interfaces in technology. Look-alike sound-alike drugs are medications that have spelling similarities or are visually similar in physical appearance or packaging. For example, mixups in the medications “epinephrine” and “ephedrine” have led to much patient harm. The drug names look similar and are sometimes stored close to each other. But each drug has a different purpose and can have serious adverse and even deadly effects if administered incorrectly. Error-inducing technology interfaces occur when simple technology connecting devices fit multiple tubes, outlets, or machines, increasing the possibility of misconnections. For example, when a feeding tube is mistakenly coupled with a tube that enters a vein, or an IV tube is inadvertently connected to the nasal oxygen. Patient safety can be tricky to define, because it’s essentially a non-event. When things are going well, no one wonders why. When a mistake occurs and threatens the unrealistic “getting-to-zero” goal of many health care managers, then it becomes an event that demands a reaction. And the reaction generally is to assign blame to people further down the organizational ladder. It’s far easier, after all, for the industry to fault individual workers on the front lines of medical care than to scrutinize inherent organization and system flaws, or to finger highly paid specialist doctors. In the current approach to patient safety, the focus—on who did wrong and how they did wrong—is misplaced. Instead, it should be on what’s going right and what lessons can be learned from those successes. This is how health care organizations and the industry as a whole avoid dealing with the troubling task of identifying root causes of the patient-safety problem. Meanwhile, the public is assured there is little to fear (and little need for external intervention), because, after all, health care professionals are on the job. But clinician leaders and hospital administrators in charge of the industry need to realize that health care, including its patient safety component, is too big and too complex to be steered by medical professionals only. We live in an era of multifaceted problems that call for multidisciplinary approaches. Advances in anesthesia safety, for example, would not have come without the input of engineers. Experts with perspectives from outside of medicine should be welcomed to any serious discussion of how to improve patient safety, and their insights heeded. Let the words of human-factors engineering pioneer John Senders help guide a truly reformed patient safety movement: “Human error in medicine, and the adverse events that may follow, are problems of psychology and engineering, not of medicine.” An important social movement seemed to emerge in the wake of “To Err Is Human,” but it has lost its way. By being bolder and more comprehensive in its goal setting, and by embracing the acumen of experts from outside the medical profession, the health care industry could make patient safety the great social movement it deserves to be.","NOVEMBER 5, 2019"
Story Behind Photos of Counter-Protesting Healthcare Workers | Time,3490,"A
s small groups of demonstrators gathered in cities nationwide to protest the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns, one set of images in particular have been widely shared online. Taken by Colorado-based photographer Alyson McClaran in Denver on April 19, they show what she believes to be healthcare workers blocking the path of the demonstrators, who want the state and country reopened despite public health officials’ warnings that doing so would invite more cases and more death. TIME reached out to McClaran to learn more about the photographs and her experience at the Denver protest. Her answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity. TIME: How did your day start out, were you on assignment? McClaran: Because of the coronavirus, I hadn’t picked up my camera in over a month, which is unheard of for me. I’m typically shooting five to six days a week. Yesterday I decided to go out and document the protest. I wasn’t on assignment for anyone. What precautions did you take? I started out at the state Capitol in downtown Denver. It was very crowded. I had my mask on and did my best to social distance from people, but didn’t feel safe, so I decided to leave and walk around the neighborhood. I saw two nurses in the middle of the street. I took off running towards them and started firing away my camera, because they were blocking the road at a green light and everyone was screaming and honking at them, and those are the images that you see. I was at the right place at the right time. One thing I remember is the lady in the truck was yelling at the health worker to “go back to China.” How do you weigh the risk of covering a gathering in a time like this? My gut was telling me this is history, and I wanted to document what is happening in my city right now and show what was going on. I had tears in my eyes half the day because I was in shock at how many people were out, and how much anger there was, so I had to protect myself by leaving. I didn’t feel safe health-wise, and that’s when I stumbled upon the nurses. Are we sure the people in your photographs are health care workers, or could they have been counter-protesters dressed as healthcare workers? I don’t have any information on that unfortunately, but I never got the feeling that they weren’t. I believe they were health care workers. What’s it like for your work to spread far and wide online, often without credit? What do you want people to know before sharing your work online without credit? I appreciate how many people have given me photo credit. For those who have not, what happened yesterday took years of experience and I have worked my way to this moment, I was able to get everything I needed quickly, it wasn’t just me grabbing a camera and shooting. It would be nice as a photographer and artist that people acknowledge that. How was this different from other protests you’ve covered? I understand people are stressed, and they want to get back to work, but it just showed how much anger there was. Unlike other protests I’d covered, like gun violence, Black Lives Matter, this is a global issue. Everywhere is experiencing this right now at the same time, that’s why it felt different. Is there anything you’d like to add? I hope that everyone can come together. I understand that people are stressed and scared and sad and angry. But I just hope we can all come together and get through this so we can get back to normal. Alyson McClaran is a freelance photojournalist based in Denver, CO.","APRIL 20, 2020"
India COVID-19 Wave: Healthcare Workers Say Gov Failed Them ...,8644,"L
akshmi Kuril woke up feeling unwell on April 27. A community healthcare worker in India’s western state of Maharashtra, Kuril, 35, had a pre-existing heart condition and the increased work and stress of fighting the COVID-19 surge that is ravaging India meant she often felt exhausted and lightheaded. But she didn’t let it stop her. “She wanted to be a doctor,” her husband Dinesh Kuril, tells TIME, but she grew up poor and “this was the closest she could get to that dream.” After attending a meeting of fellow health workers, she felt worse and returned home—busying herself with housework and cooking dinner for her husband, her 15-year-old daughter and her 12-year-old son. As she stood to clear the dishes, she collapsed. Dinesh rushed her to a nearby hospital, but was refused admission, possibly because there was no room due to a surge in COVID-19 patients—though Dinesh says the doctors “barely threw a glance” at Lakshmi. Unwilling to accept that Lakshmi was beyond help, Dinesh took her to another hospital 5 miles away. Doctors there said she arrived too late for them to save her. “I was so angry, helpless,” Dinesh says. “My wife sacrificed her life working for a government that did not care about her as a human being.” She was tested for COVID-19 after her death, though the results haven’t yet come through. Read More: 1 Million Women Healthcare Workers Have Been Drafted to Fight COVID-19 in India—For as Little as $40 a Month As a new wave of infections rips through India, many community health workers feel abandoned by a government that they say has consistently put their lives at risk with little protective equipment, little pay (sometimes just $30 a month) and little recognition. Lakshmi was an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), part of a 1 million-strong force of female health workers who serve as a connection between smaller, mostly rural communities and India’s overloaded public health system. Experts warn the Indian government’s failure to support ASHA workers in the midst of a COVID-19 spike that is claiming thousands of lives a day is a public health risk of its own. “We need people to be tested, to be home-quarantining, and to be educated about where to seek healthcare. If we don’t have these individuals who are vital to that process, it creates another layer of insecurity,” says Dr. Amita Gupta, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Clinical Global Health Education. “We need to improve their livelihoods, because they function as a critical frontline workforce.” Since last year, ASHAs—who have traditionally worked with maternal and child health in their communities—have been the first defense against COVID-19 for many communities. During the first wave, they were instrumental in testing, tracing and arranging treatment for people with COVID-19. Lakshmi’s death in Wardha, a district 400 miles northeast of Mumbai, has been a wakeup call for many of her fellow ASHA workers, who have long felt overlooked and unheard. “They say we are frontline workers, that we should be celebrated. But when we are sick they refuse us admission and leave us to die,” says Archana Ghugare, a friend of Lakshmi who is an ASHA in a nearby village. “It feels terrible to be treated this way—like we don’t matter, our lives don’t matter.” Read More: India’s COVID-19 Crisis Is Spiraling Out of Control. It Didn’t Have to Be This Way TIME first followed Ghugare in October last year as she rushed around her village helping to administer COVID-19 tests, dispel misinformation and educate her community about public health. Her voice catches when she thinks about her friend Lakshmi. “This is too close to our own lives—it could have been any of us.” As of last September, 18 ASHAs had died fighting COVID-19, according to the government. In this latest, devastating surge, there are no definitive estimates on the number of ASHAs that have been infected by COVID-19, says Gupta. But the risks are clear. “ASHAs have been extremely vital to vaccinating and quarantining in rural areas,” Gupta says. “Having them come down with COVID infection leaves really major gaps in being able to respond effectively in rural areas.” Even before her friend’s death, Ghugare knew first hand her work was dangerous. When Ghugare had asked her superiors for a mask at the start of India’s second wave, she was told she wouldn’t need one because she had received her first dose of vaccine. During the first major COVID-19 wave, the government gave ASHAs two masks per month, but “this time, nothing.” Ghugare received the first dose of India’s homegrown vaccine, Covaxin, on Feb. 22. She delayed receiving the second dose of vaccine because she said she didn’t have the time or energy to walk the 5 miles to the clinic. “I could have taken an auto rickshaw but that’s too expensive at 50 rupees [$0.69],” she says. “We don’t get paid so much to afford an auto ride to the vaccination center.” The average salary of an ASHA is $30 to 40 a month, but it can be higher depending on incentives offered by different state governments. On April 17, she tested positive for COVID-19. Initially, she was not scared, but as the COVID-19 cases skyrocketed across the country and she witnessed people pleading for hospital beds and oxygen and saw news reports of bodies piling up in crematoriums, she began to feel uneasy. And then Lakshmi Kuril died. “I am now petrified,” she says. Ghugare’s own case of COVID-19 turned out to be mild. But even on leave from her job for 21 days, quarantined at home, she still makes sure to call her patients every day to advise them. “I feel responsible for them,” she says. “I need to stay with them through this ordeal.” Read More: The Survivor’s Guilt of Watching India’s COVID-19 Catastrophe Unfold From Afar ASHA workers want the government to supply them with masks and protective equipment that other medical workers who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients receive. A survey by Oxfam India, reported by the Indian media last September—showed that only 75% of ASHA workers were given masks and only 62% were given gloves. ASHA workers interviewed by TIME say they have even less access to masks, gloves and sanitizer now than during the first COVID-19 wave last year. Also troubling to many ASHAs is that a government life insurance scheme for health workers expired in March—meaning they are fighting the pandemic without assurances that their families will be supported if they die. The health ministry, in a tweet on April 18, had said it was working to finalize a different insurance plan for the health workers. Despite the risks, ASHA workers say their only option is to continue to work because their communities are in such dire need. And like experts, many warn that official COVID-19 counts—which have peaked at more than 400,000 cases a day—don’t come close to telling the true story. “There was not a single case in my village last time,” says Kanchan Pandey, an ASHA from a village in the northeastern state of Uttar Pradesh. “But this time there are already 5-6 active cases and as people keep coming from cities and there are no quarantine centers, the cases will rise even more.” In Ghugare’s village there are officially just 200 cases. But if testing was ramped up “the number of cases will be much higher,” she says. In low-income areas in cities, newer hotspots are emerging. “Every second home is affected this time,” says Usha Thakur, an ASHA from Najafgarh, a city outside New Delhi. “There are four to five people affected in the same house. But the lists are being updated with only one name from one house. “ She adds: “Last time, we were under tremendous pressure to test, test, test. This time not so much.” And the pressure on ASHAs, who are the only health resource in many of the communities they serve is immense. “My phone rings through days and nights,” Thakur says. “I have been overwhelmed. And sometimes I do not know how to handle it…. All I know is that I will try to save as many lives as I can with my limited resources.” Lakshmi Kuril’s husband blames this stress for his wife’s death. Despite having been diagnosed with a congenital heart condition,“she worked day and night—walked in the heat to different centers as and when assigned,” Dinesh says. He says Lakshmi would come back home tired and exhausted and grumble that her job was going to be the death of her. “And look what happened?” he says, breaking down into tears. “Today it’s my wife, tomorrow it will be another ASHA. This is not right—someone needs to intervene. Someone needs to stop this injustice.” With reporting by Billy Perrigo / London","MAY 4, 2021"
Obamacare: Transgender Discrimination Banned | Time,2126,"T
he Obama administration has finalized a new rule that bans discrimination against transgender people and all discrimination on the basis of sex within health programs that receive federal funding. The Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday the finalization of the Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities rule, a part of the Affordable Care Act’s Section 1557. The rule forbids health care providers who take funding from the HHS from denying health care based on gender identity or denying patients treatment for sex-specific ailments like ovarian or prostate cancer simply because an individual identifies as a different sex. “A central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care. Today’s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this Administration’s commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve,” said Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia M. Burwell in a statement. A 2010 national survey found that 19% of trans men and women were refused services because of their gender identity, 28% said they had been harassed in medical settings, and half said they had to teach their health care provider about caring for transgender people. Though the rule will not eliminate all discrimination, it will make it easier for those who feel they have been wronged to file complaints and take legal action. The new rule, which also clarifies protections for people with disabilities and non English speakers, comes as Obama administration has taken several steps to protect transgender individuals this week. On Friday, the administration wrote a guidance letter to U.S. public schools directing them to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Friday called the letter “advice” to school administrators. “What the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangible, real world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the country,” Earnest said.","MAY 13, 2016"
Mitch McConnell: Disability Protesters Removed From Office | Time,1629,"U.S. Capitol Police forcibly removed demonstrators and disability advocates — some of whom were in wheelchairs — protesting the Senate’s proposed health care bill outside of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office Thursday. Capitol Police said they arrested 43 protesters for refusing to end the demonstration. Organized by ADAPT, a disability rights organization, the protest targeted the bill’s significant cuts to Medicaid for low-income Americans. “No cuts to Medicaid, save our liberties,” the protesters chanted. One protester who was in a wheelchair held a sign reading “life and liberty 4 disabled Americans.” “Our lives and liberty shouldn’t be stolen to give a tax break to the wealthy,” Bruce Darling, an ADAPT organizer at the protest, said in a statement. “That’s truly un-American.” Earlier Thursday, McConnell and other Senate Republicans unveiled the once-closely guarded draft of the Senate health care bill aimed at dismantling former President Barack Obama’s health care law. In addition to cuts to Medicaid, the bill proposes defunding Planned Parenthood and scales back tax credits for middle-income Americans who purchase their own health insurance. Democrats have fought back against the bill, and four Republican senators said Thursday that they are not ready to vote on the bill yet. Republicans would likely need 50 of their 52 senators to vote in support of the bill for it to pass. The version of the bill passed by the House last month would cause 23 million Americans to lose coverage by 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is expected to score the Senate bill by next week.","UPDATED: JUNE 22,"
After Hobby Lobby: A Single-Payer Health Care Solution? | Time,3733,"N
ow that the initial shouting and—at times—vitriol from both sides has subsided after Monday’s Supreme Court ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, it’s time to take a sober look at what the ruling says about the future of health care reform in the United States. The majority’s ruling was an imperfect solution to a complicated case involving the reach of religious liberty to exempt organizations from providing certain medical benefits that they find morally objectionable to their employees. The fact that these medical benefits were almost exclusively offered to women makes this decision all the more difficult to accept for some. But at its core, the case reveals something else as well. It brings to the forefront something we’ve all known for sometime: that Obamacare—for all the good it’s done in increasing access to quality and affordable healthcare—is a messy law. It asks employees to be at the whim of its employers’ objectives and mission for what health care benefits they receive. It also asks employers to at times reject its deepest convictions in order to provide certain benefits to its employees. This isn’t sustainable. A person’s access to quality healthcare shouldn’t depend on who their boss is. And an employer shouldn’t be heavily fined if they don’t compromise their religious convictions in providing healthcare for their staff. President Obama’s Affordable Care Act is a monumental first step in achieving a just and equitable American health care system that seeks first to serve those on the margins of society. But as we look towards the future, it’s necessary to consider major alterations or even alternatives to Obamacare to continue to advance healthcare reform. For those of us who value both universal access to quality healthcare and the strong American tradition of protecting religious liberty, there might be a solution in a single-payer system. A single-payer system overturns an unsound principle of Obamacare: relying too heavily on private organizations to deliver the public good of healthcare. When you require private organizations to enforce what the government believes ought to be public policy, you open yourself to a myriad of legal and ethical qualms. How can you expect organizations as diverse as Hobby Lobby, the Little Sisters of the Poor and the American Atheists to agree on what health care benefits are appropriate for their employees? Amidst all the fuss this week over the Supreme Court ruling, both sides actually agreed on one thing: they disliked the accommodation provided by the Obama Administration for religious organizations. Religious groups argue the exemption is too narrow and doesn’t protect the autonomy of some organizations to practice their convictions. Women’s groups argue that the current accommodation unfairly denies women working for religious groups access to birth control, which is a basic benefit in any healthcare plan. A single-payer public health care option eliminates such complications. No matter who your boss is or what business you work for, you get access to the healthcare you need. And employers will not be forced to compromise their religious beliefs while providing the public good of healthcare. And let’s be clear, if you have something that is both supported by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Planned Parenthood, you might be onto a plan that proves the angel Gabriel right: nothing is impossible with God. Fred Rotondaro is the chair of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Christopher Hale is a senior fellow at Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. He helped lead national Catholic outreach for President Obama’s re-election campaign.","JULY 3, 2014"
Donald Trump's Health Care Executive Orders Lack Teeth | Time,5709,"P
resident Donald Trump, who has long promised a “beautiful” and “phenomenal” health care plan, announced a series of largely meaningless actions on Thursday during a speech in North Carolina that effectively served as a campaign event. The most tangible proposal Trump unveiled was a vow to send $200 prescription drug discount cards to 33 million Medicare beneficiaries “in the coming weeks.” However, the President said the $6.6 billion outlay needed to fund this program would have to come from savings from his “most favored nations” drug pricing proposal, which he announced on Sept. 13, and which experts say would be close to impossible to implement before the November election. The Trump Administration recently tried and failed to convince the pharmaceutical industry to fund a similar plan, according to the New York Times. It’s unclear if the version announced Thursday will see a different fate. Trump also announced two non-binding executive orders on Thursday, one addressing the topic of surprise out-of-network medical bills and the other addressing the topic of protecting pre-existing conditions. These are two of Americans’ biggest complaints with the country’s health care system. But neither of these orders will have any immediate effect on the problem at hand. The first non-binding executive order is simply a promise. It declares that “it is the policy of the United States that people who suffer from pre-existing conditions will be protected,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on a press call with reporters before Trump’s speech. This does not create a policy or a law. Administration officials and the President himself said this would cover the same protections already established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—the health care law passed by former President Barack Obama, which the Trump Administration is currently trying to overturn in court. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to the ACA on Nov. 10, one week after Election Day. If the High Court overturns the law, the American health care system would be sent into chaos. (That prospect is now more likely since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died and Trump has vowed to appoint a new judge to replace her as soon as possible.) The protections for those with pre-existing conditions that Trump is touting would evaporate, tens of millions of Americans would lose health insurance coverage and the current system of insurance marketplaces would disappear. Health care and legal experts noted that it’s unlikely the White House could put in place similar protections for people with pre-existing conditions without passing a law through Congress. Trump, though, did not seem deterred. He told the often-cheering audience on Thursday that he was glad his Administration has been able to keep the ACA’s protections for pre-existing conditions even as Republicans successfully eliminated other provisions, like the so-called individual mandate. “We were able to terminate the individual mandate, but kept the provision protecting patients with pre-existing conditions,” Trump said. This statement likely made the Trump Administration’s own Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers squirm. In the current ACA case before the Supreme Court, DOJ lawyers are backing an argument that is at odds with the President’s words—that the Justices must find the entire ACA no longer constitutional since the individual mandate is no longer in effect. And while Trump has often talked about protecting people with pre-existing conditions, his Administration has repeatedly taken actions that would have the opposite effect. The Administration has supported Congressional Republicans’ many attempts to repeal the ACA, which would eliminate protections for those with pre-existing conditions, and it championed cheaper, skimpier health insurance plans that allow insurers to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. The second non-binding executive order also does not commit Trump to taking action. Rather, it directs Azar to work with Congress to ban surprise out-of-network medical bills. If Congress does not pass legislation by Jan. 1, Azar told reporters, then Trump will direct him to take other actions. (Azar said he did not have other details on what those actions would be.) Trump’s announcements Thursday failed to match his pledge of a “full and complete” health care plan. They also failed to make good on senior officials’ claims, made on the press call just ahead of Trump’s speech Thursday, that the President would present an “historic” proposal. But none of this came as much of a surprise to those in Washington or in the health care industry. Trump’s speech, less than six weeks before an election in which he’s trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in most polls, was widely viewed as another attempt to change the national conversation. Trump is particularly lagging behind Biden on most health care issues, and surveys show that most Americans still disapprove of the President’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. A new survey released by the Commonwealth Fund on Thursday found that the majority of likely voters in 10 battleground states said Biden is more likely to protect insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions. And a poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation this month found that the majority of voters trust Biden over Trump on a variety of health care issues, with the President only leading narrowly on prescription drug prices. Trump’s top advisers, while striking an upbeat note before his event in North Carolina, demurred when asked for the details on how the President’s new plans would become reality. “It is what it is,” Azar said.","SEPTEMBER 24, 2020"
An Inside Look at Apple's Biggest Step Yet in Health Care | Time,17885,"C
aptain America and Black Panther were about to defend Earth from the villain Thanos when Kevin Foley first noticed something was wrong. Foley, a 46-year-old information-technology worker from Kyle, Texas, was heading into the theater to see Avengers: Infinity War when he realized he was having trouble breathing normally. The sensation struck again during another movie the following night, but more severe this time. Once the credits on the second film rolled, Foley took action: he looked at his wristwatch. It was a bigger step than you might imagine, because Foley was wearing an Apple Watch equipped with medical sensors and experimental software to track basic functions of his heart. And the watch was worried. It had, according to the display, detected signs of an irregular heartbeat. Before long, Foley was in an emergency room, where doctors hooked him up to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which showed that he was in atrial fibrillation, or AFib, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke and other potentially fatal complications. Foley spent the next few days in the hospital while doctors worked to return him to a normal sinus heart rhythm–eventually turning to a procedure called electrical cardioversion to shock his heart back to normalcy. Foley is doing fine now. But he believes that, if not for the warning on his watch, he might not have sought help in time. “I would have never known,” he says. Foley and his watch were part of an experiment run by Apple and Stanford’s medical school. But beginning Dec. 6, anyone can get an on-the-fly heart checkup, assuming they’ve shelled out $399 or more for an Apple Watch. That’s when Apple will roll out a software update that turns its latest model, called the Series 4, into a personal ECG, thanks to an innovative new sensor. Though less sophisticated than hospital ECG machines–which typically require sticking 10 different electrodes to the patient’s body–the watch version can nonetheless provide basic information and warnings of potential anomalies worthy of a closer look by a medical professional. For Apple, this new ECG-on-your-wrist is its biggest bet yet that personal technology will inevitably encompass personal health. Along with competitors, Apple gadgets have already offered fitness functions, such as apps to track the steps you’ve walked. But with the new ECG scan, Apple is moving squarely into medical aspects of health, a distinction underscored by the fact it sought–and received–Food and Drug Administration clearance for the cardiac monitor. Indeed, CEO Tim Cook isn’t modest about the company’s ambitions. “Apple’s largest contribution to mankind will be in improving people’s health and well-being,” he told TIME in a recent interview. That may sound like a lot of pressure for a watch that can tell you the time in Mickey Mouse’s voice, but Apple isn’t alone. Having disrupted work, shopping, entertainment and our social interactions, Silicon Valley increasingly wants to play doctor too. From Google, which has a secretive division devoted to no less a puzzle than lengthening the human life span, to startups like AliveCor, which makes its own tiny ECG heart monitor to connect to smartphones, companies large and small are looking for ways to scan, analyze and track your bodily functions. Venture capitalists invested a record $10.8 billion last year in startups working in health-related fields like biotech and genetics, according to deal-tracking site PitchBook. If successful, tech companies will usher in a new era in which your vital signs are constantly monitored, you and your doctor have access to a trove of data and your phone or watch can alert you of potential danger. Scientists are devising ways to address mental health too. But for every benefit, there are new risks as well. From privacy-shredding data breaches to overhyped developments like the now-disgraced Theranos blood tests, Silicon Valley has a distinct deficit of trust with consumers these days. Even if everything works much as advertised, are patients and doctors ready? Some experts already fear a surge of watch-wearers flooding emergency rooms and physicians over the slightest blip–potentially prompting costly and unnecessary tests (and no small measure of anxiety). Either way, this is happening now, and in a big way, thanks to Apple’s already enormous customer base. “We have tens of millions of watches on people’s wrists, and we have hundreds of millions of phones in people’s pockets,” says Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams, who oversees the company’s health projects. “There’s a huge opportunity to empower people with more information about their health. So this is something we view as not only an opportunity, but a responsibility of ours.” This holiday season, if you aren’t obsessively checking your cardiac function, you’ll probably know someone who is. The first clear evidence of Apple’s health fixation arrived in 2014, just three years after the death of its visionary co-founder Steve Jobs from complications related to pancreatic cancer. A new app appeared on the iPhone called, simply, Health. It was in some ways a virtual medical file, a place for users to store data on everything from body weight to blood pressure to the results of various tests. The idea was to give people a central spot to collect sensitive health information, one that would make it easy to share with medical professionals while at the same time keeping it secure with Apple’s data-encryption technology. Some information could be typed in by the user, while other data could flow directly into Health from compatible devices and apps. Wi-fi scales and Bluetooth blood-pressure monitors, for instance, could automatically update your record. A year later, Apple moved more directly into measuring your body’s functions when it launched the first Apple Watch. The back of the device included green LEDs and light sensors that press against the wearer’s wrist. The watch could calculate pulse by flashing the LEDs hundreds of times a second and measuring how much green light was absorbed by the blood. Apple wanted to market the Watch as a fitness companion, and Williams, the COO, says the sensor was born out of a need to more accurately track the number of calories a user burned in a day. In 2017 the company partnered with Stanford to launch the experiment that helped Kevin Foley find out about his AFib. It was called the Apple Heart Study. Researchers wanted to see if the Apple Watch could be useful for identifying irregular heart rhythms. It involved more than 400,000 volunteers, all wearing an Apple Watch that periodically checked for abnormalities. If anything out of the ordinary was detected, the user was put in touch with a doctor and, in some cases, sent a traditional ECG device, which was then used to assess the accuracy of the watch. As Foley learned, the technology worked. But even as subjects in the Stanford study were getting a window into their cardiac health, Apple was engineering a closer look still at the heart. The company’s Series 4 watch, which went on sale Sept. 21, looked much like its predecessors–but it actually includes a new set of sensors capable of measuring electrical activity in the body. An ECG is, in effect, simply a way of measuring electrical signals, but it can reveal much more about what’s going on in the heart than pulse alone. The watch can perform an ECG thanks to two electrodes, one on the back of the device where it makes contact with a user’s wrist, and the other on the side. Once the updated software rolls out to activate the feature, users will be able to open a new ECG app and place a finger on the watch’s crown. About 30 seconds later, users can view a readout of the heart rhythm on their iPhone, and they will be alerted to potential abnormalities. A traditional hospital ECG is often referred to as a “12-lead” machine, because its 10 different electrodes provide information on 12 different areas of the heart. (See “The Beat Goes On” for more.) The Apple Watch ECG, lacking all those wires stuck to different parts of your body, is similar to what’s considered a single-lead device. Yet research suggests that even that pared-down approach can provide a surprisingly useful picture of the heart. While final data from the Stanford study hasn’t yet been published, Apple says the Series 4’s accuracy levels are over 98% when compared with a 12-lead ECG. “The FDA has been very rigorous, and they should be,” says Williams. To be clear, no one is suggesting that a watch can substitute for a doctor. Any anomalous readings from the ECG can be transmitted to the user’s physician, along with a note detailing any physical symptoms users may have been feeling that spurred them to take an ECG reading in the first place. The new Apple Watch can also be set up to periodically scan for potential abnormalities in the background, and alert users when something may be amiss, prompting them to take an ECG. (Two other caveats: it’s not meant for people under the age of 22 or those previously diagnosed with AFib.) Even as it was devising new sensors and software, Apple was also beefing up its health expertise. In a move that didn’t attract much attention among tech journalists but that made a splash in the medical-tech world, Apple hired Dr. Sumbul Desai from Stanford’s medical school to serve as its vice president of health. Desai, 46, is considered an expert at the intersection of medicine and health. After earning a degree in computer science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, she worked at IBM and then ABC and Disney. She went back to school for a medical degree and completed her residency at Stanford, eventually joining the university and later becoming vice chair of strategy and innovation for the department of medicine. She continues to serve as a clinical associate professor of medicine there in addition to her Apple responsibilities, a signal of the level of cooperation between the organizations. Desai says she believes the type of continuous monitoring possible with personal technology will be a medical game changer. “When I’m seeing patients, it’s often just the snapshot that I get when you’re in clinic with me, but what goes on in your everyday life is a big black box,” she says. Gadgets and apps will allow patients to give their doctors “a more complete picture.” The engineers of Silicon Valley have a long history with health technology–but of the corporate, rather than the personal, variety. Indeed, Hewlett-Packard, the origin of the startup-in-a-garage mythos, grew to have a robust business in medical instrumentation for hospitals and doctors’ offices. But the rise of the smartphone has all but guaranteed a move to get personal with your health. Practically all people are now walking around with a powerful computer in their pocket, one that’s capable of serving as the hub for other gadgets, like watches and sensors. More to the point, though, given how capable most phones are now, makers need to find new ways to distinguish their products beyond bigger screens and slightly-better-than-last-year’s cameras. Health care may be the right prescription. Global health care spending is estimated to reach $8.7 trillion annually by 2020. Apple in particular needs a way to make up for what analysts forecast to be sagging iPhone sales. (The smartphone accounted for about 60% of Apple’s $62.9 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter.) If health-tracking features can keep current customers loyal to iPhones and Apple Watches and help attract new buyers, they will provide a lifeline to this critical part of Apple’s business. But pretty much everyone wants in on this. Google parent Alphabet backs a head-spinning range of health initiatives, from artificial intelligence to detect signs of illness when fed a patient’s health data; to Calico, a subsidiary devoted to understanding human aging with an eye to longer life spans. Facebook, meanwhile, has reportedly considered a data-sharing program with hospitals. The startup 23andMe has turned DNA testing into a consumer product; pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline recently acquired a $300 million stake in the company. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley’s aspirations have been marred by missteps–most notably in the case of Theranos, founded in 2003 and valued at approximately $10 billion by 2015. Theranos and its charismatic CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, promised to revolutionize medical testing by dramatically reducing the amount of blood required to get usable results, cutting costs in the process. The company couldn’t deliver, and Holmes was indicted earlier this year on federal charges including wire fraud. In the long run, however, it’s privacy concerns that have the biggest potential to hamper tech companies’ health dreams. News of data breaches that expose consumers’ personal information have become practically routine. Some 23andMe customers have already expressed outrage over the GlaxoSmithKline deal, which in part gives the pharma giant access to 23andMe users’ anonymized data for drug targeting. Facebook’s hospital data-sharing idea was shelved after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which convinced many everyday social-media users to reconsider what data they’re sharing and with whom they’re sharing it. Yet some of the most powerful advances in health could come from taking the data from all of these individual users and mining it for new discoveries. “I’m hopeful and optimistic that if we collect lots of data, put it all together and crunch our way through it, we’ll find out useful and interesting things, be able to improve health and all these really good things,” says Nicholson Price, assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School. “The negative side of that of course is what it always is, which is that Big Data is great for selling people stuff.” In that respect, Apple may have an advantage. The company has sought to build a privacy-friendly image, and compared with most of its competitors, Apple focuses more on selling hardware, music and movies than on monetizing its customers’ data. And it took a public–and controversial–stand when it objected to helping the FBI unlock an iPhone used by a gunman in a December 2015 San Bernardino, Calif., shooting. Apple COO Williams says all health data collected by the Apple Watch is encrypted both on the device itself and if users choose to back it up, making it harder for hackers to reach. Some cardiologists and other experts have raised concerns that the Apple Watch’s ECG feature is unnecessary for the general population or could cause problems, including false positives. At best, they say, that could result in stress for users and unnecessary visits to doctors, helping further burden an increasingly sluggish health care system. Worse, false positives could also lead to unnecessary follow-up tests, with the costs and health risks those can involve. “If everybody with an Apple Watch and an alert from an Apple Watch went to a heart-rhythm doctor that was super comfortable with this, then I think it would be O.K.,” says Dr. John Mandrola, a cardiac electrophysiologist practicing in Louisville, Ky. “But there are going to be millions of people going to the doctor that in many cases will be just fine.” Apple responds that no medical test is 100% accurate, so some false positives are inevitable. But it has taken steps to reduce them: the Apple Watch will only alert users to a potential problem if it detects five instances of what it considers a cardiovascular episode. What worries Mandrola and others, though, is the sheer scale of what’s about to unfold–a consequence of the ubiquity of Apple’s products. Come Dec. 6, every single Apple Watch Series 4 owner will suddenly have access to this on-demand ECG readout. The company doesn’t break out watch-sales figures, but one highly regarded analyst estimates it will sell about 9 million of the latest model by year’s end. And even doctors skeptical of the device may have to heed its warnings, lest they expose themselves to liability issues. While Apple’s setup process offers a quick briefing explaining what an ECG shows, it will largely be up to users’ physicians, cardiologists and other medical professionals to respond to concerns–and to use the data as they see fit, if at all. Apple says it has worked closely with medical experts to deliver that information in a way that’s familiar and useful rather than foreign and overwhelming. “There was a lot of thought put into the user interface to make sure someone understands what to do with the information, so that it’s actionable but not anxiety-provoking,” says Desai. As to the future beyond ECG readouts, Apple executives would not comment on coming features. A recently filed patent hints at a noninvasive glucose monitor, but patents don’t always become products. Meanwhile, though, other companies are busy developing and selling add-on devices, from a blood-pressure monitor to a sleep-aiding headband. But one other big opportunity looms: mental health. Though harder to quantify than ECG and blood-pressure readings, doctors learn more all the time about how mental health affects a person’s overall well-being. And as technology companies are increasingly criticized for their role, whether real or perceived, in damaging our mental health, there’s pressure to find solutions. To that end, Apple has launched several features, including Screen Time, an iPhone app that keeps tabs on the amount of time a user spends on their device, and Breathe, an Apple Watch app that guides users through a brief deep breathing exercise. “From a physician and medical standpoint, your mental health is what drives a lot of your physical health too,” says Desai. “We like to focus on the full person.” This appears in the December 17, 2018 issue of TIME.","DECEMBER 6, 2018"
Why Kate Ryder Founded the Women's Healthcare App Maven | Time,5060,"In The Boss, women share how they became successful and the lessons they learned along the way. Everyone needs healthcare. Yet, to the surprise of many people I speak with, both healthcare providers and the consumers interacting with the healthcare system are overwhelmingly female. Approximately 80% of healthcare decisions are made by women, who commonly guide care not just for themselves, but also for their children and families. Likewise, the majority of healthcare jobs — including doctors, nurses and technicians — are held by women. Given this, it’s worth a double-take that the system is run almost entirely by men. Only about a fifth of healthcare executives are women. I’m part of a small percentage of women who run digital health startups. My company, Maven, a digital clinic for women, bridges gaps in healthcare by providing on-demand access to a network of over 1,000 women’s and family health providers. Patients can see Maven Practitioners either by video, by text or in-person. We have served over 100,000 patients since we launched a few years ago, and I’ve seen firsthand how gender imbalance in healthcare boardrooms negatively affects care for women — and also what we can do to change things. When I started Maven in 2014, the inspiration was all around me: I was working in venture capital in London covering the emerging digital health sector. It was around the same time that my friends started having kids and I noticed the gaps in care that exist at every life stage, but appear to get bigger when women start a family. Why, for example, aren’t there easier ways for women to navigate fertility problems, get postpartum care or access birth control? Why is seeing a good doctor so difficult and inconvenient that getting a prescription for something like a urinary tract infection requires putting your entire life (and your family’s life) on hold? How is it even possible that the United States has the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world? I remember one particularly shocking story: A woman suffered a miscarriage at seven months and was forced to deliver her stillborn baby. After the procedure, she was then placed in the postpartum section of the hospital alongside several new mothers and their babies. That experience sent her into a crippling depression, and she was unable to get support due to the lack of robust mental health coverage by her insurance company. This gap in care had wide-ranging repercussions for her at work and at home. This clearly was not a “user experience” designed by a woman. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I knew I could do better. So I quit my job in early 2014, rallied a small but mighty team who shared my urgency for changing the status quo, and started building a product and a network of providers from scratch. We launched Maven to the consumer market about a year later. I’m proud of many things that my team and I built in the short time since launching Maven. Two of them stand out. First, it was a no-brainer to build a network with a wide range of specializations to cater to the specific needs of our users. A “typical” new mom might work with an OB-GYN, Pediatrician, Lactation Consultant, Women’s Mental Health Provider and Women’s Health Physical Therapist all in the same week. All of those providers are represented in Maven’s network, work together digitally and provide referrals to one another. And 98% percent of the practitioners in our network are women. Second, Maven’s family benefits platform for companies helps pregnant employees and soon-to-be parents with fertility, pregnancy, postpartum and return-to-work issues. Working families get unlimited access to the Maven network, as well as a maternity or fertility concierge to help them navigate everything from disability benefits to childcare options to egg freezing discounts. The draw for companies? They get better retention of valuable employees and a reduction of costs in one of the most expensive areas of care. Raising money for this business came with its challenges. It’s no secret that the venture capital industry is dominated by men. In our early fundraising rounds, it was challenging to get male investors excited about something that many of them couldn’t personally relate to. But Maven has now raised over $15 million in three years. At times it was frustrating, but I feel fortunate that things are now moving so quickly — especially since there’s still so much work to do. As a country, we have a long way to go to improve women’s access to quality healthcare, but I’m more optimistic than ever that we’ll get there. The future of women’s health is inextricably linked to the future of healthcare. And the future of healthcare is moving in a direction that favors value-based care and consumer choice. Women, as the core consumers and purveyors of healthcare, must be central to this process. By listening to the many unmet healthcare needs of Maven’s patients and other women, and by responding through product innovation, we can bring a sorely-needed focus to women’s health.","APRIL 18, 2018"
Rare Diseases Show the Bad Economics of U.S. Health Care | Time,6433,"I
f you ever end up in an emergency room, the first thing that happens is a doctor or nurse will check your “critical” vitals: your temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse. If those indicate your life is at risk, your care is prioritized over others who have already been waiting or who have been seen by a doctor but require additional testing (e.g. an x-ray or blood test) or a specialist to review their symptoms. This process, called “triaging,” is the global standard for allocating resources in emergency care. Triaging is a marvel of modern healthcare if it is abundantly clear that you are on death’s door. But if there’s no textbook description of your condition, it can leave you needlessly suffering while the experts try to figure it out. That’s often the case for those with rare diseases, a group of conditions that are not individually common, but combined, affect an estimated 10% of the global population, some 475 million people. An estimated 80% of the 7,000 identified rare diseases are caused by DNA mutations that occur during pregnancy, meaning most of those with this category of illness are born with it. In many cases, these babies emerge from the womb with life-threatening conditions that doctors—working the triage system—will immediately address. However, this also tends to lead doctors to then ignore the underlying rare disease—an “unnecessary medical expenditure,” in the triage system framework. I am one of the people living with a rare disease. I was born with a number of symptoms and signs that put my life at risk a collapsed lung, a premature exit from my mother’s body after only six months, and malnutrition from a hole in my amniotic sac. These problems were all treated and resolved over a multiple month stay in the hospital dictated by the triage system. I was allocated hospital resources for my life-threatening conditions until I was deemed stable enough to go home: the point at which I wouldn’t die if I left the care of the hospital. But there was another problem that was overlooked, and which wasn’t diagnosed until I was five years old. Every bone in my body was bent and every muscle atrophied or non-existent. I couldn’t move my neck away from shoulder; I couldn’t straighten my legs, knees, arms, wrists, ankles, toes, hands, or fingers beyond fixed, fully bent positions. The triage system worked at saving my life, but never addressed how I would live day to day or even physically move from a single location by myself. It never addressed the underlying issue and root of the problem: a rare orthopedic genetic disease. The “life or death” triage standard is one of the primary reasons that it takes, on average, seven years for people with a rare disease to get a diagnosis in the U.S.—and I am one of the lucky ones. Serendipitously, a Because of these surgeries, and additional ones I’ve had since, I could feed myself, live free from a wheelchair, go to school through the post-graduate level, and hold a full-time job. The orthopedic surgeries I needed—over 29 of them in less than 30 years—have cost millions of dollars. And these costs grow each year as I undergo additional exploratory surgery in the absence of any cure. However, these costs are still lower than what I would have incurred had I been left as the triage system deemed “stable” as an infant. I would have required 24-hour in-home care my entire life. I would never have been able to use the bathroom alone, to get dressed alone or to even leave the house alone. The lifetime value of a working individual according to the US Office of Management and Budget is on average $7 million to $9 million. The cost of a full-time caregiver is on average $40,320 a year; if a rare-disease patient reaches the average US life expectancy of 78 years old, the lifetime cost of full-time care is at least $3 million. Our healthcare system needs to weigh the long-term costs of leaving behind people with rare disease, and, more specifically, evaluate the economic consequences that follow at a global scale. Even more so, we need to weigh the costs of creating a pipeline to fill the treatment gap facing people with rare disease., Using genomic sequencing, clinicians can holistically understand the genetic roots of rare disease and even potentially cure rare disease through gene therapy, which modifies and permanently ‘fixes’ abnormal genes that cause a specific rare disease at birth. Nonetheless, identifying the root genetic cause of rare disease is the only way to begin to cure a rare disease rather than just treating the symptoms in an ad hoc fashion. While certain pharmaceutical drugs can be developed from the findings in a genomic sequence to help mitigate or lessen symptoms, the science suggests the only way to cure a rare disease is to administer an even newer science called gene therapy—which modifies and permanently ‘fixes’ genes that are abnormal. Considered to be the most expensive option, a However, this nascent science is costly: gene therapy costs around $2 million for current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved options. Insurance plans in the US rarely pay for clinical-grade whole-genomic sequencing (which can carry a price tag of up to $9,000)—let alone gene therapies. Yet if the most expensive cost to cure a rare disease is $2 million, that’s still far less than $3 million for a lifetime of full-time care (which excludes additional expenses). And new studies, like one the World Economic Forum released in the lead up to this year’s International Rare Disease Day, show that we can ultimately save money in the long term by funding more treatments and, as an added benefit, potentially develop more cures by learning when treatments work and when treatments don’t work. We can’t create clinical pathways for the more than 7,000 rare diseases overnight, but we need a standard of care that goes beyond using death as the primary barometer of focus, over-simplifies the complexity of what it means to be “healthy,” and only considers short term costs. An economically effective, new model could center on allocating resources with the end goal to allow people to reach a level of health that provides basic mobility or basic independence—a level of health allowing economic productivity. We are living in a time of unprecedented medical innovation, and our system of coverage needs to catch up. We can do better than just keeping people alive.","FEBRUARY 29, 2020"
Disability Advocates Removed From Senate Protest Health Bill | Time,3127,"S
tephanie Woodward, a disability advocate who was forcibly removed from the U.S. Capitol while protesting the controversial Senate health care bill on Thursday, said it was worth it because “the lives of millions of people with disabilities are on the line.” “I genuinely believe that thousands, if not millions, more people in our nation now know about the crisis that people with disabilities are facing with these cuts,” said Woodward, director of advocacy at the Center for Disability Rights in Rochester, N.Y. “And if being arrested and carried out is what needed to happen in order to get people to pay attention to this issue and get angry about it and start calling their Senators, then it was completely worth it.” Woodward, who has spina bifida, got out of her wheelchair to participate in a “die-in” organized by the disability rights organization ADAPT outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office. Protesters chanted against the bill’s significant proposed cuts to Medicaid — which could affect the community services available to people with disabilities. Woodward, who was arrested along with several dozen other protesters, said officers who broke up the demonstration initially put her back in her wheelchair, but they struggled to wheel her out and ultimately carried her out instead. “They at first were reluctant to touch me because they had seen I was wearing leg braces, so I think they thought I was extra fragile, so they waited to carry me out last from the office,” said Woodward, 29, who was charged with incommoding, or obstructing. “And I was not actively being aggressive or resisting, but I certainly wasn’t going to help them in the process. I acted more like a sandbag that just kind of flopped.” Dawn Russell, who was born with cerebral palsy, also participated in Thursday’s protest. She said one of the most concerning parts of the current health care debate is a lack of public understanding about how the proposed legislation could affect nearly every part of disabled people’s lives. “We have a perception of people with disabilities in this country, and we have a mindset that somehow our lives aren’t valued. And I can promise you, with the home and community-based services that I receive, I would dare put my life up against anybody without a disability,” said Russell, 51. “Without those services — without the home and community-based services — I am just what people think about me, as a person with a disability. But with these services, I live a life. I live independently, interdependently, in the community just like everybody else. These services allow me to do that.” She said had it not been for Medicaid, she would have entered a nursing home when her husband died in 2015. Instead, she receives daily attendant care in her home, helping her to get ready for work in the morning and go to bed at night. “We have the right to live,” Woodward said. “And by live, I don’t mean just breathe. I mean be a part of the American dream, be in the community, raise a family, go to work. These Medicaid cuts will force people into institutions who don’t need to be there.”","JUNE 23, 2017"
Watch Stephen Colbert Compare Healthcare & 'Game of Thrones ...,1326,"I
n honor of the introduction of Republicans’ replacement healthcare plan this week, Stephen Colbert took to Wednesday night’s Late Show to break down the bill and the political response. “Welcome to day three of healthcare plan two: repeal and revenge,” he opened. “It took the GOP forever to release this thing. They are like the George R.R. Martins of healthcare,” he joked; the Game of Thrones author is a notoriously slow writer, with readers waiting for six years now for his latest book. “And just like in Game of Thrones, a lot of your favorite characters are going to die without warning,” he added dryly. He went on to talk about the proposed plan’s detractors “on all sides,” including within the GOP itself. Colbert warned that Republicans could suffer a consequence all too familiar to the citizens of war-stricken Westeros. “Which would be terrible because their healthcare plan does not cover ‘bloodbath,'” Colbert quipped. He also mentioned the opposition of AARP. “You fools! You’ve awakened the ancient ones! For months now, the elders have slumbered after sending one of their own to lead us,” he intoned dramatically. “But now they stir, roused by a threat to the healthcare they so cherish… Don’t you know, they’re the ones who vote?” Watch his dark takedown, above.

"Voters Care Most About Economy, Healthcare and Terrorism | Time",1200,"R
epublicans and Democrats disagree sharply over what issues matter most heading into the final stretch of the 2014 midterm elections, but among all issues the economy dominates as the preeminent concern. About 83% of Americans ranked the economy as their chief concern, followed by healthcare (77%) and terrorism (75%). That’s a drop in importance of the economy from 90% in 2010. Healthcare and terrorism have essentially held steady since then. Republicans are more concerned about the economy and terrorism than Democrats. For Republicans, foreign policy, the budget deficit and immigration loom largest among issues to consider in the upcoming election, each being named “very important” by at least 70% of polled voters. In contrast, Democrats are more interested in the environment and economic inequality by a similarly wide margins.

Health Care Bill: Four Ways It Hurts Women's Health | Time,6337,"S
enate Republicans revealed new legislation—a much-anticipated follow-up to the American Health Care Act passed by the House of Representatives last month—intended to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The Senate’s version of the bill, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, keeps much of the framework of the ACHA, with a few changes. But many health care experts and medical groups are voicing concern with the Senate’s version of the bill—especially with its potential impact on low-income Americans, people with pre-existing conditions and specifically women. “This legislation deliberately strips the landmark women’s health gains made by the Affordable Care Act and would severely limit access to care,” said Dr. Haywood Brown, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), in a statement. “If enacted, this legislation will turn back the clock on women’s health.” Many top health groups said they tried to offer their input on the bill but were turned down. Haywood, too, said ACOG tried many times, but their “women’s health expertise was rejected,” as the legislation was crafted behind closed doors. Now, Haywood urges the Senate to “reject this bill and begin anew.” Other health experts that TIME spoke with agree. Here are four ways they say the bill, as it stands now, would affect women and families across the country. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans sold on the individual market must cover “essential health benefits,” often at no cost to the patient. These include many women-focused services like maternity coverage, contraception, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, well-woman visits, breast pumps and domestic violence screening and counseling. Large employer plans aren’t required to include these benefits, but if they do (and almost all do), they must provide the same level of coverage without annual or lifetime limits. But the House bill would allow individual states to decide which essential health benefits would be covered for their residents and at what level. While the language in the Senate bill isn’t quite the same, it appears to offer a similar loophole, says Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and management at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. “It’s certainly possible you could have health insurance being sold in a state that does not provide maternity coverage or really limits prescription drug coverage,” says Ku—a scenario that could apply to employer-sponsored plans as well as private insurers. “It’s too early to predict exactly how that will play out and what the government will allow for, but it’s a possibility that would not really be permitted under the existing system.” Like the House Bill, the Senate’s new legislation calls for cuts in federal funding to Medicaid expansion, which many states have used in recent years to reduce their numbers of uninsured residents. It also places caps on the amount of money each state can receive for Medicaid and uses a funding formula that would leave the program even more underfunded than under the House bill. (Currently, Medicaid is funded based on how many people are enrolled and what their health-care costs are.) Medicaid covers more women than men, and it also covers half of all births in the United States. “These cuts are going to either mean coverage for fewer people or fewer services,” says Dr. Michelle Moniz, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan. “And if those essential health benefits like maternity care and contraception aren’t protected, women and children could be in real danger of losing care.” Ku points out that the Senate bill, like the House bill, also lets states add requirements that a person must be working in order to be eligible for Medicaid. “This could affect, for example, a young mother,” he says. “Medicaid would not cover the costs of her child-care needs, which could create a problem.” Under the new Senate bill, Medicaid reimbursement to Planned Parenthood would be eliminated for at least one year. Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood because the organization provides abortions—even though it’s already illegal for federal money to be used toward these procedures (except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is in danger). With the elimination of Medicaid reimbursement, however, women on Medicaid would not be able to use any of Planned Parenthood’s services, which include well-woman visits, cervical cancer screenings, access to low-cost contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Funding cuts could also lead more Planned Parenthood locations to close. “The bill includes some money to boost community health centers as an alternative, but many of those centers don’t have the trained professionals who can provide long-acting contraceptives and ongoing health-care services that many women need,” says Dr. Hal Lawrence, executive vice president of ACOG. “They’re not equipped to fill that gap.” The Senate bill also eliminates the individual mandate that required all individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax, as well as the requirement for companies with 50 or more employees to provide health coverage for their workers. While the Senate bill does follow the Affordable Care Act’s policy of providing financial assistance based on income (unlike the House bill), those subsidies will be smaller, and eligible to fewer people, than under the current plan. “Because of this, I think we’ll see more people who are uninsured, some by choice and some because they no longer have access to affordable health insurance,” says Moniz. While this is a gender-neutral issue, women face unique circumstances, especially around childbirth, that make health insurance especially important for them, she says. The United States already has the highest maternal mortally rate in the developed world, she says, and reducing coverage for women is very likely to make the problem worse. “It is clear that access to a doctor before and during pregnancy—screening for complications like hypertension and diabetes, having appropriate care during labor and delivery—saves lives and improves health for women and children,” she says. “It’s the foundation of the future of that family’s health.”","JUNE 22, 2017"
Health Care: Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins Voted No | Time,5158,"S
en. John McCain of Arizona’s vote against the “skinny repeal” of Obamacare may have been the most dramatic, but the objections of Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine had already put the bill’s fate in jeopardy. The Senate’s Republican women, including Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, had been left out of the initial drafting process and derailed the Majority Leader’s mid-July effort to repeal Obamacare in order to replace it further down the road. While Capito ultimately voted for the bill, Murkowski and Collins held firm on Friday morning and, along with McCain, joined with Democrats to kill the bill. Here’s who they are. Lisa Murkowski has been a U.S. Senator since 2002, when she was appointed to finish out her father Frank’s term when he was elected governor of the state. She ran for the seat in 2004 and won, but in 2010 she lost the GOP primary to a Tea Party challenger. But ultimately, Murkowski beat both the Tea Party and Democratic candidates and became the first successful write-in candidate since South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond in 1954. She won reelection in 2016. Murkowski has been wary of the process to replace the Affordable Care Act since it began. She has said she could not support a bill that did not expand coverage and left costs high, but was largely concerned with the approach to Medicaid. She was also against including cuts to Planned Parenthood in a repeal measure. According to the Alaska Dispatch News, a quarter of Alaskans receive health coverage via the entitlement program. In July, Murkowski said that while some Alaskans had told her that she should “stick with the president,” most wanted her to put her state’s citizens first. “Almost without exception, it was, ‘Please Lisa. Protect Alaska’s interests,” the Dispatch News reports she said. “Help us with ensuring that the most vulnerable are cared for, and that when it comes to the access issues that we face, the costs that we face, that you can help us address these.'” Murkowski vocalized her displeasure with the secretive Obamacare repeal process in late June, telling an Independent Journal Review reporter that she had not seen a draft of the bill because she is “not a reporter and I’m not a lobbyist.” She, along with Sens. Collins and Capito of West Virginia, later came out against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan to immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act, but hold off on replacing it, effectively killing that effort. Her opposition to the health care plan made her a target of President Donald Trump, who tweeted that she had “really let the Republicans, and our country, down” when she voted against a motion that led to the Friday morning vote. The administration also reportedly called Murkowski and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan threatening that there would be consequences over her position on the repeal. Susan Collins, of Maine, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and was last reelected in 2014. She will be up for reelection again in 2020, though she is said to be seriously considering a run for governor of Maine. It would be her second time vying for the governorship—she lost to independent Sen. Angus King in 1994. Collins has said she could not support the Obamacare repeal because of the impact it would have had on Americans seeking coverage. “I can’t support a bill that will greatly increase premiums for our older Americans,” Collins told MSNBC in June. “I cannot support a bill that is going to result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance.” The Maine Republican was also dismayed by the deep cuts to Medicaid that had been proposed under the repeal legislation and the impact it would have on vulnerable citizens including disabled children and poor seniors.”We should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that’s been on the books for 50 years … without evaluating what the consequences will be,” she said on CNN‘s State of the Union. In a lengthy statement issued Friday, Collins explained the many reasons why she voted against the measures, including her opposition to proposals that would have stripped funding from Planned Parenthood. “Let me be clear that this is not about abortion,” she said. This is about interfering with the ability of a woman to choose the health care provider who is right for her. This harmful provision should have no place in legislation that purports to be about restoring patient choices and freedom. Like Murkowski, Collins faced threats as a result of her position on the repeal. The Associated Press reported Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold complained about the opposition the repeal effort had faced from “some female Senators from the northeast.” During a radio interview, he reportedly said, “if it was a guy from south Texas, I might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style.” She was later caught on a hot mic discussing the threat, with a Senate colleague telling her he thinks she could “beat the s–t” out of the Representative. “Well, he’s huge,” she said in response. “And he — I don’t mean to be unkind, but he’s so unattractive it’s unbelievable.”","UPDATED: JULY 28,"
Roger Marshall: Rep. Says Poor 'Just Don't Want Health Care' | Time,2113,"A
first-term congressman who previously worked as a doctor is facing criticism after saying poor people “just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.” Rep. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, has quickly become part of a group of doctors taking a lead on replacing the Affordable Care Act. The House Republicans released their health care plan on Monday to intense criticism from both liberals and conservatives, with some estimates predicting as many as one in six people could lose health insurance under the GOP plan. So when Marshall made his comments to STAT, a health care-focused website, many saw them as insensitive and out of touch. The remarks came in an interview last week when Marshall was talking about Medicaid, which expanded to more than 30 states under Obamacare, including Republican states. The Congressman told the publication he does not believe Medicaid has helped people. “Just like Jesus said, ‘The poor will always be with us,’” Marshall said in the interview. “There is a group of people that just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.” He added that “morally, spiritually, socially,” poor people and homeless people “just don’t want health care.” Medicaid advocates struck back. “These are people who are out there, working hard, paying their bills, and to have their elected member of Congress pointing their finger at them I’m sure is disappointing,” David Jordan, executive director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, told the Kansas City Star. In defending himself, Marshall said he was trying to explain that creating a national health care policy focused on “one segment of the population” does not work because of various peoples’ needs, according to the Washington Post. “When I said, ‘the poor will always be with us,’ it was actually in the context of supporting the obligation we have to always take care of people, but we cannot completely craft a larger, affordable health-care policy around a comparatively small segment of the population who will get care no matter what,” Marshall said in a statement.","MARCH 9, 2017"
Trump's Healthcare Op-Ed Really Made Jimmy Kimmel Mad | Time,1079,"I
n the wake of Trump’s controversial op-ed in Wednesday’s issue of USA Today, Jimmy Kimmel lashed out at the president’s health care policy. During Wednesday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the late-night host slammed Trump for attacking Democrats over a health care proposal called Medicare for All while claiming that he kept a promise to protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. “You didn’t keep that promise. That promise was forced on you because John McCain gave you the finger and so you weren’t able to not keep that promise,” Kimmel said, referencing the moment that the late Sen. McCain cast the deciding vote against the Republicans’ “skinny repeal” for the Affordable Care Act last year. “And yes, rates will go down in some states, but they would’ve gone down even further in all states if you and your buddies hadn’t spent the last year trying to cripple the plan we have now. This is like claiming you saved people from drowning after you put a hole in the side of the ship.” Watch the full clip of Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s healthcare op-ed below.","OCTOBER 11, 2018"
Coronavirus and Rationing Health Care in the United States | Time,18901,"L
ianne Kraemer knows she’s in a precarious position. She has stage-4, terminal breast cancer that has spread to her brain. To keep it from penetrating further into other organs, she’s currently on chemotherapy, which weakens her body and puts her at high risk for a number of health problems—including infectious diseases like COVID-19. Soon after public health officials identified SARS-CoV-2 virus as the cause of a previously unknown illness in the Hubei province of China, doctors realized that the novel coronavirus seemed to zero in on certain demographics: older people, as well as those with existing chronic diseases and weakened immune systems like Kraemer, 43. “From very early on, I felt vulnerable and scared,” she says. “People were saying ‘everybody don’t worry, this will only affect the sick people.’ I felt vulnerable and expendable.” Now another specter threatens Kraemer’s already tenuous hold on health. If she develops COVID-19, and needs intensive care and help from a ventilator to breathe, she might be denied access. “With my diagnosis of metastatic terminal breast cancer with brain metastases, doctors will go, ‘Wow, she’s on her way out anyway,” she says. “The fact that I could go to the emergency room with COVID-19 and they might deem me not worthy of care is mind-alteringly terrifying.” Anywhere from 3% to 19% of COVID-19 patients will wind up in an intensive care unit (ICU), often requiring ventilators to breathe. The number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is, as of writing, nearing 1 million, which means roughly 150,000 additional patients for the country’s already-stressed ICU system. If the flow of patients continues to outpace the supply of ventilators, doctors will be making heart-wrenching decisions about how to distribute those precious few devices. This is the harsh truth that administrators at Henry Ford Health Systems in Michigan tried to address in a controversial letter that leaked on social media on March 27. The letter was intended for patients (and their families), explaining the facility’s approach to rationing ICU services: “Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive.” The letter, which was part of the hospital’s preparations for emergency actions if supplies to treat patients dwindled, went on to provide a bulleted list of the types of patients who may be “not eligible for ICU or ventilator care,” including those with severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; terminal cancers; and severe trauma or burns. “We crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency,” Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of the Henry Ford Health System wrote on Twitter in response to questions about the letter. “It is our hope we never have to apply them, and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.” “Being in the midst of a public health emergency triggers a change in the ethical principles that we use to make care decisions,” says Dr. Douglas White, director of the program of ethics and decision making in critical illness at the University of Pittsburgh. “A public health emergency shifts focus from individual patients and trying to maximize their well-being, to looking at outcomes for an entire population.” Which means that people with a cancer prognosis like Kraemer might be considered ineligible to receive a bed in an ICU because their chances of survival are low. To Kraemer, this feels like a primitive approach. “I am more than just words on a paper. I am more than a diagnosis of stage-4 cancer,” she says. “There has to be a more sophisticated way than categorically excluding entire populations.” In 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked the state’s Department of Health to develop an algorithm to anticipate the need for ventilators in the event of a flu pandemic like the H1N1 outbreak of 2009. The commission responded with a 272-page report prudently calling for buying up ventilators sufficient for a flu outbreak. Then, COVID-19 made a mockery of all of that planning. With its dense population and popularity as an international travel destination, New York has become ground zero for the U.S. wing of the current pandemic and has completely annihilated whatever formulas the state had in place to allocate resources for prevention and containment of such an outbreak. “COVID-19 is not like the flu at all,” says Dr. Chen Fu, clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center, who has spent the pandemic working in the hospital’s critical-care ward. “We’re finding that these patients who are intubated with COVID-19 lung disease are extremely hard to take off the ventilator. It’s almost like a black hole.” It’s largely this fact that is contributing to the nationwide shortage of ventilators, forcing doctors to make the kinds of existential choices—picking who gets to live and who must die—that both they and their patients would have been spared in the past. “In normal times we practice a sort of hopeful, benevolence-based medicine,” Fu says. “Whereas now we have to practice a sort of holistic justice-based medicine. I have to think about how to help society as a whole.” That involves not just denying care to patients like Kraemer, but sometimes withdrawing it after it’s been provided. Fu and other members of the hospital staff recently faced one such mortal choice when they were treating a terminally ill patient on a high-flow ventilator—a step down from full intubation, and which is also in short supply as a result of the pandemic. The ventilator offered the dying patient not just comfort, but also a certain measure of end-of-life dignity. On another floor, however, a COVID-19 patient who had a greater chance of survival was panting for air and in desperate need of a high-flow ventilator. One machine, two patients, and Fu’s group had to make the call. The algorithm—which was also a part of the 2015 New York State report—made it for them: “We took that machine away from the patient who was dying,” he says. The patient did die, and the experience—for the doctors, the patient and the family—was harrowing. “Whenever you apply statistics to an individual it’s always very messy,” Fu says, “because individuals have their own desires, they have their own history.” Ventilators are currently scarce, but when industry steps up—as the Ford Motor Company and General Motors recently did, committing to build tens of thousands of ventilators each—the gap can be filled relatively fast. Health care workers can’t be ordered up so quickly. “A critical care physician takes a total of 10 years to train,” says Fu, “four years of medical school, three years of residency and three more years of critical care fellowship.” At Boston University’s Boston Medical Center, this has led to on-the-fly staffing decisions. “In the internal medicine units where I work,” says Dr. James Hudspeth, medical director of the COVID-19 response team at Boston Medical, “usually we’re staffing with internists [but] at this point we are pulling in a subset from other specialties to help us out.” The hospital’s nursing team is being similarly stretched, Hudspeth says, with floor nurses, who are not specialists in critical care, being pressed into service alongside ICU nurses. Supplies of medications being called up to alleviate some of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19 are also dwindling. For example, there are developing shortages of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor (which can reduce inflammation and help relieve infection), a fact that’s forcing other tough decisions. Dr. Bushra Mina, chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill Northwell Hospital in New York begins the day with 10 to 20 vials of IL-6 inhibitor. Every time he thinks about using one of these vials, he has to judge whether it might be wiser to save it for a later, more desperate patient. “It’s like military triage,” he says. Hudspeth worries that if an existing drug does prove effective against SARS-CoV-2, there will be a stampede for it—especially if it’s rare or expensive. “It’s instantaneously on the market and then at that point we may also be forced to do more rationing,” he says. Then too there is the COVID-19-related rationing that has nothing to do with COVID-19, at least not directly. Doctors pressed into emergency medicine may no longer be available to their regular patients for appointments to check up on chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. That, in turn, increases the risk of an at-home emergency. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, epidemiologists recorded a spike in deaths from preventable causes, as the epidemic swallowed the health care system whole, leaving the medically vulnerable uncared-for. “I’m confident we’re going to see that play out again [with COVID-19] globally and potentially within the United States,” says Hudspeth, noting that the number of heart attack and stroke patients coming into Boston Medical Center in the last few weeks has been lower than they would normally expect. “They’re probably suffering those at home.” Currently, the U.S. has no national criteria for allocating ICU beds and ventilators during an emergency like a pandemic. So, doctors and hospital officials have largely been relying on the guidelines of professional specialty groups, including those published in 2008 by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), for making decisions about how to allocate scarce resources to treat respiratory disorders. The ACCP guidelines hinge on the so-called “exclusion criteria,” which advise not considering ICU care for people with moderate-to-severe heart or lung disease, those with terminal cancer — like Kraemer— the elderly, and people with severe cognitive impairment. Such policies, says White, are discriminatory from both an ethical as well as legal perspective. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights in April conducted a review of Alabama’s 2010 guidelines for rationing ventilators based on exclusion criteria, for allegedly discriminating based on age and disability. The state has since revised its guidelines to be compliant with federal civil rights laws. The ACCP did not clarify the reasoning behind its guidelines in its official publications, but White says it’s likely that the medical association relied on standard metrics for evaluating patients’ health and, given their medical histories, considered most of them as less likely to survive whatever brought them into the ICU than those without those underlying conditions. After the ACCP put out its guidelines, White and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh felt “that was a very big overreach in terms of abandoning traditional medical ethics in favor of a public health ethic,” he says. “When the lever gets pulled and a public health emergency is declared, that indicates the need to do things differently than we normally do, and to allocate resources differently. But exclusion criteria are the wrong tool for the job. They send the wrong message that people’s lives are being judged not worth saving. The ethics of medicine are diametrically against that kind of thinking.” So White and his colleagues proposed a different framework, which they published in 2009. Their approach assigns a “priority score” to every patient, based on a constellation of factors including existing health conditions, as well as something called “life years gained,” or the likelihood of living beyond the current crisis. Doctors score a patient’s chances of surviving and of living more years once they are discharged, each on a scale of one to four, with one representing the highest likelihood. These two numbers are combined, and the final score determines a patient’s priority for ICU care. The system provides a “brutal reckoning” for how bad the supply shortages are, says White. “If we just exclude people, then those people disappear from the calculus.” But by giving everyone a priority score, this framework accounts for those patients who, in normal circumstances would be treated, but in times of scarce resources, are denied care. “It doesn’t allow us to brush under the rug how bad things are.” For the last decade or so, the framework has been more of a theoretical exercise than a necessity, but that changed when patients began flooding hospitals with COVID-19. “When things began going sideways in China, and again more recently with what happened in Italy, a number of institutions [started] reaching out to me asking about our framework,” says White. “They wanted to know if we were using it [at the University of Pittsburgh] and if it had been incorporated into our hospital policy,” he says. So, he condensed the principles from the original proposal into a “very operational, practical step-by-step recipe hospitals could cut and paste into whatever format they need,” he says, which the University of Pittsburgh published on its website on March 22. The system is inspired by the one used in the U.S. to allocate organs for transplant, which relies on the “lifecycle principle,” taking into account where a person is in their overall life cycle, and how much more life they have left to experience. The lifecycle principle holds that if all other things are equal as far as patients’ priority score, and there is only one ventilator available, doctors could prioritize younger people, who have had less chance to live their lives, over older people who have likely enjoyed more life experiences. It also accounts for “instrumental value,” which suggests prioritizing those who may, if they survive, further the goals of improving public health—health care workers, for example, who could then go on to save more lives. There is clearly interest in an alternative to the current standard of care. In the first three days after they were posted, the new guidelines were downloaded more than 2,000 times; Pennsylvania health authorities have already asked all hospitals in the state to utilize these guidelines, and Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado and Oklahoma have followed suit. There would, of course, be no need for these ethically wrenching choices if there were enough ICU personnel, beds, and other equipment to handle the patient load. In a matter of weeks after the first COVID-19 patients were confirmed, the Chinese government turned arenas into field facilities and erected two entirely new hospitals in Wuhan. In New York City, Mount Sinai Hospital and the charity Samaritan’s Purse worked together to build a 68-bed tent facility in Central Park to care for some of the city’s COVID-19 overflow; the field hospital began receiving patients on March 31. Los Angeles County went New York one better when, on April 13, it opened a 266-bed surge ward within the walls of the recently shuttered St. Vincent’s Hospital. In ordinary circumstances—even an ordinary epidemic—surge hospitals like these wouldn’t be necessary. All hospitals in California are supposed to have a 20% to 40% surge capacity within their own walls, says Dr. Christina Ghaly, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. That capacity is mostly generated by canceling elective surgeries and converting the facilities used for same-day surgery, anesthesia-recovery and even emergency medicine into ICUs. But COVID-19 isn’t an ordinary epidemic and free-standing surge facilities are an important—if imperfect—adjunct. In mid-March, the Los Angeles County and California State departments of health began work on a statistical model projecting one month ahead, which sought to forecast when peak demand for hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators would hit, and what that peak would look like. “What the model showed,” Ghaly says, “is that we had sufficient bed capacity for COVID-19 patients within our existing hospital supply, but there was a shortage of ICU beds.” That added to the impetus to repurpose St. Vincent’s, which came online a month later to fill the gap. Perhaps, however, the U.S. could develop a system that would forestall any sort of care-rationing, even in the midst of a public health disaster like COVID-19. Hudspeth suggests one solution: building a national medical corps not unlike the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which could mobilize fast, get on-site where needed, and have personnel and equipment ready to move when a pandemic hits, much the way FEMA mobilizes for a hurricane. “Not having a system that makes it possible to move personnel and necessary equipment between different parts of states and basically across the United States as a whole is a really glaring gap that we face,” he says. “We could have critical care physicians, infection control specialists, critical care nurses who could work their way across the country as different hot spots flare up.” That would address not only a crying medical need, but a crying ethical one, Hudspeth says, sparing frontline caregivers from having to make the kinds of calls Fu and his colleagues made when they withdrew the ventilator from the terminally ill patient and gave it instead to someone who had a better chance to survive. It would also spare patients like Kraemer, suffering from one disease, from becoming collateral casualties of another one, simply because the resources to care for them are no longer there. When Kraemer learned her breast cancer had spread, her doctor couldn’t guarantee that she would live another two years. That was four years ago, thanks to experimental therapies she tried by participating in a variety of clinical trials. That’s what she hopes doctors will remember if she does need hospitalization for COVID-19. But as it stands, Kraemer has been forced to do the unthinkable and make a case for her life should she get sick with COVID-19. In order to ensure that emergency health care workers look beyond her medical chart to see her as an individual patient, she recorded a video of herself, at her current doctor’s suggestion, to show that, despite being a terminal cancer patient, she does not currently suffer any serious health consequences—and that she deserves potentially life-saving treatment in the ICU, were she to develop COVID-19. “It was scary, and I thought, ‘This is what it’s come to, that I have to prove that my life is worth saving,” she says. “I laid out that I expect to receive ICU placement if I needed it, and that I expect to receive a ventilator if that’s necessary, too. To have hospital administrators essentially write us an early death sentence for something completely terrible that happened to us through no fault of our own—it’s brutal.”","APRIL 22, 2020"
States Are Leading the Way on Public Health Insurance Option | Time,11501,"W
hen Joe Biden ran for president, he campaigned on lowering health care costs and expanding coverage by adding a government-run health insurance option to compete with private insurers. That’s far from becoming a reality at the federal level, but three states have now passed their own versions of a public option—test cases that can reveal the possibilities and pitfalls of implementing such a system in the U.S. Colorado and Nevada both signed public health insurance options into law in June, and Washington state recently updated its public option, first approved in 2019. All three plans are more limited in scope than what Biden and other Democrats have suggested a federal version might look like, but members of Congress are nevertheless watching closely to see how they fare. “I’m really interested in what the states’ experiences have been in enacting and implementing [a public option], what the barriers have been, some of the challenges they see so that we can learn from them and put together legislation that works,” says Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington. She and New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone announced in May that they want to develop new federal public option legislation, and Democratic Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Michael Bennet of Colorado also reintroduced their Medicare X public option plan earlier this year. With an evenly divided Senate and a slim Democratic majority in the House, it’s highly unlikely lawmakers will pass a federal public option any time soon. Instead, Democratic states are tackling what Congress has failed to do ever since Republicans and centrist Democrats spiked a public option plan during the Affordable Care Act (ACA) negotiations in 2009. The new state level public option plans attempt to decrease health care costs by paying lower rates to hospitals, doctors and other medical providers than private insurance companies do. “The unifying theme among the three states is essentially using the power of the state government to try to lower premiums for insurance consumers,” says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. This is a major issue for many Americans. Survey after survey shows that large shares of Americans cannot afford necessary health costs. People frequently skip medications, put off treatments or avoid seeking care altogether, which can hurt their own health and endanger others during a public health crisis. Even before the pandemic, 137 million Americans struggled with financial hardship due to medical bills. Nearly 30 million Americans remain uninsured. More than half of those people are eligible for ACA subsidies or Medicaid plans, but research has shown that concerns about cost deter them from signing up. For the first time in a decade, Democrats need to figure out new political messaging on health care that doesn’t involve defending the ACA. The conservative Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama’s signature health care law in June, marking the end of 11 years of efforts by Republicans to eliminate the law. Biden is focused on passing his infrastructure and care bills, which would make permanent expanded subsidies for Obamacare plans, but do not include more ambitious health care reforms. The party is now in the early stages of coalescing around its next health care priorities, and some hope that advocating for a public option will be one of its next steps. Critics of the public option argue that it’s not the solution, saying that it amounts to a government takeover of health care and could lead to widespread hospital closures. The early test cases in Washington, Colorado and Nevada have already revealed the challenges ahead. Each of the three states faced intense pushback from hospitals and providers, and none was able to implement a true public option—despite retaining Democratic majorities in both houses of their state governments. How the system works in these three states will mark the first experiments in the United States of whether public options on the health care marketplace can help solve the persistent, devastating problem of the country’s ballooning health care costs. If they fail, both Democrats on the far left, who favor a single payer system, and Republicans, who oppose government intervention in health care, could see their critiques vindicated. But if they succeed in lowering costs for consumers, moderate Democrats like Biden could point to the states as proof that a public option holds promise for more Americans in the future. “The momentum is growing,” Murray says. But, she warns: “This is not going to be fast. It’s not going to be easy.” The plans in Washington, Nevada and Colorado were forged by compromise amid intense medical industry opposition. In the end, none of them are truly government-run public options. Instead of plans that are administered by the government, the states are working with private insurance companies to create new health plans that will be overseen and partially designed by the government. This also means the states don’t have to set up whole new infrastructures to administer their own health insurance plans. Rather, the “public” plans will be sold to individuals alongside other private options on the ACA marketplace. Washington was the first state in the country to pass any form of a public option in 2019. But it struggled in its first year. Many hospitals refused to accept the public option plan, called Cascade Select, due to its lower rates of reimbursement. That meant the plans were only available in 19 of the state’s 39 counties and fewer than 2,000 people signed up for the plan. Premiums also didn’t drop as lawmakers hoped; while the state-mandated benefit designs reduced out-of-pocket costs, Cascade Select premiums were an average of 4% higher than average 2020 premiums. Washington is trying to fix these issues with new legislation signed in May. The law will require hospitals to contract with the public option plan in some circumstances and adds premium subsidies that will help people afford the plans starting in 2023. “I was disappointed that we didn’t have a statewide plan,” says state Rep. Eileen Cody, a former nurse who sponsored the 2019 legislation. “But as a first step and considering COVID, I feel like we did okay. And I’m really hopeful waiting to see what happens with ’23.” In Colorado, after the pandemic paused discussion of a public option last year, lawmakers came back in early 2021 with a more aggressive proposal for a true government-run public option. But legislators ultimately reached a compromise with industry groups and scrapped the idea of a state-run plan in favor of mandating that insurers offer standardized public option plans that reduce premiums by 15% over three years. “The hospital lobby’s powerful and they have a lot of money,” says Joe Hanel, director of communications at the nonpartisan Colorado Health Institute, “and you don’t want them spending millions of dollars every year for the next several years trying to tear down what you just built.” Nevada’s plan will require some insurers to bid to offer public option plans with monthly premiums that must start at 5% below the “benchmark” ACA plan in the first year and go down to 15% less over four years. As Colorado and Nevada move forward with their plans, they seem to be taking a cue from Washington’s stumbles. Colorado will require hospitals to accept the public option, and in Nevada, providers who want to accept Medicaid, the state employee health plan or worker’s compensation must accept the public option. Hospitals and providers fought hard against the plans and garnered some major victories, but proponents of a public option have become savvier at selling the idea, too. In general, opponents of public options say that the plans could disrupt people’s current coverage, cost the states money and mean that providers don’t earn enough to cover their costs. Hospitals warn that lower reimbursement rates will make it harder for them to offer necessary services, particularly in rural areas where many are already struggling to operate. There’s also a fierce political debate: Republicans in each state argued that the programs would be expensive to implement and would threaten hospitals and providers after a tough pandemic year, while Democrats asserted a public option would ease costs for patients and help providers by encouraging some uninsured patients to buy the public plans. The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a coalition of health insurers, hospitals and business groups that has lobbied against a public option and other reforms at the federal level, established affiliates in Colorado and Nevada. They ran ads, sent mailers and commissioned research to argue that a public option would harm providers in those states. In Colorado, the Partnership spent more lobbying this year than any other group has since at least 2011, according to the Colorado Sun. “There were millions of dollars spent here because Colorado was looked at as, ‘We let this happen in Colorado, it could happen in other places or go national,’” says Hanel. But proponents of the plans learned to fight the opposition with members of their own, enlisting doctors and insurance executives to talk about why they support a public option. “They try to lump the whole system together and say, well, the system’s against this, doctors, hospitals are all against this,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, an ER doctor and executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care. “Doctors felt this need to stand up and say, wait a minute, we do this because we want to help people. And when we see this legislation that could actually help people, this is something we want to be a part of.” Davidson’s group organized physicians on the ground in each state to write op-eds, appear in commercials and lobby their legislators in favor of the public option. Dr. Harpreet Tsui, an internal medicine doctor in Nevada, said she advocated for the public option legislation after seeing patients cry in her office because they couldn’t afford medications or worried they’d have to stop paying for their insurance. “I think it’s important to put a name and a face to the story,” she says. “Even a patient of mine could open the newspaper and be like, Oh, yeah, there’s Dr. Tsui, this is a good idea.” Former Cigna executive Wendell Potter got involved to call out what he terms “the BS from the other side.” Potter created fact sheets that poked holes in industry talking points, testified in favor of the public option in Nevada, and sent letters directly to lawmakers there and in Colorado. It’s difficult to tell whether the messaging strategy moved the needle on public support for the plans, but the idea is popular: A March poll from Morning Consult found that 68% of Americans supported a public option. And the number of states with a public option could soon double. Connecticut, Oregon and New Mexico have already considered public option legislation, and advocates say they want to keep pushing the idea in more states in the future. Potter, who has been in this fight for more than a decade, is seeing progress. In 2009, he had recently left Cigna and testified for the first time in favor of a public option during the ACA debates. Now, years after that effort was killed, he thinks these state plans can build momentum for the idea. He says: “I am becoming a bit more optimistic.”","JULY 1, 2021"
Donald Trump Fails to Sell GOP on Healthcare Bill | Time,3084,"I
n a full-court press to repeal Obamacare, President Donald Trump summoned moderate lawmakers to the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon to try to convince them to support the Republican health care bill. The president sat with the 15 moderate Republicans in the Oval Office during an intimate meeting, emerging from behind his desk and joining them in a scrum of chairs. He listened carefully to their concerns and gently reminded them of Republicans’ promises to repeal Obamacare. He did not change many minds. “I do think we need to go to a different system, but I don’t think this bill is good enough,” said Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one of the moderates who attended the meeting. “I am a no.” The clock is ticking for Republicans to pass their Obamacare replacement, called the American Health Care Act. The House is set to vote on the replacement on Thursday, and it is far from certain that Republicans will get their bill passed. Moderates are concerned that the Republican replacement put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump would hurt their constituents by causing them to lose health insurance, and would leave current Medicaid recipients uninsured. Some are pushing for a bill that does not freeze the Medicaid expansion in 2020 or cut Medicaid spending as dramatically, others for more larger tax credits, and still others to remove language defunding Planned Parenthood from the legislation. So far, President Trump has been unable to lock down the votes needed to pass the bill. Few moderate lawmakers left the Tuesday afternoon meeting with Trump enthusiastic about the Republican bill. “Nobody jumped up and said I’m a no, but now I’m a yes,” said Rep. Dan Donovan of New York, who attended the meeting with President Trump and is undecided about the bill. “Maybe now they’re contemplating what was said in the meeting and now coming to their conclusions.” Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group, also left the meeting without announcing who he would vote, despite changes made in the Republican bill designed to bring him and his moderate allies into the fold. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump visited Capitol Hill and spoke to the entire Republican House conference, imploring them to repeal the law. “I honestly think many of you will lose your seats in 2018 if you don’t get this done,” Trump said at the larger meeting in the morning. But the hard-right members of the House Freedom Caucus went out as opposed to the bill as they were going in. “If the vote were today, it would not pass,” said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, a Freedom Caucus member who is opposing the bill. “And it would be a significant comfort zone.” Now the problem is that Republicans from both sides are closing in on the bill, with moderates like Donovan and Lance questioning the bill, as are conservatives. “I’d say we got roughly 30 conservatives and 20 throughout the conference” said Rep. David Brat, “who are leaning no, to no.” “They’ve done some constructive stuff,” he said, “but the price [of premiums] has to come down.”","MARCH 21, 2017"
Snake Bite Costs North Carolina Couple $89000 Hospital Bill,1762,"A
couple in North Carolina is speaking out against hospital pricing after receiving a bill for an 18-hour emergency-room stay which they say cost them a whopping $89,000. The Charlotte Observer reports that Eric Ferguson visited a hospital near his home in Mooresville, N.C. over the summer after being bitten by a snake. The four vials of anti-venom medication Ferguson received reportedly cost about $20,000 each. Ferguson and his wife Laura researched the price of the medicine and found its retail price was between $750 and $12,000 per vial. Medicare, they reportedly found, would have paid about $9,460 for the total treatment Though their Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance reduced the bill to a little over $20,000, according to the Charlotte Observer, and they only ended up paying about $5,400 to cover their deductible and co-pay, the couple said they were shocked by the price of treatment. In a 2013 cover story by Steven Brill, Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us, TIME explored the often exorbitant prices patients face after hospital stays.The article examined the reasons behind the prices and the damage caused to those on the receiving end of the American health care system as a result The hospital, Lake Norman Regional, defended their pricing in a statement to the newspaper: “Hospitals only collect a small percentage of our charges, or ‘list prices.’ We are required to give Medicare one level of discount from list price, Medicaid another, and private insurers negotiate for still others. … If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation. … Our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients.” [Charlotte Observer]","JANUARY 19, 2014"
U.S. Health Care Spending Is Double That of Other Countries | Time,2608,"H
ealth care spending in the U.S. is roughly twice that of other high-income nations — but all that extra money isn’t leading to better health, according to a new analysis published in JAMA. A group of researchers compared data from the U.S. and 10 other high-income countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark. They found that spending in the U.S. far outpaces that in other nations. Health care accounts for almost 18% of the U.S.’s GDP, compared to 9.6% to 12.4% in the other developed countries, the paper says. But, contrary to popular belief, the researchers did not find that people in the U.S. use the medical system significantly more often than those in other countries — nor did they find that the way Americans use the medical system accounts for the disconnect in spending. Underinvestment in social services didn’t appear to explain the difference, either. Instead, high prices for labor and goods, including drugs, procedures and administrative services, seemed to be the major reasons, according to the analysis. Prescription drug prices in the U.S., for example, were consistently higher than those in any of the other countries, sometimes commanding double the next-highest cost. Medical procedures were similarly overpriced in the U.S., and American medical professionals also make significantly more money than their peers in other countries, according to the paper. Despite the money poured into the U.S. health care system, however, Americans aren’t healthier than people in other countries — just the opposite, in fact. The U.S. had the shortest life expectancy and highest infant mortality rate of any country included in the analysis, as well as the highest obesity rate. The U.S. also had the lowest health-adjusted life expectancy, or the average length of time a person lives in good health: 69 years, compared to a mean of 72 years in the other areas. At roughly 10%, the U.S. also has the highest percentage of residents without coverage for basic health care services, even after accounting for insurance gains seen since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The results suggest that people looking to lower U.S. health care spending should look beyond factors commonly blamed for the imbalance — such as utilization of the medical system — when searching for solutions, the researchers write in the paper. “As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system,” they write, “data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.”","MARCH 13, 2018"
Bernie Sanders Open to Middle Class Tax Hike for Healthcare | Time,3772,"B
ernie Sanders told TIME on Sunday that he would be willing to raise taxes on the middle class in order to guarantee universal healthcare, after months of weathering attacks from Hillary Clinton. When asked in an interview in Charleston, South Carolina, on Sunday which of his big-ticket proposals would cost the middle class more in taxes, the insurgent presidential candidate said “I think if we can guarantee healthcare to all people comprehensive healthcare, no deductibles, and if we can cut people’s healthcare bill substantially.” Sanders disputed to TIME it was a middle-class tax hike, saying it would ultimately save taxpayers money by cutting out private health insurers. He added that Clinton’s attacks over the bills were a “distortion of reality.” “What media sometimes does, what my opponent does, what Republicans do, is they really try to take a cheap shot. If you were paying $10,000 in private health insurance and I said to you, guess what, you ain’t going to pay that $10,000 and more but you’re going to pay $5,000 more in healthcare premiums, you’d be jumping up and down for joy. You save $5,000 on your healthcare bills,” Sanders told TIME. “It’s disingenuous. I’ve heard this my whole life,” Sanders continued, arguing the legislation would save money. The Senator’s comments on Sunday appear to backtrack from statements he made last month, when he said he would not raise taxes for any program except paid family leave. At the heart of the debate between Clinton and Sanders over taxes is the question of what programs the federal government should be willing to pay for. Sanders has long supported a single-payer healthcare system in the style of European countries and Canada that he calls “Medicare for all,” saying the program would guarantee healthcare for all Americans and greatly reduce healthcare bills. But Sanders has never firmly answered how as president he would pay for the proposal, which many have estimated to cost upwards of $15 trillion over 10 years. Legislation he has repeatedly introduced in the past has indicated he would raise taxes on the middle class, including a 2.2% income tax and a 6.7% tax on employers. Since then, Sanders has walked back his earlier proposals, saying that he would only be willing to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for paid family leave. Sanders’ policy advisor, Warren Gunnels, told TIME last month that the government could pay for single-payer healthcare without raising taxes on the middle class. A Facebook post by Sanders supporter and former President Bill Clinton advisor Robert Reich indicated Sanders was planning to release his healthcare plan today Read More: Why Bernie Sanders’ Tax Pledge Matters In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press last month, Sanders was asked whether he would not raise taxes on the middle class for any reason—except to pay for paid family leave. “Yes, that’s right,” Sanders said. “Look, we have seen a huge transfer of wealth from the middle-class to the top one-tenth of 1%.” Read More: Clinton and Sanders Set for High-Stakes Democratic Debate The Clinton campaign has repeatedly attacked Sanders for being willing to raise taxes on the middle class. The former Secretary of State has promised not to raise taxes on the middle earners, drawing fire from progressives who argue that would necessarily curtail her domestic agenda. Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told TIME in November that Clinton’s criticism was a “Republican approach.” “Why [do] you have a candidate who claims to be a progressive that is essentially laying out an approach to problems that is a Republican approach?” Weaver said of Clinton two months ago. “It’s an instinctive move back to the corporate centrism that the Democratic rank and file has disavowed.”","JANUARY 17, 2016"
Medical Workers Face Coronavirus Mental Health Crisis | Time,7379,"A
s a critical care doctor in New York City, Monica is used to dealing with high-octane situations and treating severely ill patients. But she says the COVID-19 outbreak is unlike anything she’s seen before. Over the past few weeks, operating rooms have been transformed into ICUs, physicians of all backgrounds have been drafted into emergency room work, and two of her colleagues became ICU patients. While Monica is proud of her coworkers for rising to the challenge, she says it’s been hard for them to fight a prolonged battle against a deadly, highly contagious illness with no known cure. To make matters worse, Monica recently tested positive for COVID-19, and she believes she brought the virus home to her husband. Both have gotten sick and are improving, but he had a much harder time with the disease than she did. Monica says that, while she’s used the inherent risk of her job, she feels her hospital failed to protect her and her family — and she blames herself, in part, for her husband’s illness. “There’s this sinking feeling that you have,” says Monica, who requested anonymity because she feared professional repercussions for speaking candidly, “not only, like, the hospital let you down, and that the system let us down as doctors and didn’t protect us, but then I didn’t protect my own family.” In hospitals around the world, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers like Monica are fighting an enemy that has already killed more than 95,000 people, including over 16,000 in the United States. And as with any war, the fight against COVID-19 will result not just in direct casualties, but also take a terrible toll on the minds of many of those who survive. It will be years before the mental health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is fully understood, but some early data already paints a bleak picture. A study published March 23 in the medical journal JAMA found that, among 1,257 healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients in China, 50.4% reported symptoms of depression, 44.6% symptoms of anxiety, 34% insomnia, and 71.5% reported distress. Nurses and other frontline workers were among those with the most severe symptoms. In interviews with TIME, several doctors and nurses said that fighting COVID-19 is making them feel more dedicated to their profession, and determined to push through and help their patients. However, many also admitted to harboring darker feelings. They’re afraid of spreading the disease to their families, frustrated about a lack of adequate protective gear and a sense they can’t do enough for their patients, exhausted as hours have stretched longer without a clear end in sight, and, most of all, deeply sad for their dying patients, many of whom are slipping away without their loved ones at their side. It’s those lonely deaths that have hit the hardest for some. Natalie Jones, an ICU-registered nurse at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton in New Jersey, says it’s been agonizing to have to turn away people who want to visit their loved ones one last time. She’s trying to find ways to be compassionate where she can — last week, she passed on a message from a patient’s wife just before he died: “That they love him, and it’s O.K. to go.” But even simply carrying a message of such emotional weight can take a toll. “We carry that burden for the families, too,” says Jones, who’s having difficultly sleeping without nightmares. “And we understand it’s so difficult that they can’t be there. And that hurts us too. As nurses, we’re healers, and we’re compassionate. It hits very close to home for us as well.” “We’re all affected,” adds Jones, whose already hectic schedule has gotten even more intense amid the outbreak, costing her the sleep that might otherwise help her cope with what she’s experiencing. “To say that we’re not would be a lie.” The coronavirus is taking a mental toll even on those medical experts who aren’t on the front lines. Since the start of the outbreak, Dr. Morgan Katz, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, has been advising nursing homes and long-term care centers on dealing with the coronavirus. But she’s struggling with the gap between what she believes to be the proper procedures and what’s actually possible in this crisis. Many of the facilities she’s advising are suffering from a lack of protective equipment, limited staffing and insufficient testing, and a sense of helplessness is taking hold. “We didn’t have the resources before this that we needed, and this has completely strapped them beyond anything feasible,” says Katz. “It’s so sad. I really feel for these nursing homes and the staff of these nursing homes, because I truly believe that they’re trying to do the right thing. But I really don’t feel like they’re being protected the way that we need to protect them.” Finding ways to support medical workers’ mental health could be a key component in the fight against COVID-19. Dr. Albert Wu, professor of health policy and management and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that evidence from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that failing to support healthcare workers in a crisis, including by not providing enough protective gear, can erode their “wellbeing and resilience,” ultimately leading to chronic burnout. Some healthcare workers could leave the profession, be absent more often from work, or develop PTSD, and any preexisting mental health conditions could be exacerbated. Furthermore, healthcare workers are human like the rest of us, and under extreme stress, they could be prone to making mistakes — which could lead to worse outcomes for patients, and further erode doctors’ and nurses’ mental health. “We can’t get away from our physiology,” says Wu. If healthcare workers can’t provide the care they typically believe is medically necessary for their patients, they may experience a phenomenon known as “moral injury,” says Dr. Wendy Dean, a psychiatrist and the co-founder of the nonprofit Fix Moral Injury. Dean says that American healthcare providers are used to doing anything and everything to help their patients, but inadequate protective gear and triage procedures will force them to make “exquisitely painful” decisions, such as choosing whether or not to risk infecting themselves, their family and other patients in order to help everyone in their care. Still, Dean says the scope of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers won’t come into focus until the more immediate problem has ebbed. “When I think the real challenge is going to come is when the pandemic eases up and people start having time to process,” she says. “All that they’ve seen, all that they’ve done, all that they’ve felt and pushed away.” Several healthcare workers said that, amid all the uncertainty and horrors, they have found some relief in drawing upon support from their families, communities, and one another. Monica, for one, says her friends brought food to her and her husband after they got sick, and she deeply appreciated the support. She’s also proud of the way her colleagues have come together as a team to fight the virus. “There has been a real feeling of, everybody’s in the trenches together,” she says. “What I’ve been most amazed about is people have really risen to that call.” Please send tips, leads, and stories from the frontlines to virus@time.com.","APRIL 10, 2020"
Healthcare Bill: CBO Shows Donald Trump's Broken Promises | Time,4163,"The Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its financial assessment of the American Health Care Act, Congressional Republican’s alternative for Obamacare, estimating that it would increase the number of uninsured to 24 million by 2026 and reduce the federal deficit by $337 million. But the estimate also means that, if the bill becomes policy and the CBO’s conjectures are accurate, President Trump, who has voiced his support for it, will be breaking several promises he made to the American people about health care. Here’s what he’s promised — and how the CBO says the new plan will not deliver on them. 1. “I am going to take care of everybody.” Trump told the Washington Post in an interview shortly before his inauguration that he was aiming to replace President Obama’s Affordable Care Act with a plan that would try and provide universal insurance, although he did not give specific details. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us,” Trump told the Post. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody.” Over a year earlier, in September 2015, he had told Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes, “I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.” The Congressional Budget Office begs to differ. By 2018, the CBO estimates that 14 million additional people would be uninsured, a number that would rise to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026. “In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law,” the CBO wrote in its assessment. 2. “Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.” In September 2015, Trump lamented about the increase in premiums under Obamacare in an interview on 60 Minutes, using them as a reason to justify repealing the law. “Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what’s going on with premiums where they’re up 45, 50, 55 percent,” he told Scott Pelley. Appearing on the show again after he was elected, in November of 2016, he said his version of health care would not only be superior to Obamacare in substance, but in cost. “It’ll be great health care for much less money. So it’ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.” But, according to the CBO, average premiums would initially increase by 15 to 20% in 2018 and 2019 under the American Health Care Act. The costs would start to recede in 2020, and would ultimately decrease 10% by 2026, but the CBO estimates that they would continue to rise for the elderly and decrease for the young, because insurers would be allowed to charge the former up to 5 times as much as they can under Obamacare. Overall, the CBO says, higher premiums would also be a reason some people decline insurance entirely. 3. “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.” Trump prided himself as an unconventional candidate for the Republican Party, a term that extended to his policy proposals. On May 7, 2015, before he even officially announced his candidacy, he tweeted, “I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.” But under the American Health Care plan, federal spending for Medicaid would be reduced by $880 million. A huge reason the number of uninsured would climb is because of the cuts to Medicaid. As the CBO explains: “The reductions in insurance coverage between 2018 and 2026 would stem in large part from changes in Medicaid enrollment—because some states would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped.” Although the CBO estimates that Medicare spending would increase under the American Health Care Act, the AARP has written a letter to Congress arguing that the bill would “weaken Medicare’s fiscal sustainability.”  ","MARCH 13, 2017"
How Steve Jobs' Medical Experience Informed the Apple Watch | Time,4873,"T
he Apple Watch recently celebrated its first birthday. While Apple won’t say exactly how many units have been sold, we estimate the number is in the 13-15 million range, bringing in $2-3 billion in revenue. That’s not bad for what some consider a failed product. I recently spent time with Apple executives involved with the Watch. I asked them to explain the real motivation for creating the device. Although Apple has made fashion and design a key cornerstone of its existence, it turns out that this was not at the heart of why they created this product. The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs developed pancreatic cancer in 2004. He then spent a great deal of time with doctors and the healthcare system until his death in 2011. While that personal health journey had a great impact on Jobs personally, it turns out that it affected Apple’s top management, too. During this time, Jobs discovered how disjointed the healthcare system can be. He took on the task of trying to bring some digital order to various aspects of the healthcare system, especially the connection between patients, their data, and their healthcare providers. If you look at Apple’s current health initiatives, many are focused on helping people record data of all types and get it securely to their healthcare providers. Apple also has projects related to healthcare records, management and interaction between the doctor and patient with a goal of making the patient-doctor relationship more fruitful and less frustrating. I have long been observing these key moves around healthcare, which accelerated after Jobs’ death. It seems clear that Apple’s management has now and will continue to have a major focus on bridging the gap between a person and their healthcare providers. I believe Apple is on a mission to improve the overall health of its customers as well as that of the healthcare system, a task Jobs gave them before he died. And while Apple’s products define Jobs’ legacy, it may turn out that his and Apple’s greatest contribution may be to bring greater order to the fragmented healthcare world. It is within this backdrop that the Apple Watch was born. Apparently, Apple was looking at ways to deliver on Jobs’ goal of making their customers healthier by using technology to help monitor and track health related data points. It became clear to them that they would need some type of mobile device platform to do this. They concluded that a standard fitness tracker couldn’t do the types of things Jobs and current Apple executives really wanted to see. That’s how the Apple Watch came about. Although the Apple Watch came to market years after Jobs’ death, and it’s not clear that he even knew about the Watch, it does seem he was aware that a mobile device would be needed to enhance health monitoring. But given the Apple Watch’s exceptional health related tracking, monitoring and motivational functions, I am convinced he would be delighted with it. While fitness trackers are great, it takes something like the Apple Watch and a serious platform and ecosystem of compatible devices to deliver on things like HealthKit, ResearchKit and CareKit, all designed to create and gather the kind of information that could be used in monitoring users’ personal medical needs. Apple is serious about the role of the Apple Watch in its customers’ health. I was recently able to visit one of Apple’s labs dedicated to sports and health. For 12 hours a day, six days a week, Apple brings in Apple employees of every shape, condition and ethnicity to do various exercises and monitor them with the most sophisticated medical systems available. Apple has seven full-time nurses in the facility I visited, using medical monitoring equipment that can determine all types of heath related data points. The lab even has special chambers that can simulate temperate and weather conditions, in which various exercises or activities can be monitored. Apple’s goal with these lab experiments is to fine tune the sensors, radios, and various monitoring technologies included in the Apple Watch and the iPhone. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company also wants to create new features for future iterations. The more I look at Apple’s health initiatives and things like the Apple Watch, the more I see a grander plan to to make its customers healthier and help reform the healthcare system. If Apple’s current leaders are successful with their healthcare focus, the company’s impact on that world could be Jobs’ greatest legacy.

Why Insulin is So Much Cheaper in Germany Than in the U.S. | Time,6290,"E
very now and then, Katie West considers returning to the U.S. She moved to Germany for graduate school three years ago and now works as a health systems researcher in Hamburg. Her family is an ocean away. Then she remembers why she stays. West, 30, has had type 1 diabetes since she was three years old. Back in Seattle, where she used to live, she typically paid $70 per month for insulin and another $130 for pump supplies. That was a relative steal in the U.S., made possible by her excellent health insurance, which she got through her employer. But still, it was a financial strain. In Germany, she pays about €10, roughly $11. Every three months. “I don’t ever have to worry,” she says. “There is not a day I ever have to worry about if I can pay for something, or manage something.” The price of insulin has increased globally in recent years, but no wealthy country has felt the impact as acutely as the U.S., where the cost has more than doubled since 2012, going from on average $344 per prescription that year to $666 in 2016, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, and continually climbing since. Germany is one of many Western nations, including England and Canada, which empower their governments to actively negotiate prescription drug prices, in turn holding consumer costs in check. The U.S. has no such system in place, and last year some 13.2% of the 2.9 million people who took insulin in the country did not take it as prescribed, and 24.4% asked their doctor for a lower-cost medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West, like 90% of German residents, is on one of the country’s many public insurance plans, which are administered through non-profit insurance companies. She pays for that benefit: maybe a third of her paycheck is withheld each month for taxes, health care and other social services. But in exchange, the coverage—including that of prescription drugs—is generous. Germany has an easier time financing prescription coverage because these drugs cost less there. When a new drug comes to the German market, an independent panel assesses its effectiveness and whether its treatment value is commensurate with the manufacturer’s proposed price. Drugs serving a similar purpose or delivering the same benefit get grouped together. The panel sets a maximum price that insurers will pay for these medications―a practice known as “reference pricing.” Since most German residents are on public health insurance plans, and these plans are tightly regulated, there aren’t many ways for insurance providers to compete with one another. One option they do have, however, is to negotiate lower prices on prescription meds with drug manufacturers. German law requires public plans to cap out-of-pocket health care costs, and to cover all medically necessary treatment, including insulin. For people with chronic conditions—like West—the out-of-pocket limit is set at 1% of household income. For those without such a condition, out-of-pocket costs are capped at 2%. After you hit the limit, the plan pays the rest; that’s why West’s insulin costs are so low. In fact, German diabetes patients have some of the lowest out-of-pocket costs in the world for insulin, according to T1 International, an advocacy group for people with type 1 diabetes. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the climbing price of insulin has lit up both Capitol Hill and the 2020 presidential campaign trail, especially as voters call high-out-pocket costs their biggest health care concern, according to a June 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation poll. A February KFF poll from the same year shows that almost two-thirds of Americans queried support more government regulation of drug pricing. Lawmakers in D.C. have proposed legislation to that effect, like the bipartisan “Insulin Price Reduction Act,” which specifically targets the diabetes drug, and the “Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act,” proposed by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, which includes regulating insulin pricing as one of a series of broader proposals. Legislators have also hauled in insulin manufacturers for congressional questioning, but these efforts have foundered in the face of congressional legislative inertia, partisan in-fighting over the best path forward, and intense pharmaceutical-industry lobbying. Ken Inchausti, a Novo Nordisk spokesman, says a reference-pricing approach like Germany’s is incompatible with the American market. Instead of tackling drug prices, he says, policymakers should look at how insurance plans pay for insulin. A White House proposal first floated last fall to tie Medicare payments for some drugs to prices paid in European countries―including Germany―would do just that, at least for the public sector. But that plan, which aligns with ideas put forth by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has elicited vocal pushback from the pharmaceutical industry and other conservative groups, which have blanketed D.C. in critical advertisements. Powerful Senate Republicans have come out against the proposal, including Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who argued this summer that it would hamper innovation. Germany’s system isn’t perfect. West says she now pays more for basic over-the-counter medicines than for insulin. She asks her family to bring her ibuprofen when they visit, for example, because the price she would pay in Germany is roughly double the cost of the over-the-counter drug in the U.S. But West is still happier in Germany. “Why would I go back? It’s thousands of dollars a year I’m going to have to spend on the same [insulin] I get here for nothing.” The peace of mind alone makes it worth it. “A third of my income may go to taxes and health care here, but honestly, that’s fine. Take it. Take it!” she says. “I don’t have to worry.” KHN correspondent Shefali Luthra reported this story from Germany as a 2019 Arthur F. Burns Fellow. The Arthur F.

Racism Is Part of the Health Care Debate | Time,6071,"L
ast month, the Congressional Budget Office released its evaluation of the House of Representative’s American Health Care Act. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the AHCA would, if it becomes law, leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by the end of the decade. While the Senate’s newly unveiled bill will receive similar scrutiny in the coming days, much has rightly been made of this figure and the consequences of so many losing vital coverage. Proponents have framed the legislation as a chance for Americans to take personal responsibility for their health, while opponents have decried its potential to sicken and kill many of our most vulnerable citizens. These concerns are valid. The bill stands to do great harm. In the midst of this debate, with so many slogans and statistics in the air, it is important to discuss not just the harm that will come from lack of coverage, but the reasons why so many Americans are sick in the first place. Repealing the current health care law — the Affordable Care Act — would be catastrophic precisely because the need for such a law is so great. Responding to this need is not just a matter of politics, it is a question of justice. A story, to explain why. In 1977, the Voyager 1 spacecraft lifted off into the cosmos. The craft’s mission, which remains ongoing, is to explore the universe, to “boldly go” where no human-made object has gone before. In case Voyager 1 is ever encountered by curious extraterrestrials, it carries a golden record imprinted with a range of carefully-selected recordings. They include bird calls, a human heartbeat, the sound of waves breaking against the shore, and a number of musical selections. Among these recordings is a song called “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground,” by the blues singer Blind Willie Johnson. The song was selected by the astrophysicist Carl Sagan, who thought it reflected the familiar human experience of “nightfall with no place to sleep.” No one is sure what the song is about. It has no lyrics. It is composed of moans, of raw feeling. Some say it is about the crucifixion of Christ. Suffering is its clear theme, though whether or not Johnson saw suffering as redemptive is a question only he could have answered. Certainly he knew hardship. Born in 1897, in Texas, the story goes that, when Johnson was young, his stepmother threw lye in his face out of spite for his father’s infidelity. Blind and penniless, Johnson played and preached on the streets to earn a living. In 1945, his house burned down. With nowhere to go, he lived in the ruins, sleeping on a damp bed until he caught malaria and died. His wife said she tried to take him to a hospital but he was refused treatment, either because he was blind or because he was black. I tell this story because it is the story of health in the United States, as far too many Americans still experience it. On the surface, Johnson’s life may seem like the tragedy of an individual. It is not. His fate was determined by powerful social, economic and environmental forces that, taken together, shape the wellbeing of populations at the structural level. For example, the brutality of Johnson’s upbringing was no outlier. Black children in America are far likelier to witness violence than white children. And while he may have succumbed to malaria, his true killer was poverty, a poverty which remains acute in the US. We also know the data behind racial disparities in health care. While doctors can no longer legally turn patients away because of race, pernicious gaps in treatment continue to undermine the health of black populations. “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground,” is the product of a life shaped by injustice. Racism, abuse, lack of medical care, racism again; these are the factors that determined Johnson’s health. Nearly a century after he recorded his song, his reality remains true for millions of Americans born in a certain place, in a certain skin, under certain economic and social conditions that we as a people still have not fully addressed. Unfortunately, our national conversation about health in general, and health care in particular, rarely acknowledges how injustice shapes the health of populations. In the U.S., when we talk about health, we tend to focus on the medicines we take, doctor’s visits, the amount of exercise we manage to squeeze in — in short, our individual behavior. It is not hard to see why we would think this way. With our collective emphasis on lifestyle as the primary driver of health, we are, in a sense, culturally conditioned to view poor health as a consequence of poor decision-making. It takes little imagination to assume that someone is obese because she has made a choice to eat too much. It takes more effort to consider how her obesity represents the convergence of many contextual factors over which she has little or no control. In reality, obesity is caused by the same injustice that inspired “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.” It is caused by poverty. Junk food is cheap, and poor neighborhoods frequently lack high-quality markets that carry a nutritious selection of ingredients. We can reduce obesity by reducing poverty, as well as through policy solutions like taxing sugary drinks. Am I saying that in order to have healthy populations, we must somehow cure racism and poverty? That we must change our society at the structural level, shifting entrenched norms, often in the face of powerful political resistance? Yes, I am. Say that Blind Willie Johnson had received treatment for his malaria, the best money could buy. He still would have had to return to the same bed of ashes, the same destitute conditions that made him vulnerable to disease in the first place. A society that condemns people to such a fate is not a healthy society. Even if overall wellbeing improves, as long as marginalized groups remain disproportionately at risk of preventable hazards, we have failed to meet our obligations to one another. To truly make a difference, the cause of justice must become the cause of health.","JUNE 22, 2017"
Obama: Enough Young Healthcare Enrollees for Program to be ...,1503,"P
resident Barack Obama said Friday that there are enough enrollees in the marketplaces for his signature health care law for the private insurance exchanges to be successful. In an interview with WebMD’s Lisa Zamosky, the President noted that his administration announced this week that 4.2 million people have enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, saying the figure “is already large enough that I’m confident the program will be stable.” The exchanges require a delicate demographic balance, with enough young and healthy customers to subsidize older, sicker enrollees. Data released by the Department of Health and Human Services this week showed that enrollment by young people has lagged administration targets. Obama also admitted that some Americans may end up having to change their healthcare providers in order to save money under the law, an apparent walk-back from his pledge that “if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.” “For the average person, many folks who don’t have health insurance initially, they’re going to have to make some choices,” Obama said. “They might end up having to switch doctors, in part because they’re saving money. But that’s true if your employer suddenly decides that we think this network is going to give a better deal.” Obama also defended the law from criticism that it is raising employer-provided coverage premiums, saying premiums were rising well before the law was passed. He added that the law is helping to slow the pace of growth.","MARCH 14, 2014"
Health Care Bill Would Lead to 23 Million Fewer Insured | Time,4172,"T
he Republican bill to repeal Obamacare would result in 23 million fewer people having health insurance by the year 2026, according to a long-awaited and nonpartisan forecast, upending the healthcare system and scrambling insurance markets. According to the forecast released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 14 million fewer people would have health insurance next year under the Republican bill, increasing to a total of 19 million in 2020. By 2026, a total of 51 million people would be uninsured, roughly 28 million more than under Obamacare. That is roughly equivalent to the loss in coverage under the first version of the bill, which failed to pass the House of Representatives. Much of the loss in coverage would be due to the Republican plan to shrink the eligibility for Medicaid; for many others—particularly those with preexisting conditions living in certain states—healthcare on the open marketplace would become unaffordable. Some of the loss would be due to individuals choosing not to get coverage. The Republican bill, dubbed the American Health Care Act, would also raise insurance premiums by an average of 20 percent in 2018 compared with Obamacare, according to the CBO, and an additional 5 percent in 2019, before premiums start to drop. It would reduce the deficit slightly, by $119 billion over the next 10 years. Wednesday’s CBO forecast creating fresh political challenges for the Republican Party. The healthcare bill passed the House of Representatives on May 4 without any Democratic support; Republicans in the Senate are now working on the bill in an effort to pass it through the upper chamber without Democratic votes. The CBO score will likely make passing a bill out of the Senate more difficult. Before the release of the Congressional Budget Office’s score, the Republican bill had little popular support, with just 21% of American approving of it, according to a recent poll. Obamacare is more popular than it has been in years, with 55% approving of it, according to an April poll, though many markets have seen premium increases and drops in coverage. In a rush to pass the bill while they had enough Republican support, House leaders chose to hold a vote to repeal Obamacare before receiving a score from the Congressional Budget Office—a highly unusual move for such a momentous bill. The CBO score released on Wednesday suggests it may have been wise to pass the bill early: had there been a CBO score earlier, Republicans may not have been able to pass AHCA in its current form. The Republican bill passed the House with 217 votes, just one more than the 216 required to pass it. The AHCA rolls back the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in states that chose to raise the eligibility form the poverty line to 133% of the poverty line. It also dramatically cuts Obamacare subsidies to low- and middle-income earners, defunds Planned Parenthood and cuts taxes on the wealthy. It also repeals the individual mandate in Obamacare, which required everyone to have insurance. The version of the AHCA that passed the House added a crucial new provision, named the MacArthur Amendment, after the New Jersey congressman who proposed it. The MacArthur Amendment allows states to “opt-out” of Obamacare regulations, including an Obamacare requirement that insurance companies charge the same prices to those with preexisting medical conditions as everyone else. Under the MacArthur Amendment, people who live in “opt-out” states and have a medical condition, like cancer, diabetes, asthma or arthritis, will likely face “extremely high premium” according to the CBO. The MacArthur Amendment also means that in certain states insurers do not have to provide certain “essential health benefits”—coverage for prescription drugs, maternity care or emergency services, all of which were required under Obamacare. According to the CBO, about one-sixth of the population lives in states that would opt-out from both “essential health benefits” and from requiring that people with pre-existing conditions are covered at the same rates. One-half the population lives in states that would keep Obamacare’s regulations.","MAY 24, 2017"
Barack Obama Slams Obamacare Repeal Effort | Time,2774,"B
arack Obama waded into the debate on healthcare Tuesday, sharply criticizing Republicans’ last-ditch attempts to repeal his signature legislative achievement. “When I see those people trying to undo that hard-won progress, for the 50th or 60th time, with a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions … it’s aggravating,” Obama said Wednesday during a keynote speech at Goalkeepers, an event hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He noted that there is no “demonstrable economic, actuarial, or even human rationale for pushing such a bill.” “The legislation that we passed was full of things that needed to be fixed,” Obama said. “It was not perfect; it was better.” The former President has spoken about the healthcare debate before, working it into his speech when he received the Profile in Courage award at the John F. Kennedy presidential library earlier this year and releasing a public statement after Senate Republicans released a version of repeal legislation in June. His remarks Wednesday come as another version of repeal, written by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, is gaining support among Republicans. Republicans are pushing against a Sept. 30 deadline to garner 50 votes in favor of the legislation. After the 30th, they will need 60 votes to pass reform, an impossible task given Democrats’ universal opposition. Aside from the bit on healthcare, Obama’s remarks were largely apolitical, and mainly focused on the impact private citizens like the Gates’ can have in effecting global change. This type of commitment, he said, defines his optimism about the future, despite what he called “a steady stream of bad news and cynicism we’re fed on television and Twitter.” However, he did insinuate that, with the Trump Administration intent on undoing many of his achievements, such as withdrawing from the Paris climate deal, it is incumbent on citizens to keep fighting, highlighting climate change in addition to healthcare. “Even if the federal government isn’t engaged on this effort right now, it’s because of efforts like Bill’s, and a whole host of entrepreneurs, and universities, and cities, and states, that America and the world will ultimately meet this challenge separate from what government is doing and that gives me hope,” he said. Aside from his comments about healthcare, former President has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office eight months ago. He spoke up after Trump announced earlier this month that he was rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, which he had implemented under executive action in 2012. On Tuesday evening, he tweeted his support for the victims of the earthquake in Mexico.  ","SEPTEMBER 20, 2017"
2020 Democratic Debate Will Likely Skip Key Healthcare Issue | Time,7270,"G
racyn Robinson is a single mom of three. The 48-year-old worries about putting her kids through school, paying her rent and maintaining her job security as an interior designer for senior centers. But, on top of that already considerable load, she’s most worried these days about her parents. They’re in Kennebunkport, Maine, a 90-minute drive from where she lives in Lexington, Mass. They missed putting their names down for an independent living community in the early years of their retirement, and are now 79 and 80, too far along in their care to qualify for a continuing care retirement community. Robinson fears that her mom, who has already had three bad falls, is one fall away from needing full-time care, and her parents are already burning through much of their retirement savings paying for part-time, in-home care, subsidized by their Medicare Advantage Plan. She worries that they’ll need to come and live with her soon, or that she’ll have to help them pay for care just as her 16-, 14- or 12-year-old is heading to college. Like most Americans, Robinson was shocked to discover that Medicare doesn’t pay for long-term care. “These days we have paid assisted fertility, paid parental leave,” says Robinson. “But we really need paid senior help, paid senior leave. How can anyone maintain job security if they can’t maintain their parents’ health?” Robinson is one of the 45% of Americans who worry that a healthcare event could soon bankrupt them. But, like many, she doesn’t hear any of the Democratic candidates addressing her issues. As Democratic presidential hopefuls gather this week for the first primary debates, all the buzz about health has been about Medicare-for-all. While nice sounding, such a program would do nothing for the most pressing health crisis facing the nation: the millions of Baby Boomers who are in need of, or soon will need, long-term care. As many as 70% of Boomers over retirement age will eventually need long-term care, yet only 30% have saved anything in preparation for such care, according to estimates from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which tracks retirement data. “With aging parents and still needing childcare for my children while I’m at work as a single mother, the pressure on both ends is extreme,” Robinson says. “A lot of this is driven by immigration—there’s no one left for care at either end—but a lot is also driven by government and politicians lacking policies to address the issues.” As the Trump Administration has moved to limit the number of immigrants, this has exacerbated a market already short on workers. On average, senior living communities in the U.S see a 75% percent staff turnover annually, as frontline staff is lured away to better paying, or easier jobs in retail or the gig economy. Every day, an estimated 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65, the traditional retirement age. America is already short more than 1 million family caregivers—family members caring for those in need versus paid caregivers— and as the Boomers age, that shortage is estimated to grow to 4 million by 2030. So just as the need for care will be the greatest, the supply and, likely, quality of it will be the lowest. This will lead to a ballooning of the cost of care, threatening to bankrupt most middle-class Americans by 2050, unless something is done to change the system. And yet long-term care is not central to any of the candidates’ Medicare-for-all plans and few ever mention on the campaign trail the largest driver of long-term care expenses: Alzheimer’s and dementia. Only one candidate’s plan, Bernie Sanders’, even addresses long-term care; a plan that outside analysts estimate could cost $30 trillion over a decade and only has 14 cosponsors in Congress—a virtual non-starter, legislatively-speaking. “Medicare was never designed to finance long-term care, the cost of which would instantly bankrupt an already underfunded program,” says Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the author of The Price We Pay, to be published later this year. “Medicare for all may sound attractive but in reality, it’s a futile whack-a-mole approach to the real issues driving up the cost of health care.” Though polls show health care consistently is one of the top concerns for most American voters, including Democratic primary voters, they don’t seem as interested in getting into the details of policy. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 4% of Democratic primary voters were interested the candidates discussing Medicare-for-all in the first primary debates. And, according to that same poll, voters showed a very poor understanding of what the term even means. In particular, they seemed to not understand that it implies transitioning away from private health insurance and towards a single-payer system. With Medicare’s key Hospital Fund, which finances Medicare services for beneficiaries through a payroll tax, set to go bankrupt by 2026 and states to start seeing Medicaid funds dry up by next year as they are no longer able to afford their share of care as the sheer numbers of those in need overwhelm the system, the crisis is looming—even if it’s not at the forefront of candidates’ minds. “You don’t want to be elected office at the time when those funds start to run out,” says Bob Kramer, founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care. “That will be a game of musical chairs which won’t be pretty.” Yet the cliff is still a few years away, and without immediate impetus, the debate remains focused on other issues. This, Kramer laments, is shortsighted. “The shorter the runway the tougher this will be to do, and the runway keeps getting shorter,” he says. Which is why, in part, states have begun to take up the slack. Hawaii and Washington State have become the first two states to pass long-term care plans of their own. Maine tried and failed last year, but will try again in 2020. Last year, Congress passed the RAISE Act, which promised to study the issue and look for solutions, but the CLASS Act, which would’ve started a similar scheme on a federal level fell out of the Affordable Care Act during the Senate debate, deemed too expensive. Still, the debate of Medicare-for-all could be productive, argues Anne Tumlinson, founder of Daughterhood, a blog and social platform for daughters caring for their parents, and a respected consultant in the senior space. ““There’s no reason that [long-term care] can’t be integrated into a Medicare-for-all program,” says Tumlinson. “It’s completely doable and there are many options to pay for it.” But, like with all legislation, seeing a reasonable end game doesn’t mean easy passage—especially though Congress in this political climate. “Long-term care is the hidden issue no one talks about. That’s because, while it affects nearly every family, it doesn’t affect them all at the same time,” Tumlinson says. “We don’t have a critical-enough mass of folks in this situation at the same time to elevate this pain politically, in my view.” Certainly, that was the case for Robinson. Senior care wasn’t her top issue until suddenly it needed to be. But the sad reality is that most families in America are heading to that inflection point sooner rather than later.","JUNE 26, 2019"

Doctors and Nurses Are Getting COVID-19 Burnout | Time,2131,"M
onths into the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases and hospitalizations surging across the country, health care workers are getting burned out mentally and physically. Sarah Flanagan, a Florida nurse who routinely treats COVID-19 patients, decided to cut back her hours and to switch to working part-time after feeling disheartened by the spread of false claims online about the pandemic. “I feel undervalued and disposable,” she says. She’s also worried about how little the health care system has rewarded front line workers. “Senior colleagues are telling me, ‘I want to leave the bedside, I feel exhausted and I don’t know what to do,'” she says. “It makes me afraid for the future.” Catherine Lazaro, a respiratory therapist in Washington state, treated one of the first U.S. COVID-19 patients. Over the course of the last nine months, as her hours increased and staff shortages became commonplace, she saw female colleagues leave their jobs, exhausted from the combined demands of child care and housework. Then, a dozen of her coworkers were furloughed. “I kept thinking, why we are in the middle of a respiratory pandemic, battling a respiratory virus, it doesn’t make any sense to furlough respiratory therapists,” she said. As she scrolled through message after message of desperate colleagues, she shared this message on social media: “From Heroes to Zeroes.” For others, their frustrations have been coupled with worries about bringing the virus home. Sarah Anderson, an OB/GYN in Colorado, decided to continue working and seeing patients while still breastfeeding her five-month-old daughter. “I hope that if I get it I’m creating the antibodies that will help protect [my baby] as well, but nobody really knows that.” She wears a mask at home to avoid exposing her other daughter, who’s five years old, and her husband. Still, Anderson can’t help but worry. “I’ve been talking with a lot of my colleagues about how the public is saying, ‘Thank you for being on the front lines’, they’re writing us thank-you notes and sending us pizza, ” she says. “We don’t need any of that. What we need is for you to stop exposing us.”","NOVEMBER 23, 2020"
The GOP's Daunting Path On Healthcare | Time,3522,"S
enate Republicans face a daunting path to getting a healthcare bill done in the next month, as is their stated goal, with the GOP’s seven-year pledge to repeal Obamacare facing its toughest test yet. Inducements designed to win conservative support appear to be having the desired effect, but efforts to win over moderates in the Senate are as yet not paying off. It’s unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even has the votes to begin debate on the legislation—which will be an all-important test vote for the bill. House Republicans have been told to be on standby for possible votes on the Senate bill if it passes. But the House and Senate bills differ substantially, and expecting swift passage of the Senate bill in the House would be premature, given how difficult it was to pass the bill there the first time around.
