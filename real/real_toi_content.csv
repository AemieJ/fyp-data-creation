Pandemic lessons: 'We need to look beyond clinical silos to value-based medicine',6611,"By Dr K Ellangovan
Healthcare services have never been a subject of intense debates and deliberations as seen now than any time in the recent past.

Covid-19 shook human conscience, deranged economies, disrupted life and exposed inadequacies in our healthcare system.
Millions have perished across the globe, perhaps in the worst pandemic of the century. Is it just that we were caught unprepared? Or are there fundamental issues in scaling up our healthcare services at short notice?

The reasons may be both. Our healthcare system just lacked the required resilience to withstand the virus onslaught. Human resources worked overtime, almost to the stage of collapse.
The supply chain broke down exposing serious glitches in the industry-hospital supply lines.
Countries across the globe suffered more or less, due to the mismatch of the healthcare system’s capacity with overwhelming patient turnout.
We have learnt lessons, bitter ones. There is an overwhelming demand for a relook at our healthcare system to understand its ability to manage pandemic situations.
The issues of scalability, accessibility and vulnerability are the focal points in the discussions.
When public health initiatives fail at the periphery, hospital load increases.
The pressure varies according to the disease load in the population and the transmission rate of the infection. A large turnout of patients deranges the care service in hospitals.
Our views on hospitals vary with experiences we undergo. Sometimes, we are happy with the services we received and yet, at times we criticize them, due to adverse outcomes.
Suspicion creeps into the doctor-patient relationship primarily due to huge asymmetry of information between them.
Hospitals and doctors are increasingly facing compensation suits and criminal cases, and this has altered the doctor-patient equation leading to a drastic change in the way treatment is administered in many hospitals.
Doctors resort to ‘defensive practice’, often ordering unnecessary investigations which ultimately inflates bills.
Any attempt to enforce accountability has met with resistance.
Doctors defend their actions and resent external scrutiny. Hospitals with a good process of care seldom face such situations.
Excellence in healthcare should address quality, cost and access---the three fundamental issues in healthcare.
Although public hospitals are deemed to deliver free service and medicines, in reality they do not. The need to use private diagnostic services and buy medicines on prescriptions creates a financial barrier in public hospitals for the poor.
The resistance to prescribe generic drugs adds up to medicine costs, and so do inappropriate use of antibiotics and the tendency to use newer branded molecules.
Unregulated pricing structure in private hospitals, in any case, has been a huge barrier for accessing services by the poor.
Physicians argue that the appropriateness of care process constitutes quality. Therefore, quality cannot be assessed by patients, who are not in a position to evaluate the services as interested parties and further, due to the lack of subject knowledge.
On the other side, patients contend that their experience is subsumed in the quality of services.
Therefore, clinical outcomes combined with patient experience should define the quality of services. Thus, there is no common ground as to what constitutes quality in healthcare.
So, most healthcare providers in the developed economies have embraced the practice of ‘evidence-based medicine’.
The clinical decisions are based on the evidence adduced through investigations and therefore are expected to be appropriate.
Indeed, in a way this was mandated by the private payer of service to standardize the care process, eliminate medical errors and regulate the outflow of funds.
Evidence-based medicine reiterates the physicians’ point of view in equating quality with the appropriateness of care but lacked the patients’ perspectives.
Therefore, of late, the concept of evidence-based medicine is increasingly replaced by ‘value-based medicine’.
It is essentially about the value that is created to the patients, in the course of the treatment process, and encompasses appropriateness of care, patient experience and the cost incurred for that experience.
It reflects the physicians’ and the patients’ perspectives. The need to embrace this approach became a necessity as part of achieving a patient's endorsement, an element that brings in a fair degree of accountability.
Accountability is generally low in publicly-funded institutions. Even in private clinics where service is met through out-of-pocket expenditures, owing to poor regulations there is a wide variation in the quality of service.
However, building too much accountability is seen to drive the cost upwards, as demonstrated in some developed economies.
Only if all hospitals develop a system approach to standardize the care process, define outcomes, measure the outcome, and publish them, not only will the credibility of the institution improve but even the resultant accumulation of new knowledge will certainly add to the quality of care.
If the patients’ experience is factored in, the service rendered will be valued by the patient community, leading to high levels of acceptance. Is it quite relevant to understand to what extent the delivery of services in publicly-funded hospitals match the expectations of the patients, the government, and the payer?
The answer to this question is dissatisfying and incites arguments and counter arguments. Indeed, most of us believe that public hospitals provide very basic healthcare service.
In the context of comorbidities forming the majority of caseloads in the population, an integrated medical service designed around the medical conditions is required. However, ground realities establish that healthcare services are provided from the ‘clinical silos’ created in the individual departments. Indeed, the care process is also fragmented and there is no process of care defined across the service departments.
The counter argument to this narrative is that these hospitals are perpetually overloaded and physician services are over-stretched.
This raises questions of whether there exists a need to design services in these hospitals around the medical conditions.
Whether it will create greater focus on developing expertise on specific illness is something that the policy makers have to ponder over.

Nashik ZP health staff under stress as NHM issue continues,1744,"Nashik: The healthcare workers in Nashik Zilla Parishad are feeling the strain of staff crunch as the stalemate over re-engaging the contractual workers under the National Health Mission continues.
As many as 706 employees were relieved by the ZP on August 1 on the instructions of the state government as the Centre had stopped financial support for payment of their salaries under the NHM.

After these contractual employees were relieved from the services, swab collection in the rural areas dropped significantly. The swab collection of around 7,000 a day has dropped to 4,000 a day. “These employees who were recruited exclusively for treating covid patients through the NHM have been relieved. The regular staff facing is problems in providing services to some extent. We are sure the government will find a way out soon,” said Rahul Hadpe of District Health Mission.
It may be noted that district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal pointed out that the staff should be hired immediately but the things have not changed.

District collector Suraj Madhare said that the administration was trying to figure out the way to foot the salary bill of around Rs 1.5 crore for all the employees through the district planning committee and the state disaster response fund.
“We have written to the state government seeking directions on the issue. We are hopeful that a solution will work out before the third wave of Covid hits us,” said Mandhare. The staff has also been trained in handling various equipment, including ventilators and oxygen apparatus besides other technical things. “They are an asset to us. These people have been trained to handle emergencies, ventilators and oxygen systems, along with pediatric care,” another officer said.

"BCCI to facilitate 30,000 RT-PCR tests during IPL 2nd phase, medical staff to stay in same bubble",2383,"DUBAI: The BCCI, along with its medical service provider VPS Healthcare, will facilitate the conduct of over 30,000 RT-PCR tests on all IPL players, support staff and other stakeholders during the remaining 31 games of the cash-rich league in the UAE.
In fact, the Dubai-based health care company is also in charge of emergency treatment of players, sports medicine experts and even air ambulance support during the tournament that starts on September 19.

To avoid players moving out of the IPL bio-bubble for any kind of medical emergency, the nursing and medical staff will be accommodated in the same hotel bio-bubbles.
The rescheduled IPL will have RT-PCR testing every third day, instead of every fifth day during the last edition in the UAE.

It is learnt that to cater to the needs of the players and other participants of the IPL, it has set up a 100-member multidisciplinary team for sports medicine and COVID-19 management.
Two medical teams comprising doctors, nurses, paramedics and laboratory technicians will be assigned to each stadium for every match.
Ahead of the arrival of the players, VPS Healthcare completed testing for over 750 hotel staff across 14 hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
On August 13, it started testing the players of the Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings teams. With the updated protocol requiring players and officials to get tested once every three days, the healthcare provider anticipates over 30,000 PCR tests this year.
It has the capacity to conduct 2,000 PCR tests for the IPL each day, with a turnaround time of 6-8 hours. Moreover, to ensure secure bio-bubbles, nurses and other medical staff are accommodated in the same 14 hotels as the players till the end of the tournament.
Dr. Shajir Gaffar, CEO of VPS Healthcare (Dubai and Northern Emirates), said, ""Our team is completely equipped to take care of the medical needs of the IPL participants.
""The UAE has a good strike rate in seamlessly conducting high-profile sports events during the pandemic. Even in these challenging times, the country is setting new benchmarks in expertly managing international sporting tournaments through its state-of-the art stadiums, watertight measures, and well-trained personnel.
""With the second leg of the IPL and ICC T20 World Cup happening back-to-back, the UAE can solidify its pioneering position as a safe global sporting destination.""

BCCI reappoints NRI-led healthcare group as medical partner for IPL matches,3217,"With the rescheduled Indian Premier League (IPL) matches set to be held between September 19 and October 15 in the United Arab Emirates, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has renewed its association with VPS Healthcare; one of the largest healthcare providers in the country, founded by Dr Shamsheer Vayalil, a non-resident Indian from Kerala.
For the second consecutive year, the UAE-based group will be the healthcare partner for the IPL tournament, monitoring Covid-19 RT-PCR testing. The tournament will take place over 31 matches across Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Dubai with an updated testing protocol requiring more COVID19 tests than last year. Each player will have to undergo testing once in three days with the first test at the airport and then testing on 2,4,6 days in the week. This will be followed by testing on every third day until the tournament ends. Last year, the protocol was the first test at the airport and then testing on 3,5,7 days in the first week. Then testing was required every five days until the tournament was over.

To ensure a safe IPL experience, VPS Healthcare has made elaborate arrangements in all its hospitals across the Emirates, according to a press release from the company. As the official medical partner, the group will be responsible for providing a broad range of services including emergency medical services, sports medicine support, musculoskeletal imaging, specialist teleconsultation, doctor-on-call, and ambulance/air ambulance support. To cater to the needs of the players and other participants of the IPL, it has set up a 100-member multidisciplinary team for sports medicine and Covid-19 management. Two medical teams comprising doctors, nurses, paramedics and lab technicians will be assigned to each stadium for every match.
""Last year, during the IPL 2020 tournament, we conducted around 44,000 COVID19 tests successfully having worked with the players and other BCCI stakeholders. This year too, our team is committed to following the strictest standard operating procedure to ensure a safe environment with the staff at the hotels and our own staff following the same protocol as the IPL players and as part of the same bio-bubble. We have successfully provided these services for other big sporting events too and have been following the best standard operating procedures globally,"" Dr Shajir Gaffar, CEO of VPS Healthcare (Dubai and Northern Emirates), told Timesofindia.com.

He added that the UAE has a good strike rate in seamlessly conducting high-profile sports events during the pandemic, with the second leg of the IPL and ICC T20 World Cup scheduled back-to-back. ""The UAE is in a pioneering position as a safe global sporting destination with the highest standards of following protocols, testing and contact tracing being implemented. Besides, 90% of the population in the UAE is fully vaccinated.""
During the 2020 IPL season, VPS Healthcare handled 80 hospital visits and facilitated the treatment of 156 injuries across its hospitals. The group also offered Covid-related services for other international sporting events including the UAE Cycling Tour, AFC Champions League group stage matches, T10, UFK, and UAE Warriors.

Every fourth eligible person in Delhi is now fully vaccinated; North West district leads chart,2990,"NEW DELHI: With Covid vaccination picking up pace in the city, the number of people getting the second dose and completing the inoculation cycle is rapidly going up. More than 41 lakh of the approximate 1.5 crore eligible population in Delhi, or every fourth eligible citizen, is now fully vaccinated.
Till 6pm on Monday, 1,42,66,435 vaccine doses had been administered in Delhi, including 1,01,49,595 as first dose and 41,16,840 as second. This means that 67.7% of all eligible Delhiites have received at least one jab, while 27.4% are now fully vaccinated.



As with the overall vaccination programme, it is once again the youth leading those getting the second dose. Although the approximately 92 lakh individuals in the 18-44 age bracket were the last to become eligible for inoculation from May 3, they have already received more than 81 lakh, or nearly 57%, of the vaccine doses administered till 6pm on Monday.

The age breakup of vaccine doses administered till Sunday, shows 58 lakh people in the 18-44 age group have received at least one jab, with more than 12.5 lakh having got both. In comparison, the individuals aged 45 years or above and who have received at least one dose number nearly 35.3 lakh, including 22.4 lakh who are now fully vaccinated. This is apart from the 2.2 lakh healthcare workers and 3.5 lakh frontline workers who have received both the doses.
As the government vaccination sites are closed on Sundays, only 2,291 first dose and 6,062 second ones were administered. In the latter group, 5,036 were in the 18-44 age bracket and 971 were aged 45 and above, apart from 55 healthcare and frontline workers.
In a similar way, Saturday saw 16,007 individuals aged 45 years and above receiving the second dose, while those in the 18-44 category far outnumbered them at 47,256. Friday saw 12,977 of the former and 32,710 of the latter being administered the second dose, while the figures for Thursday were, respectively, 14,351 and 30,883.
When comparing the total number of doses administered, those aged 60 years and above account for 21,68,684, which is 15.2% of all vaccines administered in Delhi till date. Those in the 45-59 years category have received 39,78,473 doses, which is nearly 27.8% of all doses administered.
The youth has been the wheel of the vaccination drive in Delhi, in spite of not only becoming eligible later but the inoculation drive for this age group being halted a few times in May and June due to vaccine shortage and when people eligible for their second vaccine dose were given the priority.
Taking the total numbers into account, North-West district has administered the highest number of both the first (12,31,105) and second doses (4,77,474) among the 11 districts of the capital. It is followed by South West (4,69,849) and West (4,66,685) districts when it comes to citizens who are now fully vaccinated. In contrast, North-East district logged the least number of second doses of vaccine being administered at 2,04,977.

High courts were bastions of ensuring justice during Covid-19: Supreme Court,1603,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday while dismissing an appeal by the Manipur government, observed that High Courts were bastions of ensuring that justice was dispensed during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The court said this while dismissing an appeal filed by the Manipur government challenging the high court's order directing the state to frame exhaustive rules for combating Covid-19.

A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli also remarked on the pathetic condition of quarantine centres maintained by the State.
Dismissing the appeal of the Manipur government, the Bench said that the high court was absolutely justified in passing the directions.

""Our high courts were bastions of ensuring that justice was done during the Covid-19 pandemic... Your standard quarantine centres were pathetic. There were no separate washrooms for male and female. Healthcare workers did not change the beddings regularly. The high court has passed a calibrated order. We are not going to give you a character certificate,"" said the apex court.
The Manipur government had approached the top court challenging the Manipur high court's July 16, 2020 order which had directed the State government to constitute a committee of experts that may advise the government as to the course of action that may be adopted to prevent the spread of Covid-19, after holding regular deliberations with all the stakeholders.
The high court had observed that even though the state government had been trying its best level to contain the pandemic, there was no information regarding the same in the public domain.

All healthcare staff in Lucknow given at least 1 shot,2109,"LUCKNOW: Eight months since the start of the mass immunisation campaign in January, the health department in Lucknow has now been able to inoculate almost the entire healthcare community with at least a shot of the vaccine, while 78% have been fully vaccinated.
The target was to fully vaccinate all healthcare workers in Lucknow by March this year. There are about 79,000 healthcare workers in various government and private medical facilities. Of these 40% are women.


TIMESVIEW

Healthcare workers have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid pandemic. They have a dual responsibility of protecting themselves and the public. For this, they need to set an example for the general public by getting themselves fully vaccinated and follow covid appropriate behaviour.





The vaccination of the healthcare staff started on January 16.
However, according to data available at the chief medical officer’s office, till date, 78,509 (99.3%) have received at least a vaccine shot.
A further break-up shows that 62,267 (78.8%) have completed the two-dose course, while around 16,242 beneficiaries have taken a dose and are waiting for the gap period to end to take the second. CMO spokesperson Yogesh Raghuvanshi said that almost all the healthcare workers have been vaccinated and most of those still left are ineligible because of certain health issues.
The delay in vaccination of healthcare workers was caused because many employees of private hospitals did not register themselves initially. Later, new recruitments and those transferred to Lucknow from other districts were added. The final count reached 79,000 in July.
Experts opined that the health department should push the drive further and inoculate healthcare workers waiting for a second dose as early as possible.
Former head of the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences-BHU, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, said, “Full vaccination will provide healthcare workers protection while tackling the probable third Covid-19 wave.” However, he added, healthcare workers will have to continue to follow Covid protocols even after being fully vaccinated.
"
Many healthcare and frontline workers have not gone for 2nd dose,2116,"Ludhiana: About 37% of those who had received the first dose have turned up for the second to become fully vaccinated. A substantial number of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) hasn’t got the second dose. The vaccination for HCWs had started on January 16 and for frontline workers (FLW) on February 3. Ludhiana had recently crossed the two-million vaccination target.
The health department data of Thursday evening shows that 21,12,648 vaccinations have been carried out. As many as 15,46,899 have received the first dose and 5,65,749 (36.6%) of them are fully vaccinated.

While 33,258 HCWs have got the first dose of vaccine, 23,267 (69.9%) have received the second.
Of 1,09,959 FLWs—who comprise police, revenue department, municipal workers, among others—31,611 (28.75%) have received the second dose so far. Till May 10—when the gap between two vaccines was six to eight weeks, which the Centre increased to at least 84 days in mid-month—21,086 FLWs (27.6%) had received the second dose and 76,278 the first. This indicates that a large number of them hasn’t got their second dose of vaccine.

Till May 10, of the 31,569 HCWs, 21,580 (68.4%) had received the second jab.
As per the data of March 20, when the gap between two doses was four to six weeks, of the 15,589 FLWs who had got the first dose, 3,193 had got the second, which was 20.48%. And of the 25,539 HCWs, 15,884 had got the second dose.
A health department official said, “Since the government announced a gap of 84 days, a large number of persons is yet to get the second dose. A number of HCWs and FLWs haven’t got the second dose and have been asked to receive it.”
District immunization officer Dr Puneet Juneja was not available for comments.
“I think the HCWs and FLWs who haven’t got the second dose feel there is no need for it as Covid cases are declining. It is important for the eligible persons to get both the doses to protect themselves from the disease. A single dose will not help achieve it. The authorities must motivate people to get both the doses,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati.

Maharashtra: Healthcare staff vax volume low,413,"Vaccination volume among healthcare and frontline workers (HCWs & FLWs) in Thane is still low even as the city administered 10 lakh jabs till Wednesday, officials said.
While 7.18 lakh residents took the first jab, 2.8 lakh have been fully vaccinated. TMC data shows 15,782 (49% of target volume of 32,017 HCWs) took the second dose till September 1. In Mumbai, over 1.12 lakh of them are awaiting their 2nd dose."
"More than 90% frontline workers, 80% healthcare staffers got first jab in PMR",1598,"Pune: Over 90% frontline workers and 80% healthcare staffers have received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the Pune Metropolitan region, hinting at people in both the segments having overcome the initial apprehension about vaccination.
According to the district health office data, a total of 2.55 lakh frontline workers have received their first dose as against 1.56 lakh healthcare workers. As many as 1.84 lakh frontline workers (65%) and 1.2 lakh healthcare workers (74%) have received both the doses in the region.

The data showed that there were 1.98 lakh beneficiaries in the healthcare workers’ category and around 2.84 lakh frontline workers in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).
Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The vaccination figures for healthcare and frontline workers show that we have covered a lot of ground in terms of vaccine awareness among the Covid warriors. We are now focusing on the completion of the second dose of these beneficiaries via reminders to them.”

When asked if 100% vaccination of these categories would be possible, Deshmukh said there was a possibility if the healthcare and frontline workers got vaccinated from the general citizens’ category.
Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India of the Indian Medical Association, said, “Initially, there were a lot of issues with the registration process when the vaccination process started on January 16. Many medical experts got vaccinated from the general citizen category. We had offered our premises for vaccination, but did not get a favourable response.”

Andhra Pradesh: Man dies after taking Covid vaccine in Krishna district,1856,"VIJAYAWADA: A 30-year-old mason died a few hours after taking a Covid-19 vaccine shot at Marlapalem in Krishna district on Tuesday night. The deceased, identified as SK Subhani, was administered a vaccine shot at Mustabada primary health centre during Tuesday’s mega vaccination drive in the district.
His family members said he didn’t feel any symptoms till 9 pm, but his condition deteriorated after dinner. He developed high fever, started vomiting, and also suffered from diarrhoea the whole night. He died before he could be shifted to Gannavaram hospital.



While his relatives blamed the side-effects of the vaccine for his death, health officials said he died of other complications. “We have administered a total of 37,000 doses till date without any issues. Subhani got the vaccine on Tuesday and he was kept under observation for 30 minutes. He was sent home after he didn’t exhibit any symptoms. He was alcoholic and suffered from many other complications. We cannot confirm the exact reason behind his death at this stage, but it’s definitely not due to vaccine,” Dr J Sandhya, health officer at Mustabadha PHC, told TOI.

Subhani’s wife died eight months ago. He is survived by a six-month old son. Gannavaram police have registered a suspicious death case .
Till date, a total of nine vaccine-related deaths have been reported across the state as per health department data. But no single death has been confirmed to have been caused by the vaccine. The state government announced an ex-gratia of 50 lakh to the family members of Asha worker B Vijaya Lakshmi from Guntur who died in January due to heart stroke after taking her vaccine shot. Healthcare workers have been directed to closely monitor the vaccinated person for 30 minutes and check for any side-effects or symptoms before he or she is allowed to leave the vaccination centre.

1 in 5 healthcare workers yet to receive second Covid vaccine shot,3100,"NEW DELHI: Healthcare workers and frontline workers were the very first priority groups identified when Covid vaccination started in mid-January, but more than seven months on, nearly one in five healthcare workers and over a quarter of frontline workers have not yet got their second shots, official data shows. A closer look shows widely differing coverage levels in states with Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Delhi having the lowest coverage.
Nationally, just over 1.03 crore healthcare workers have got the first shot, but under 84 lakh have got the second. Among frontline workers, while 1.83 crore have got their first shot, only 1.32 crore have got the second.



Almost all states have achieved over 95% coverage of the first dose in both groups, barring Punjab, Karnataka and Delhi. Among the larger states, Kerala, Haryana and Jharkhand had the best record with complete or near total coverage of first dose in both groups and over 85% coverage with the second shot.

In contrast, in Tamil Nadu barely 60% of healthcare workers and 40% of frontline workers have received the second dose.
""There was vaccine hesitancy and wastage in the first four months of the drive. With this, the allotment came down. Although allotments have increased, we still have a lot of backlog to clear. This can be set right only if we have on time allocation of 1 crore doses,"" said Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan.
Surprisingly, Himachal Pradesh, which has been in the news for the highest overall Covid vaccination coverage in the country, had the lowest proportion of frontline workers who got the second dose, just 38% of the total 5.8 lakh registered. State health authorities said the gap between coverage of first and second dose was because of the waiting period between doses being increased. Similarly, barely 50% of frontline workers in Karnataka and 57% in Delhi have got the second shot.
In some states, even the coverage of first dose was very poor among these priority groups. Punjab officials, where only 61% of healthcare workers have got their first dose, blame vaccine shortage but also claim that they don’t have full data after those in the 18-44 age group, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, started getting their doses in the private sector. In Delhi just 87% of healthcare workers have got their first dose.
Officials in Karnataka, where the proportion of healthcare workers who received the first dose was just 85%, claim they have problems with duplicate entries in the Cowin database of registered HCWs making the total numbers inflated. They claim that this is because doctors who are visiting consultants in many hospitals have been registered by various hospitals and nursing students who were graduating were registered by their colleges.
Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat and Assam have ensured high coverage of first and second dose among both priority groups. Although a smaller state, Goa too has a good record, having ensured 90% plus coverage for second shots in both groups.

Breakthrough Covid-19 infections found in 25% healthcare staff: Study,2030,"NEW DELHI: A little more than 25 per cent of healthcare workers were infected with coronavirus despite getting fully jabbed, a recent study has revealed, giving an insight on the breakthrough infections due to the Delta variant.
The study, jointly conducted by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and Max hospitals in Delhi-NCR, found that vaccination breakthroughs were far more common during the Delta-outbreak in Delhi than previously reported.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

However, the severity of the infection was low and vaccination is crucial to avoid severe illnesses, said Shantanu Sengupta, senior scientist with the IGIB and one of the lead researchers of the study.
He also cautioned that of the 25 per cent who were infected, a large number were asymptomatic, so masking is also very important to arrest the spread of infection.

Sengupta said nearly 95 healthcare workers who had taken the two doses were studied. They were assessed from 45-90 days after their inoculation. Of the 95, more than 25 per cent saw breakthrough infections.
""Immunisation is expected to confer protection against infection and severe disease for vaccines, while reducing risks to non-immunised population by inhibiting transmission. Here, based on serial serological studies, we show that during a severe SARS-CoV2 Delta-variant outbreak in Delhi, 25.3 per cent of previously uninfected, ChAdOx1-nCoV19 (Covishield) double vaccinated, healthcare-workers (HCW) were infected within a period of less than two months, based on serology,"" the study said.
Most infections were unrecognised. The Delta- variant thus causes frequent unrecognised breakthrough infections in adequately immunised subjects, reducing any herd-effect of immunity, and requiring reinstatement of preventive measures such as masking, the paper said.
There is a need to have a variant-specific high throughput neutralisation assay to truly assess population immunity and predict outbreak risk, it said.

Village health centres hit by lack of officers to run them,1734,"GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Only 42 of the 76 health sub-centres planned in Ghaziabad are currently functional because there aren’t enought community health officers (CHOs). In Noida, there are 61 health and wellness centres, including 35 at the sub-centre level, and of these, 26 do not have CHOs.
These sub-centres are the first healthcare points in villages and family planning drives, counselling sessions, routine immunisation programmes and ante-natal check-ups are planned at these facilities. Some centres also conduct procedures like insertion of copper IUDs, as part of the family planning drive.

The government had planned to upgrade the sub-centres that focused on maternal and child healthcare to health and wellness centres and in Ghaziabad, the target was to increase the number of such facilities to 76 by 2020-21 fiscal. But only 42 are operational.
Chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, said usually, one CHO is posted in each facility. In the first week of August, the CMO had written a letter to the director of the National Health Mission (NHM) seeking appointment of CHOs for the 34 centres. But a response is awaited.

Officials in Noida also said that regular requests are made to the state officials about CHO postings.
“We have 23 new health and wellness centres that need CHOs. Additionally, there are three centres where the CHO posts have been lying vacant since early last year,” said Manjeet Singh, district program manager, NMH, Gautam Budh Nagar. He added that there are also about 128 sub-centres that are being managed by local-level healthcare workers.
Under the NHM, healthcare workers get a six-month bridge course following which they appear for exams before getting selected as CHOs.

Covid concerns loom as Maharashtra festival season starts on Monday,3925,"MUMBAI: Ahead of the festival season, which begins on Monday with Janmashtami, a sense of deja vu has gripped the city’s public healthcare experts and doctors.
It was in September 2020 that the worst peak of the first wave began just days after Ganpati Bappa bid adieu to the city in the last week of August. The fortnight before the Ganpati festival, in the third week of August in 2020, the state had registered 1.7 lakh Covid cases, while the fortnight after the festival added 2.5 lakh cases -- a jump of nearly 50%.



A year later, the decline in the Covid second wave has led to easing of most Covid-19-related norms, which has led to a slight rise in daily cases in the city for the last four consecutive days: after almost two weeks of registering less than 300 cases daily, the BMC registered 391 cases on Saturday, and 362, 398 and 342 cases on the previous days. However, the total cases added in the state and the city since the opening up has not been significant. The state added over 81,000 cases in the first 14 days of August, which has dipped to 64,401 from August 15 to 28, while the number of cases in the city has been almost the same at around 4,000.

New Covid cases remain under 5,000 in Maharashtra and 400 in Mumbai amid uptick

The number of Covid-19 cases detected in the state and city increased slightly on Saturday. The state continued to add under 5,000 cases, while the city added nearly 400 cases.


The fear of the third wave has led the Central health ministry to issue a directive to states to keep a tight check during the festive season, which begins with Janmasthami on Monday and continues with the Jain festival Paryushan (September 3 to 10) and Ganpati (September 10 to 19) till Diwali on November 4.
Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday yet again appealed to people to ensure that the health of the people is prioritised over festivities. “The state has already issued advisories regarding the protocols to be followed during the festive season. The threat of Covid-19 is still there and so all political, social and religious groups must follow government-issued norms,” said Thackeray in response to the Centre’s advisory. The state government has downsized the festivals even this year, cancelled dahi handi events, and is yet to open up religious places officially.

Centre tells Maharashtra govt to consider local curbs in festive season

Even as Maharashtra and Mumbai reported a slight decline in daily cases on Friday, the Centre asked the state government to consider imposing local restrictions on mass events and public gatherings during the upcoming festive season to prevent the spread of Covid-19.


A doctor pointed out that the easing of restrictions has been to a “higher degree” this time around as compared to September 2020: more people have approval for train travel and there is no restriction on intra-city or district travel. However, a senior state government official said that the key difference between this year and last year is that the vaccine coverage in Mumbai has been significant and it is likely that it will help keep the cases low.

Mumbai: Third Covid wave not expected to be as big as second, says BMC

The third Covid-19 wave is imminent and could begin as early as next month, coinciding with the festive season, according to BMC officials. The silver lining, though, is the third wave may not be as “big” as the second when the number of active Covid-19 cases had touched 91,000 in April, said BMC


But BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare isn’t perturbed. She said the four-day rise is very slight and could be linked to the unlocking. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, said that the trend should be watched for a few days before an alarm is raised. “A slight increase due to unlocking is expected. The testing positivity rate is around 1%, and that is good,” he said.

‘Nagpur close to being all-round medical hub’,2305,"NAGPUR: Healthcare is a major sector which needs investment. Today, because of the expertise of doctors and their capacity to take right decisions, we are day-by-day improving in the health sector, said Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday while stating that “Nagpur is very close to being an all-round medical hub”.
Gadkari was speaking at the launch of Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and Heart Transplant Programme started by Viveka Hospitals in collaboration with MGM Healthcare, Chennai.

The city MP said that organ transplantation set-ups are very important in the current scenario. “I wish we had more equipment during the crucial Covid waves so that we could have saved many lives. Viveka has done an excellent job in setting up this heart transplant clinic,” he said.
The minister hoped that in the days to come, there will be facilities for other organ transplants too. “This collaboration will be highly rewarding for the Nagpur city and citizens of the neighbouring states too, as people will not need have to travel to different places for transplant surgery,” he said.

Dr KR Balakrishnan, director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, MGM Healthcare, Chennai, said, “Organ transplantation is not an easy task. There are many challenges. Several times delays in commute cost patients their life. It is good to see Nagpur evolving in terms of medical sciences. Every state must have at least one major public hospital with all the necessary facilities for those who cannot afford treatment a private hospital.”
Dr Suresh Rao KG, co-director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and mechanical circulatory support, department of cardiac anesthesia, MGM Healthcare, and Dr R Ravikumar, senior consultant and associate clinical lead-cardiology and heart failure programme, MGM, were the guests of honour.
Dr Mukund Thakare, director of Viveka Hospital, were present, Dr KG Jayaprasanna, senior consultant cardiothoracic and vascular surgery at Viveka Hospital, Dr Prashant Jagtap, senior consultant cardiologist, Viveka Hospital, Dr Nilesh Mathankar, Dr Abhijeet Deshmukh and other dignitaries from Viveka and MGM were present.
The programme was conducted and coordinated by Dr Nikhil Balankhe and the vote of thanks was proposed by Dr Ajay Sakhare.

"Reopen schools in Delhi but tread with caution, say experts",4697,"NEW DELHI: Medical experts on Friday welcomed the Delhi government's decision to reopen schools, colleges and coaching institutes in the national capital but advised parents to tread with caution by teaching Covid protocols to children.
Following a marked improvement in the Covid-19 situation here, the Delhi government on Friday announced that schools for classes 9 to 12, colleges and coaching institutions will reopen from September 1.

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said teaching and learning activities will continue to be conducted in a blended mode.
Dr Rahul Nagpal, Director, Pediatrics and Neonatology at Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj said schools have to open in a staggered manner with proper guidelines in place.

""What I am seeing is that children are completely lost and we have to look at their mental faculties. Children have to be educated about the new normal by parents.
""As for schools, they have to ensure proper ventilation in classrooms which is a problem and they might go for hybrid education, some of it might be offline and online,"" Nagpal told PTI.
He added that schools will have to form SoPs for entry and exit of students and make vaccination of staffers mandatory.
Dr Sarita Sharma of PSRI Hospital said it is mandatory to immunise the staff against Covid-19 before opening schools.
""We don't have any vaccines against Covid-19 for children available in India as of now but after taking proper precautions and ensuring coronavirus-appropriate behaviour, schools can be reopened.
""All the teachers, caregivers, ancillary staff of schools should be fully immunised against Covid before opening schools,"" the senior paediatric consultant said.
Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.
While several states started partial reopening of schools from October last year, the Delhi government allowed reopening in January only for classes 9 to 12.
However, schools were again completely shut in April following an aggressive second wave of Covid-19.
According to Dr (Maj) Manish Mannan, HOD - Paediatrics and Neonatology at Paras Healthcare, the side effects of isolation in children are far severe than that of Covid infection.
""Mental illnesses, obesity, aggressive behaviour, sleep disorders and other cognitive problems have been rising at an alarming rate which has been going unnoticed. The physical exercises, the brain quiz classes have gone missing during the last year, even after parents tried their best to meet the needs,"" Mannan said.
He noted that interaction and involvement that are only possible in a classroom are a ""great source of learning which has gone missing"".
""ICMR stated that kids have a better metabolism to handle viruses, and I believe that too by taking care of their health and nutrition we should allow kids to go to school. It's good for their mental as well as physical wellbeing,"" Mannan added.
While Sisodia on Friday said no final decision has been taken regarding junior classes and a call will be taken after analysing the effect of reopening schools for senior classes, sources indicated that schools for classes 6 to 8 may reopen from September 8.
Although the smaller children may not be severely affected by Covid-19, Dr Gauri Agarwal of Seeds of Innocence said they may become carriers and affect people at home.
""Opening schools may be a good idea for young adults/teenagers as they will be more careful about following Covid protocols.
""With smaller children, we have seen that though they are not vulnerable to severe disease, they can become carriers of the virus that can affect people at home -- especially the elderly, the unwell and the pregnant women,"" Agarwal said.
She suggested that it was important to teach Covid protocols to children but should not expect them to be able to follow them perfectly.
""So, probably it would be better to wait before we open primary and lower sections of the schools,"" she added.
Dr Vikramjeet Singh, Consultant-Internal Medicine, Aakash Healthcare said access to school for younger children must be carefully planned as staying away from natural, socialising environments for a prolonged time may affect their social skills and mental health.
""Schools may plan supervised, restricted and staggered physical meetings for children in lower sections to ensure Covid protocols are maintained.
""With the extent of discussions around Covid protocols, older children may be able to follow social distancing norms and other measures. So, allowing them staggered access to the classroom should be fine. Some schools in Gurgaon have already experimented with this idea,"" he said.

Maharashtra: ‘Healthcare in rural hospitals suffered due to manpower shortage in pandemic’,2301,"MUMBAI: Twenty-two out of 38 rural hospitals and sub-district hospitals in rural Maharashtra didn’t perform the Caesarean section for childbirth since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Routine surgeries, including trauma, cataract and family planning procedures, were unavailable in a sizeable number of public hospitals in 17 districts, according to a survey conducted by a network of health NGOs.


“The need for public health facilities increased during the Covid period as people from various socio-economic sections required public services for treatment and vaccination. However, due to major shortfalls in the public system, especially in rural areas, the poor were forced to go to private hospitals,” said Shauilaja Aralkar of the Jan Arogya Abhiyan, which conducted the survey.
“Our survey found that health workers toiled, but the under-resourced health system faltered,” said JAA’s Girish Bhave.

The survey, which was conducted by JAA volunteers in July, also found a crippling shortage of manpower in the public healthcare system. “There is only one permanent medical officer in half (51%) of the PHCs. This means only one regular doctor for an over 30,000 population, while the WHO norm is one doctor for a 1,000 population,” said Bhave.
Only half of the primary healthcare centres have permanent nurses. There is almost a 50% vacancy in the posts of specialist doctors in rural hospitals. “General surgeons were available in only 25% of these hospitals while anesthetists were available in only 35% of them,” the survey added.
The districts covered included Thane, Palghar, Pune, Akola, Amravati, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nandurbar, Parbhani, Beed, Yavatmal, Solapur and Hingoli.
Nandurbar and Gadchiroli had the worst parameters, they said.
One of the most serious findings is that there is no regular second medical officer in 49% of primary healthcare centres. While contractual doctors were called in, in 25% PHCs the post of second medical officer is vacant. “A single regular medical officer is being required to manage the PHC and cover a population of over 30,000 people, while performing outreach Covid as well as official record keeping and meetings. This has led to closed OPDs and has affected routine immunisation,” the survey found.

"Those who have ‘packet milk’ won’t find gold in it, says Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh",2457,"KOLKATA: Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh rekindled the gold-in-cow’s-milk debate on Friday, saying that people in and around Kolkata — used to having “packet milk” — could not possibly find gold in the product.
Cattle-rearing was rare in and around Kolkata, Ghosh said at a BJP peasants’ wing meeting at the party’s Hastings headquarters in the city. “Why should everyone go in for only farming?” he asked, suggesting dairy as an alternative before wading into his gold-in-milk theory.

“I had earlier said milk contained gold but many people criticised me for that statement,” he said on Friday. “But how will people, who have not consumed real milk and have had only packet milk, find gold in it?” he asked. “People in Bengal have stopped drinking cow’s milk. They prefer liquor tea (over milk tea),” he rued.



Healthcare experts and the city’s academia, however, failed to find anything of value in the state BJP chief’s dogged pursuit of gold in milk. “I have not come across any evidence that cow’s milk contains traces of the metal,” IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar said. “The Indian Council of Medical Research should look into the matter if these claims are made repeatedly and settle the issue once and for all,” he added.
Sociologist and Presidency emeritus professor Prasanta Ray said proponents of such theories might want to “indicate to their supporters that they are rooted in tradition”.
“The cow is a symbol of ancient sacred tradition,” he said, adding: “Those who propagate such theories want to indicate that they are rooted in those traditions. That gives a kind of legitimacy to their brand of politics. They want us to believe that their ways are more indigenous and better than that of others. They want to assert that they are showing a sacred way and are on a moral high,” sociologist Prasanta Ray said
The best way to resolve such issues, Ray said, was to go to the laboratory and get the claims validated.
Ghosh later tried to explain that he meant to use the word “gold” as a “metaphor”. “Farmers are not getting a good price for their produce. Focusing on animal husbandry may get them better returns. They can also look at high-yield cattle breeds. That was what I meant when I spoke about gold in milk,” Ghosh said.
“Besides, milk’s nutritional value cannot be any less than that of gold. I don’t care what critics say. Those who have not had cow’s milk will not understand whether there is gold or silver in it,” he added.

"No rest till all eligible persons get vaccinated, says President Ram Nath Kovind",2267,"LUCKNOW: Stating that the battle against coronavirus pandemic was far from over, President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday lauded the country’s vaccination programme while stressing that there was no time for rest till every eligible person in the country is vaccinated.
Speaking at the 26th annual convocation of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, he said: “with the collective efforts of our doctors, healthcare workers and administrators, the nation has been conducting the world’s largest vaccination drive. We have made incredible progress with more than 61 crore citizens successfully vaccinated across the country. In Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of the country, nearly 6.7 crore people have been vaccinated so far. I appreciate the efforts of all those who are contributing to this great mission.”

He added that the nation should remain grateful to all doctors, nurses, medical students, healthcare and sanitation workers and administrators who served fellow citizens while risking their lives and rose to the occasion of crisis. He also lauded the role of SGPGI in Covid-19 control while appreciating the support provided by the UP government.
Stating that buildings and facilities alone do not make a world class institute, he told the awardees and degree holders that the human element in health care was indispensable. “More important than method and technology is the human element, that is, the healer (in you). You have acquired great skills and knowledge; now is the time to put them to use in serving others. For the patient, hoping for relief and recovery, you are nothing less than an angel. Their faith in you is a great responsibility for you,” he said.

Defining the vision for SGPGI, the President said: “Many eminent personalities have worked hard to make SGPGI a premier institute. Now is the time to expand your influence. I am told that the chief minister has announced the setting up of medical colleges in every district. It is incumbent upon you to extend your expertise to all these upcoming institutes so that they can be developed as centres of excellence in their own way. This will help people get best treatment within the state which will eventually emerge as a preferred destination for healthcare.”

Attacks on healthcare workers: Kerala HC orders govt to act swiftly,1626,"KOCHI: The state government and police should ensure that attacks on doctors, nurses, and other health workers are not repeated in the state and that swift action is taken if it happens, the Kerala high court has ordered.
The order was issued by a division bench comprising justices Devan Ramachandran and Kauser Edappagath while considering a review petition (RP No. 379/2021) on the issue of Covid-19 treatment rates in private hospitals.

In the order, the court said it would be impossible to reign in the Covid-19 pandemic and other related diseases unless the healthcare sector is allowed to function peacefully and with the autonomy that it requires.
“The Doctors, Nurses and other health care providers are certainly the most vital and valuable in the health care system, particularly the women who courageously discharge their duties and sometimes act even beyond the call of their duty. We are, therefore, without doubt that the Government and other stakeholders, including the district collectors and the district superintendents of police must now ensure that such events and instances do not happen in future and that quick and swift action is taken if any such report is made,’ the order stated.

An order was issued by the court after Indian Medical Association (IMA) informed the court that sporadic instances of attacks are happening and they have made doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers extremely vulnerable, particularly when emergency rooms are often manned by women during nights.
If this situation continues, it might become difficult for the health sector to function properly, the court was told.

Why Kerala failed to flatten the curve: Experts cite multiple factors,4565,"KOCHI: Kerala is in the national spotlight once again, with the state accounting for 68% of 46,265 new Covid-19 cases in India on Wednesday. It has also revived a debate on the Kerala model of Covid management, as cases continue to surge here amid lockdown relaxations while the other states that lifted restrictions much earlier reported only 14,820 of these cases.
Healthcare experts said there are multiple factors for the situation, like how many susceptible people are there, how many of them are vaccinated, how are they behaving and what is their living condition and travel pattern.



“The epidemiological triangle of agent, host and environment is also pertinent here, with the virus being the agent and people host. An environment or the weather factor that allows droplets to stay in the atmosphere for a longer period is also important. We must also bear in mind that not all facts about this virus are known; there could be some unknown contributing elements as well,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, research cell, Kerala State Indian Medical Association.

In the second wave, the state had its peak in mid-May with over 40,000 daily cases and TPR touching 28% but the healthcare system withstood it. The state has been on a higher plateau of 16,000-18,000 daily cases and a sustained TPR of around 11-12% since then. The cases are peaking again now, after Onam.


Kerala has about 50% of its population still susceptible to the novel coronavirus as against about 30% across India. The state's strategy of flattening the curve ensured that its healthcare infrastructure has not collapsed but the vulnerable population as a percentage of the total population is clearly much higher in Kerala.
“The virus is very much active in the state and we still have a large vulnerable population... Quick vaccination and strict enforcement of existing rules is the key to controlling the spread of the infection and reducing fatalities. When compared to the other states, majority of people wear masks and use sanitisers here on a regular basis. However, people also need to ensure social distancing and avoid unnecessary travel and social functions,” Kerala Government Medical Officer's Association president Dr G S Vijayakrishnan said.


Testing, contact tracing and isolation in a scientific manner — the key to controlling infection in the first wave — have drastically come down. The state has promised to increase testing, which has come down from 2 lakh tests/day to less than 1.5 lakh tests/day, but experts believe it is too late now.
“An aggressive testing strategy was good till we were testing, contact tracing and isolating patients but that is not happening now. We have now reached a stage where it is meaningless to increase testing. The other states could also be not testing enough,” said Dr A Sukumaran, former state epidemiologist who has come out of retirement to work at the Wayanad Covid control room.
Vaccination has, however, helped the vulnerable population. “It (vaccination) might not have helped control the spread but it definitely helped reduce the severity of infection, hospitalisation and deaths. Majority of those infected now are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Except for two districts — Kasaragod and Malappuram — the state's hospital infrastructure is not overburdened,” said Dr Santosh Kumar S S, deputy medical superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram medical college, who had worked with Covid patients in the first phase. Over 68% of the state's adult population have got at least one dose of the vaccine and 24% both doses.


Health economist Rijo John said the current surge could slow down in a week or so. “By then, the natural infection and vaccinations would have taken the population-level Covid-19 immunity to 60-70%, bringing it closer to the rest of India but with much less human toll. During this period, it is key to ensure that our healthcare system doesn’t collapse,” he said.
The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.51% is amongst the lowest in the country despite allegations of hiding/undercounting Covid deaths. On an average, 131 deaths are reported per day for a week, of which there about 10% are backlog deaths.


“Thankfully, despite the large Covid-19 numbers now, the deaths are not as much as they used to be, and hospitalised numbers are relatively smaller. However, if beds start filling up rapidly, more stringent measures will be needed. We need a system where we can see far ahead and respond efficiently, without choking the common man’s livelihood,” Dr Jayadevan said.

Half of India’s adults have now got at least one dose of vaccine,2101,"NEW DELHI: Half of the country's adult population eligible for Covid vaccines has received at least one dose, which includes 99% coverage among healthcare workers and 100% front-line workers for the first dose. A little more than 60% of the over-60 population has also been covered by at least a first dose of the vaccine.
The average daily vaccinations during August so far also increased to 52.16 lakh doses from 43.41 lakh and 39.38 lakh in July and June respectively. The government said supply situation of vaccines appears satisfactory as in the past few weeks there have been no reports from any state on vaccine shortages.

“In last three weeks, balanced unutilised vaccine doses count in the country has never gone below 2.5 crore,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, underlining that the Centre takes stock of the supply and availability situation from states and UTs every morning.
Bhushan also highlighted that the Centre has urged states to ramp up vaccination, particularly coverage of second dose of the jabs, with better availability of vaccines. He said the real concern remains the high incidence of the disease in states like Kerala which give rise to fears that a ready host of vulnerable persons may see the emergence of new mutant strain.

While only 14.6% of the 94 crore adult population is fully vaccinated so far, 83% of healthcare workers and 79% of front-line workers eligible for the second shot have been covered with both the doses, official data show.
Vaccine supplies are also likely to improve further from October as Zydus Cadila has indicated to the government that its DNA-based anti-Covid jab, ZyCoV-D, will be available from the first week of October. The government is still negotiating with the company on terms and price of procurement, Bhushan said.
While ZyCoV-D has been given emergency use authorisation for use in all above 12 years, the final decision regarding starting vaccination of children of 12-18 years will be based on National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s recommendations, which are yet to be submitted to the health ministry.

‘New appointment policy will strengthen healthcare facilities’,2382,"Ranchi: A day after the Jharkhand cabinet gave its approval to the department of health, medical education and family welfare’s proposal to frame new appointment regulations to recruit professors and assistant professors in medical colleges on a contractual basis, the state health minister, Banna Gupta, on Wednesday termed the new policy as a ‘historical one’. He said that not only will it strengthen healthcare facilities but also improve medical studies in Jharkhand.
While talking about the advantages of the policy, Banna said, “With the new policy, we will ensure that all vacant posts are filled up at the earliest, so that academic sessions can start on time this year. Our students had suffered a lot due to the National Medical Commission’s (NMC) control over the admission process of the three new medical colleges (Palamu, Hazaribag and Dumka) in Jharkhand. Had NMC allowed admissions to take place, we would have hired 300 aspiring doctors last year.”

Last year, the NMC had not allowed admissions to take place in the medical colleges of Palamu, Dumka and Hazaribag by citing lack of specialised faculty members.
The contractual system of employment has a massive attrition rate in Jharkhand and when TOI asked Banna about it, he said, “Although it’s true that the contractual system is marred by protests, as we have seen in the past, we must keep in mind that people protest when they aren’t paid for their work and are removed forcibly even when they haven’t done anything wrong, a practice followed by earlier governments. In the new policy, we have made it a point to make sure that an employee’s benefits are not affected anytime.”

Under the new policy, a professor will be paid a salary ranging from Rs 2.2 lakh to 2.5 lakh while an associate professor will be paid a monthly remuneration between Rs 1.88 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. The policy also states that the faculty members will be appointed for a two-year term and he/she will have the opportunity of becoming a permanent staff during his/her tenure.
Asked if the new policy only applies only to the new medical colleges, Banna said, “It will be effective for all medical colleges and for any department or superspecialty hospital that needs resources.”
Upon contact, a senior health department official said that there are over 200 vacant posts across state and they needs to be filled up at the earliest.

Experts favour booster for healthcare workers,2269,"Pune: Top vaccine experts have said there has been a sudden increase in the demand for booster shots by healthcare workers, who are directly in contact with Covid-19 patients.
The experts said it has already been five-six months since many of the healthcare workers took their second shot and there are fears of the antibody levels waning.

Vaccine expert Dr Naveen Thacker, who was also part of the committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management, told TOI, “Considering the possibility of future waves and long Covid, booster shots for this segment should be given a priority once the supply is ensured.”
He said, “The government is saying that a person can stay protected against serious infection and death months after the second dose. But now research is showing that even those who have mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 can experience its long-haul symptoms.”

Leading virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI, “Scientifically and immunologically, the healthcare workers should be given priority for the booster doses. A booster dose is ordinarily given six months after the first schedule of the two doses. At present, this is the right interval for the booster doses for many of them.”
He said, “Programmatically, the government will have to take a call on dividing the available doses in three portions for three priority groups: one for healthcare workers’ booster doses, second portion exclusively for people whose second doses are due and the third portion for citizens who have not yet taken the first dose of the vaccine. The government should formulate a policy, which may include priority booster doses for healthcare workers aged above 55.”
Dr J A Jayalal, national president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “Scientifically, a policy on booster doses for healthcare workers is required, with the fears of a third wave imminent. We have, however, left it to the government to take a suitable call as per the availability of vaccines because a bulk of the population is yet to be inoculated.”
Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, however, said there was no need for booster shots at this time. “It’s more important to give at least one dose to the maximum number of people and finish up with the two doses,” he said.

Private companies back health-tech start-ups amidst pandemic,3704,"NEW DELHI: Health-tech startups are experiencing one of the biggest transformations in the startup universe. Driven by the Covid-19 urgency, telehealth, which has been around and hardly leveraged for decades has emerged as one of the biggest gainers globally.
A recent McKinsey analysis indicates a 38 times rise in telehealth services in the US, which has begun garnering major investor attention. In India till last month, the Central Government’s eSanjeevani initiative completed around 80 lakh consultations in around 16 months.

Private companies, including a few established giants in the healthcare space, are increasingly investing in promising health-tech start-ups by backing their R&D and product development.
GE Healthcare, for instance, unveiled the third Cohort of its flagship initiative India Edison Accelerator. Under the initiative, six health-tech start-ups based out of India and Singapore received a lifetime of an opportunity to be a part of this year’s cohort and leverage GE’s Edison platform.

“We started off with the initiative in August 2019, before COVID-19 hit the world. The idea was to build a larger network of competent health-tech players who can bring complementing innovation and technologies to a common cloud-backed platform and accelerate the development of their applications,” said Shravan Subramanyam, president & CEO of GE Healthcare. “The aim was to provide customers with effective solutions that can improve patient outcomes. So since 2019, we have been identifying six promising companies a year while nurturing the start-up ecosystem.”
The India Edison Accelerator’s Cohort 2 also included six promising health-tech start-ups who joined the initiative in 2020 and graduated in June 2021. The start-ups continue to engage with the India Edison Accelerator in the areas of market expansion and technology.
With the selection of each cohort, the companies get to spend around eight months with healthcare industry experts from within and outside GE Healthcare who help them build and scale up their solutions for new market segments. The initiative costs tremendous investment from GE at various levels.
Owing to the disruptions caused by COVID-19, the healthcare segment across the world has experienced strong urgency of potent and effective medical technologies that can deliver high quality and personalized diagnosis, treatment, and care, at a scale and speed unimagined today.
Driven by the urgency of the times, the India Edison Accelerator’s Cohort 3 on-boarded the six companies that are working towards the invention and development of health-tech solutions which can address the urgent gap revealed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The health-tech start-ups 4basecare, Haystack Analytics, zMed Healthcare Technologies, Tricog, AIRA Matrix, and Qritive are invested in inventing, developing and creating solutions in the domains of genomics and digital health, simplifying complex genomic analysis, clinical data integration and advanced clinical AI solutions; making virtual cardiology services available to remote clinics; AI-based solutions to automate image and data analysis; and AI-powered CE marked digital pathology platform and AI, respectively.
“With every Cohort, we try to assess the need of the hour. In post COVID environment, there has been significant uptake on remote patient monitoring, virtual care, virtual hospitals, and specific clinical carriers like oncology and cardiology,” said Girish Raghavan, VP, Engineering – GE Healthcare South Asia. “So for Cohort 3, we have been looking at specific companies in the market who got specialization in areas like oncology, cardiology, remote patient monitoring, and data aggregation, etc.”

Delhi: Brother donates kidney to elder sister,2981,"NEW DELHI: On the eve of Rakshabandhan, a 28-year-old man gave the gift of life to his elder sister beset with prolonged dialysis of her kidneys.
The brother donated his kidney to his elder sister, who risked losing her life due to kidney failure after prolonged dialysis.

Hailing from Rohtak in Haryana, the 31-year-old woman had been suffering from kidney problems for five years and had been on medical treatment for long and neglected her high blood pressure causing damage to her kidneys, doctors at Aakash Healthcare said here.“Unfortunately, like many other patients, she had also fallen victim to the myths regarding dialysis and delaying the initiation, which worsened her condition. Around three years ago, her condition deteriorated suddenly and she was admitted to an ICU,” the doctors said.
“There, she was diagnosed with tuberculosis due to her poor immunity and her lungs were filled with fluid due to heart failure,” they said.

The delay in dialysis and uncontrolled blood pressure had led to weakening of her heart, they said.
Her dialysis began immediately along with other treatments, good diet and rehabilitation that led to improvement in her health.
However, after assessing her overall condition, and considering her young age, doctors advised a kidney transplant.
Dr Vikram Kalra, additional director, department of nephrology and kidney transplant, Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, who transplanted the kidney, said, “Her prolonged high blood pressure was caused by the initial kidney disease which was not addressed properly. This led to rapid progression of kidney failure and damage to other organs. She required dialysis thrice a week in the hospital and later underwent a kidney transplant.""
According to the senior doctor, diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) are the most common causes of kidney disease.
Ninety per cent of patients affected with kidney disease have high blood pressure, but overall, five out of 100 hypertension patients may face kidney damage.
“Many in her family volunteered to be the live donor. Her husband was the first one but he was not a fit candidate as their blood groups did not match.Fortunately, her brother's blood group matched and we completed the transplant in a five-hour-long surgery. It was a challenging surgery because her heart was pumping at only 25% capacity, the risk of pulmonary oedema (accumulation of excess fluid in the lungs) remained”.
However, the transplant was successful since her body accepted the organ and her heart function improved as well. “She can lead a normal life of a young, married woman she can even become a mother when she chooses,” he said.
“My sister was suffering a lot. It was unbearable. When the doctors said that I can donate because our blood groups matched and answered all our questions, I did not think twice before agreeing to give her a kidney from my body. She is very precious to me and I am very happy that she can live a happy life from now on,” he said.

Philippines' Duterte orders payment of healthcare workers' benefits,1838,"MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the health and budget ministries to arrange payment for healthcare workers who have not received their benefits on time, following nurses' threats to resign and strike warnings by unions.
Hospitals fear that desertions of medical staff, particularly nurses, have reached a critical point just as the Delta variant sends infections cases soaring, as it has elsewhere in Southeast Asia and globally.

""Pay them. Use whatever money there is,"" Duterte told health minister Franscisco Duque, who is facing questions over more than $1 billion in Covid-19 spending, including non-payment of medical workers' benefits.
The order came after union leaders in hospitals in virus hot spots threatened last week to strike, while a nursing group said dozens could resign over unpaid risk allowances and hazard pay, adding pressure to facilities battling staff shortages.

The private hospitals association of the Philippines (PHAPi) estimated that 40% of private hospital nurses resigned last year, but more followed new waves of infections this year. Public hospitals face similar challenges.
Duterte, in a recorded speech aired on Saturday, also gave the department of budget and management 10 days to help settle unpaid benefits of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers in public and private hospitals.
More than 18 months into the pandemic, Covid-19 infections in the Philippines stand at more than 1.8 million, ranking as Southeast Asia's second highest. It reported its biggest one-day increase in cases on Friday.
Deaths exceed 31,000, or just under 2% of total cases.
Duterte, whose government faces criticism for its handling of the pandemic, insisted there was no corruption at the health ministry, reiterating support for Duque in response to critics' demands for his resignation.

Government panel recommends emergency use authorisation to Zydus Cadila's 3-dose Covid vaccine,1392,"NEW DELHI: An expert panel of India's central drug authority has recommended granting emergency use authorisation to Zydus Cadila's three-dose Covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D, sources said.
The subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) deliberated on the application given by Zydus Cadila on Thursday and recommended granting emergency use authorisation to its three-dose coronavirus vaccine.

The recommendations have been sent to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for final approval.
The Ahmedabad-based pharma major had on July 1 applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the DCGI for the vaccine.

The company said it has conducted the largest clinical trial for the vaccine in India in over 50 centres so far.
If approved, ZyCoV-D will be the world's first DNA vaccine against the novel coronavirus infection, developed by an Indian company and become the sixth vaccine which has been approved for use in the country after Serum Institute's Covishield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Russia's Sputnik V and the US-made Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.
Plasmid DNA-based ZyCoV-D is to be administered intradermally using a needle-free injector.
Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare had said that the vaccine, when approved, would help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12 to 18 years age group.

"Karnataka: Girls in govt schools, colleges to get free sanitary napkins",2259,"BENGALURU: The government will distribute sanitary napkins among adolescent girls in schools and colleges under the Shuchi project to help maintain hygiene and curb infections.
The cabinet on Thursday decided to procure and distribute 10 pads per girl student in all government and aided schools and colleges. “A sum of Rs 47 crore is being provided for this scheme,” said law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy. Initially, around 3 lakh girls in government and aided schools and hostels of various government departments will get the napkins. Officials expect the number to increase as this is a demand-driven scheme.

The state cabinet also approved the Karnataka State Mental Healthcare Rules, 2021 for implementation of the Centre’s Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The aim is to provide healthcare and services to persons with mental illness and to protect, promote and fulfil the rights of such individuals.
Madhuswamy said under the rules, a state mental health authority will be constituted, and a committee headed by the director of Nimhans, Bengaluru, has been formed to draft the rules. The authority will maintain a register of clinical psychologists, nurses and psychiatric social workers registered to work as mental health professionals and publish the list.

“Issues related to mental health assumed importance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social and economic concerns such as job loss, loss of income, death of family members and fear, have triggered mental health conditions among people,” the minister said.
The cabinet also decided to upgrade 2,859 health sub-centres at a cost of Rs 479 crore in partnership with the Union government. The Centre will bear 60 per cent of the scheme’s cost. Under the project, the sub-centres will be upgraded with necessary manpower and infrastructure, Madhuswamy said, adding that the exercise will be completed in three years.
“Post upgradation, these centres will be brought under the National Rural Health Mission programme. Sixty per cent of the grant will come from the Centre...Wherever there are vacancies, staff nurses and auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANMs) will be outsourced or BSc nursing graduates will be taken for three years and they will be given a consolidated salary,” he said.

"In Mysuru, most Covid patients breathed their last at hospitals",1712,"MYSURU: A survey and analysis of Covid-19 fatalities in Mysuru district has revealed that most patients who succumbed to the infection did so in the hospital. Narasimharaja assembly constituency registered the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities, in the district, followed by Krishnaraja segment.
Of the 2,340 people who succumbed to Covid-19 across Mysuru, 1,178 breathed their last in government hospitals, while 1,115 died at private healthcare centres. While 40 patients breathed their last at home, 38 Covid-19 patients were declared ‘brought dead’ at various hospitals. As many as seven Mysuru district residents died at hospitals in other districts.

Krishna Rajendra (KR) Hospital registered the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities among government institutions, with 528 infected patients breathing their last at the hospital, while 428 died at the District Hospital on KRS Road. As many as 482 patients who succumbed to Covid-19 in Mysuru city were from Narasimharaja assembly segment, while 470 were from Krishnaraja. Chamundeshwari and Chamaraja assembly constituencies reported respectively 372 and 175 Covid-19 fatalities.
Outside Mysuru city, Nanjangud taluk, which was the epicentre of the country’s first ‘cluster case’, registered the highest number of Covid fatalities, with 146 dying of the infection, while 117 people in T Narasipura taluk succumbed to Covid. The newly formed Saligrama taluk reported a mere 18 fatalities, while Saragur registered only 28. Krishnaraja MLA SA Ramadas said that the number of Covid fatalities in his assembly constituency were owing to the concentration of government and private hospitals. “We are following each reported case seriously,” Ramadas said.

"Covid-19: With no beds, hospitals ship patients to far-off cities",5731,"MISSION: Many overwhelmed hospitals, with no beds to offer, are putting critically ill Covid-19 patients on planes, helicopters and ambulances and sending them hundreds of miles to far-flung states for treatment.
The surge in the delta variant of the virus, combined with low vaccination rates, has pushed hospitals to the brink in many states and resulted in a desperate scramble to find beds for patients.

The issue is that large hospitals in urban areas already were running short of space and staff with non-Covid procedures like cancer biopsies and hip replacements when the summer surge started. That means they have very few free beds to offer to patients from small rural hospitals without ICUs or from medical centers in virus hotspots.
“Just imagine not having the support of your family near, to have that kind of anxiety if you have someone grow acutely ill,” said Steve Edwards, CEO of CoxHealth, whose hospital in Springfield, Missouri, is treating patients from as far away as Alabama.

Hospitals across the US had more than 75,000 coronavirus patients as of last week, a dramatic increase from a few weeks ago but still well below the winter surge records. However, Florida, Arkansas, Oregon, Hawaii, Louisiana and Mississippi all have set pandemic records for Covid hospitalisations in recent weeks.
Unlike the winter surge, hospitals this summer were already strained because emergency room volumes are back to pre-pandemic levels and patients are catching up on care they put off.
“We are seeing Covid patients and we are seeing car accidents and we are seeing kids come in with normal seasonal viral infections. And we are seeing normal life come into the emergency department along with the extra surge of Covid patients so it is causing that crisis,” said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians.
In Arizona, a special Covid-19 hotline is getting desperate calls from hospitals in Wyoming, Arkansas, Texas and California who are in search of bed space.
Often, there are no takers.
“We just can’t get them out,” lamented Dennis Shelby, CEO of the 15-bed Wilson Medical Center in Neodesha, Kansas. Officials at the small hospital recently called 40 other facilities in multiple states seeking a bed for a Covid-19 patient, before finally finding one more than a day later about 220 miles (354.06 kilometers) away. Six of its seven patients have Covid-19, a pandemic high.
In Kansas, sick Covid-19 patients at small rural hospitals are waiting an average of nearly 10 hours to be flown somewhere else, according to Motient, a company contracting with the state to help manage transfers.
Dr. Richard Watson, founder of Motient, said Kansas patients are being sent as far away as Wisconsin Illinois, Colorado and Texas. Often, though, the rural hospitals just muddle through.
“That is just the worst day that you can have in the emergency room as a provider to be taking care of a patient that you are totally helpless to give them what you know they need,” he said.
He said the delayed transfers can have dire consequences for patients, especially those who urgently need to see specialists, often available only in bigger hospitals, for issues such as strokes or heart attacks.
“Imagine being with your grandma in the ER who is having a heart attack in western Kansas and you are saying, ’Why can’t we find a bed for her?' We are watching this happen right in front of us. ‘This is America. Why don’t we have hospital bed for her.' Well here we are.""
In Washington state, the 25-bed Prosser Memorial Hospital doesn’t have an intensive care unit, so it often sends critically ill patients elsewhere in the state. Hospital spokeswoman Shannon Hitchcock said Washington state hospitals are full, so Prosser patients are being sent as far away as eastern Idaho — 600 miles (965.61 kilometers) away.
Luke Smith, director of the Arizona Surge Line, which coordinates Covid-19 patient transfers for Arizona patients and offers advice to out-of-state hospitals, said people arriving at emergency rooms “are more acutely ill than we have seen historically.”
Finding a hospital to take them is made more difficult by staffing shortages, after pandemic-fatigued doctors and nurses walked away.
“Most of them are saying it isn’t that they don’t have an open bed, it is that they don’t have nursing staff to care for them,” said Robin Allaman, chief nursing officer at the 25-bed Kearny County Hospital in tiny Lakin, Kansas. Officials there called hospitals in Nebraska, Oklahoma and New Mexico before one in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 200 miles (321.87 kilometers) away, agreed to take a recent patient.
Allaman has no idea how many calls they made. “I think we quit counting,” she said.
High vaccination rates among the 65-plus age group group that filled beds early in the pandemic were supposed to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed again. But Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins, said there hasn’t been the kind of reduction in hospitalizations that officials had hoped for because the delta variant seems to be more severe, particularly in younger age groups, whose vaccination rates are lower.
University of Iowa Healthcare in Iowa City has been getting calls from out-of-state hospitals seeking transfers, said Dr. Theresa Brennan, the hospital’s chief medical officer. They turn down most of them “because we have beds full of our Iowans.”
Des Moines emergency medicine specialist Dr. Clint Hawthorne, like many doctors in Iowa, is concerned the situation could get worse after the Iowa State Fair, which is expected to draw 1 million people.
“How are we going to be able to handle that?” Hawthorne said. “There’s not a good answer to that.”

Healthcare sector growth boosts work opportunities,2781,"PUNE: Experts in the education and healthcare sectors have pointed to the ample opportunity for students in the healthcare field which offers diplomas, certificates, degrees and even doctoral programmes which do not always require NEET qualifications.
The Covid-19 pandemic brought into focus deficiencies in the healthcare sector including a shortage of medical staff in the state. Apart from doctors and nurses, an equally important role is played by the pharmacists, technicians and other paramedic staff that ensure smooth functioning of hospitals, clinics and laboratories.



While good doctors and nursing staff are important for any healthcare facility, similarly any healthcare provider needs equally skilled, paramedical and support staff to deliver the required services in a better manner, said Rekha Dubey, chief executive officer (CEO), Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital.

“This is to ensure that the best treatment is offered to patients and the idea of precautionary care is encouraged. When a student chooses to make a career in any of these fields, it is important to complete these degrees/ diplomas from hospital-affiliated colleges to get first-hand experience and to have authentic knowledge and skills. Apart from paramedical field, epidemiology, equipment management, speech therapist, drug inspector, pharma/ drug expert, nutritionist amongst others will be in demand in the coming years,” she added.
Rajesh Deshpande, president of Baner Balewadi Medicos’ Association, who also works as a consultant with hospitals on their business development felt if the student is in dire need of a job after Std X or Std XII, then instead of taking up a conventional degree course, it is always better to take up a certificate or diploma course as a technician.
“There are all kinds of pathological and diagnostic laboratories where people can get jobs easily. Apart from that, there are MRI technicians and cath lab assistants who are paid very well,” said Deshpande.
Bhavesh Barde, consulting orthopaedic surgeon at Suretech Hospital in Nagpur, said standardisation of courses and entry to them is necessary. “Nowadays, any institute can offer these courses. There is no quality check on the syllabus as well as the certificate or diploma offered. All these courses must be on the same level nationally. Though there are jobs after completing the courses, the pay scale of many technicians is not good. If the curriculum is standardised and placements begin at colleges, the pay scale would also improve. But, not all technicians or paramedics get paid poorly. There are courses such as dialysis assistants or cath lab assistants or even OT assistants who are paid well. Hence, there is ambiguity in these allied medical fields which need to be properly standardised.”

"Quality education, health taking Delhi on US growth path: Minister Satyendar Jain",2223,"NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that the Delhi government is bringing development in Delhi through the same path that countries like the United Kingdom and the US have taken by providing quality healthcare and quality education.
“Delhi government is for the people and by the people and is the only government working to provide quality amenities to the underprivileged. With people’s support only the Arvind Kejriwal government got 90% seats in Delhi consecutively, which is historic in itself,” Jain said on Wednesday after inaugurating a multi-purpose community centre at Alipur Village in north Delhi’s Narela.



“We have fulfilled the chief minister’s promise to the people and our work speaks for itself,” he said, adding that he is looking forward to beautifying this centre, which will play a crucial role in the village’s development. Narela MLA Sharad Kumar Chauhan and senior officials of Delhi government were present during the inauguration.

“The UK and the US developed only because of free quality education and healthcare. The AAP government is bringing the same kind of development to Delhi. This government has been the first one in the nation to take up the issue of quality amenities as a prime responsibility and we are making remarkable progress in healthcare and education with each passing day,” the minister said.
Jain said that politicians are elected for taking the nation forward and they should be selfless and tireless in their service. “We as a government owe everything to the people and our people-oriented, corruption-free governance model has awakened people about their legitimate rights of quality education and healthcare,” he said.
“Delhi government is accused of doing politics of ‘free services’ but we ask if we are judiciously using public money and giving it back to the people through free and quality services then what’s the harm? We have not introduced any new tax and we will continue to work tirelessly in finding innovative ways of delivering the most appropriate policies for the people,” he said.
Will is the key to achieving anything and no task is impossible, but requires commitment, which Jain alleged previous governments didn’t show.

Single vax shot doesn’t offer much protection against Covid-19: Delhi study,4072,"NEW DELHI: A single vaccine dose does not offer significant protection against symptomatic or severe Covid-19 infections, a study conducted by a leading private hospital in Delhi suggests, reports Durgesh Nandan Jha.
The study is based on Covid infections among healthcare workers at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital from March 1 to May 31 this year, during the deadly second wave.



Dr Ruma Satwik, the lead author of the study, told TOI their study on vaccine effectiveness revealed that a single dose offered very little protection against symptomatic infections or any “outcome of interest”, that is, the risk of developing severe symptoms or death due to Covid-19.

6 died of Covid at SGRH in 3 mths, 5 were unvaccinated
As per the study, the incidence of symptomatic infection in healthcare workers who had received a single dose of the vaccine (after 21 days of getting the shot) was 12.3%, as compared to 13.9% in the unvaccinated group. Around 2% of the partially vaccinated study subjects developed moderate to severe disease and 0.7% required supplemental oxygen therapy on contracting Covid-19. In comparison, 3.3% of the unvaccinated healthcare workers developed moderate to severe disease and 1.7% required supplemental oxygen therapy. As these figures show, there was little difference between the two groups on susceptibility to the virus.
“Our findings are in line with the Public Health Scotland data on single-dose protection against the Delta variant. However, it is in contrast to a modestly reduced but significant protection offered by a single dose as seen in the study from CMC Vellore (50% protection) and Public Health England (33% protection),” she said.
The study included 4,296 healthcare workers employed at SGRH. Of them, Dr Satwik said, 2,716 had received two doses of Covishield, 623 had received a single dose of the vaccine and 937 were not vaccinated as on April 30. There were 20 others who had received either Covaxin or Pfizer, and they were not included in the study.
Between March 1 and May 31, the doctor said, 526 out of 4276 (13%) healthcare workers tested positive for Covid-19, of which 2% were asymptomatic, 82% had mild symptoms, 10% had moderate symptoms and 5% had severe disease. Six healthcare workers died due to Covid-19, of which five were unvaccinated and one had received a single dose of the vaccine. There were no mortalities among the fully-vaccinated healthcare workers.
However, the study showed, several healthcare workers did get infected and developed symptoms despite being fully vaccinated. The vaccine effectiveness for two doses of Covishield given at a median interval of 30 days was 28% for symptomatic infections, 67% for moderate to severe disease, 76% for supplemental oxygen therapy and nearly 97% for deaths. “Our study reports lower protection by two doses from symptomatic infections. But, it also shows that fully vaccinated people have high levels of protection against moderate to severe disease, supplemental oxygen therapy and deaths,” said one of the researchers.
The findings of the SGRH study have been published in the letters to the editor column of the European Journal of Internal Medicine. Interestingly, the authors noted that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly protective against all studied outcomes, with an effectiveness of 93% seen against symptomatic infections, 89% against moderate to severe disease and 85% against supplemental oxygen therapy. All deaths occurred in previously uninfected individuals, the authors have stated, adding that previous infection offered higher protection than that offered by single or double dose of the vaccine.
“This information may be useful in deciding vaccine policy.

Single Covid-19 vaccine shot offers virtually no shield: Hospital study,4046,"NEW DELHI: A single vaccine dose does not offer significant protection against symptomatic or severe Covid-19 infections, a study conducted by a leading private hospital in Delhi suggests.
The study is based on Covid infections among healthcare workers at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital from March 1 to May 31 this year, during the deadly second wave.

Dr Ruma Satwik, the lead author of the study, told TOI their study on vaccine effectiveness revealed that a single dose offered very little protection against symptomatic infections or any “outcome of interest”, that is, the risk of developing severe symptoms or death due to Covid-19.



6 Died of covid at SGRH in 3 months, 5 were unvaccinated
As per the study, the incidence of symptomatic infection in healthcare workers who had received a single dose of the vaccine (after 21 days of getting the shot) was 12.3%, as compared to 13.9% in the unvaccinated group. Around 2% of the partially vaccinated study subjects developed moderate to severe disease and 0.7% required supplemental oxygen therapy on contracting Covid-19. In comparison, 3.3% of the unvaccinated healthcare workers developed moderate to severe disease and 1.7% required supplemental oxygen therapy. As these figures show, there was little difference between the two groups on susceptibility to the virus.
“Our findings are in line with the Public Health Scotland data on single-dose protection against the Delta variant. However, it is in contrast to a modestly reduced but significant protection offered by a single dose as seen in the study from CMC Vellore (50% protection) and Public Health England (33% protection),” she said.
The study included 4,296 healthcare workers employed at SGRH. Of them, Dr Satwik said, 2,716 had received two doses of Covishield, 623 had received a single dose of the vaccine and 937 were not vaccinated as on April 30. There were 20 others who had received either Covaxin or Pfizer, and they were not included in the study.
Between March 1 and May 31, the doctor said, 526 out of 4276 (13%) healthcare workers tested positive for Covid-19, of which 2% were asymptomatic, 82% had mild symptoms, 10% had moderate symptoms and 5% had severe disease. Six healthcare workers died due to Covid-19, of which five were unvaccinated and one had received a single dose of the vaccine. There were no mortalities among the fully-vaccinated healthcare workers.
However, the study showed, several healthcare workers did get infected and developed symptoms despite being fully vaccinated. The vaccine effectiveness for two doses of Covishield given at a median interval of 30 days was 28% for symptomatic infections, 67% for moderate to severe disease, 76% for supplemental oxygen therapy and nearly 97% for deaths. “Our study reports lower protection by two doses from symptomatic infections. But, it also shows that fully vaccinated people have high levels of protection against moderate to severe disease, supplemental oxygen therapy and deaths,” said one of the researchers.
The findings of the SGRH study have been published in the letters to the editor column of the European Journal of Internal Medicine. Interestingly, the authors noted that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly protective against all studied outcomes, with an effectiveness of 93% seen against symptomatic infections, 89% against moderate to severe disease and 85% against supplemental oxygen therapy. All deaths occurred in previously uninfected individuals, the authors have stated, adding that previous infection offered higher protection than that offered by single or double dose of the vaccine.

States that had a grip on Covid now seeing a crush of cases,4404,"The Covid-19 surge that is sending hospitalizations to all-time highs in parts of the South is also clobbering states like Hawaii and Oregon that were once seen as pandemic success stories.
After months in which they kept cases and hospitalizations at manageable levels, they are watching progress slip away as record numbers of patients overwhelm bone-tired health care workers.

Oregon - like Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana in recent days - has more people in the hospital with Covid-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. Hawaii is about to reach that mark, too.
This, despite both states having vaccination levels higher than the national average as of last week. Arkansas and Louisiana were significantly below average, while Florida was about even.

""It's heartbreaking. People are exhausted. You can see it in their eyes,"" said Dr. Jason Kuhl, chief medical officer at Oregon's Providence Medford Medical Center, where patients are left on gurneys in hallways, their monitoring machines beeping away.
In other developments, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize Covid-19 booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, to give them an extra dose of protection.
The US is seeing the virus storming back, driven by a combination of the highly contagious delta variant and lagging vaccination rates, especially in the South and other rural and conservative parts of the country.
New cases nationwide are averaging about 123,000 per day, a level last seen in early February, and deaths are running at over 500 a day, turning the clock back to May.
For the most part during the pandemic, Hawaii enjoyed one of the lowest infection and death rates in the nation. In recent days, though, it reported record highs of more than 600 new virus cases daily.
On its worst day in 2020, Hawaii had 291 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. Officials expect to hit 300 by the end of this week.
Despite the promising demand for Covid-19 shots early on, it took three weeks - much longer than expected - to get from 50% to 60% of the vaccine-eligible population fully vaccinated. Vaccinations have since plateaued. Nationally, the rate is about 59%.
The biggest hospital on Hawaii's Big Island is feeling the pressure. Out of 128 acute beds, 116 were taken Wednesday at Hilo Medical Center, and the hospital's 11 intensive care unit beds are almost always full these days, spokeswoman Elena Cabatu said.
""If someone out there has a heart attack or a sepsis or gets into a bad accident that requires intensive care, we will have to hold that person in the emergency department,"" Cabatu said.
""I'm surprised we landed here,"" she lamented. ""The hope during the mass vax clinics was just so high.""
Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, disputed any notion that the rebound in tourism in Hawaii is largely to blame.
""The tourists have been a source for infection, but they've never been the predominant source of infection,"" Raethel said. ""There's a lot more concern about people from Hawaii, residents who go to the South, go to Vegas, to other places, and they come back and spread it.""
In Oregon, gov Kate Brown announced this week that nearly everyone will have to wear masks again in indoor public spaces, regardless of their vaccination status.
For the second straight day Wednesday, the state reported a record number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients - 665. The previous peak of 622 came during a November surge, before the vaccine became available. ICU beds across the state are about 90% full.
Throughout the pandemic, health officials have described Oregon as a success story, largely because of its tight restrictions, which were lifted at the end of June.
Meanwhile, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said more people are getting vaccinated in states with the highest infection rates, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.
""We're getting more shots in the arms in the places that need them in the most. That's what it's going to take to end this pandemic,"" he said.
In Florida, where Republican gov Ron DeSantis has steadfastly blocked mandatory mask-wearing, some emergency rooms are so overcrowded that doctors are sending patients home with oxygen and small, portable oxygen-monitoring devices to free up beds for sicker patients.

Odisha's Covid helpline number flooded with prank calls,2319,"BHUBANESWAR: The state’s Covid helpline number, 104, continues to be flooded with prank calls of obscene nature made by unknown callers. Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL), which operates the health help desk, recently lodged a fresh complaint with the Saheed Nagar police here, seeking action against the pranksters.
“We had first drawn the attention of the commissionerate police to the issue in April last year. However, the problem still persists. Mischief-mongers continue to trouble our call centre executives. Their mischievous conduct has been demotivating our employees. We have lodged another complaint with the police,” ZHL’s senior vice president Sabyasachi Biswal said.

Apart from handling Covid-related queries, the ZHL’s centralized call centre here also attends to calls for ambulance services, including those for pregnant women and infants. The ZHL receives around 30,000-35,000 calls every day.
According to the dial-104 service operator, at least 10% of the total calls are fake and vulgar in nature. In the latest complaint, the company has shared 30 phone numbers, whose callers spoke in obscene language with the women staff of the call centre between January 1 and May 31 this year.

“We received fake and vulgar calls from a phone number (7205789242) 492 times at regular intervals. A person called from 9078397730 no less than 201 times. Callers from altogether 30 phone numbers made frequent calls. We have shared all these numbers with the police,” Biswal said.
The unknown callers insisted on the women call receivers sharing their personal numbers for chat, asked them to recharge their mobile phones, invited them for lunch and dinner. They hurled abuses when the women call centre executives warned them of police action.
“We not only feel irritated, but are also worried for those genuine and distressed callers, who are forced to wait in queues for several minutes because of such stupid calls,” a woman staff said.
The police, which have not arrested a single prankster since last year, said efforts are on to identify the accused.
“We appeal to people to not make such fake and unnecessary calls to the state health helpline number. We are trying to ascertain the identities of the unknown callers by tracing their mobile phones,” deputy commissioner of police Uma Shankar Dash said.

Bhagalpur to get trauma centre,1247,"BHAGALPUR: With an aim to provide emergency healthcare for emergency resuscitation, surgery, intensive care and other medical facilities to patients suffering from serious injuries, the Sadar hospital here is endeavouring to establish a ‘trauma centre’ soon.
It would be of level-III, to be equipped and staffed to provide emergency medicare to patients suffering from various traumatic injuries, including accidents and vehicle collisions.

Bhagalpur civil surgeon (CS) Dr Umesh Sharma, when contacted, said efforts were on and a trauma centre at Sadar hospital would start functioning very soon. He said steps were being taken for adding medical infrastructure besides capacity building for the trauma centre.
“We will need three orthopaedic surgeons, medical experts trained in treating patients under medical emergencies, anaesthetics, operation theatre assistants and nursing and paramedical staff for 24 hours monitoring of patients suffering from traumatic injuries. We will also need oxygen-beds, advance life support ambulance service, blood of different groups, Dr Sharma said and added that the trauma centre would be of level-III in order to provide initial evaluation and stabilization (surgically, if needed) to the trauma patients.

Karnataka medical practitioners keen on booster doses,3652,"BENGALURU: Medical practitioners, who were the first in the state to get inoculated when the vaccination drive against Covid-19 began on January 16 this year, are keen on taking a third dose, making ‘booster dose’ a buzzword among healthcare workers.
Many doctors TOI spoke with say that with a third wave of infections imminent, a booster shot is now inevitable especially since they work in areas where the viral load is high and are highly vulnerable to infection. Some healthcare workers have quietly taken a shot of Covaxin after being fully vaccinated with two doses of Covishield, but most are waiting for WHO guidelines and government of India directives on the issue.

However, while discussion on the subject among healthcare workers is growing, there are some who are apprehensive about taking a booster dose, says Dr Smitha S Segu, nodal officer for Covid management at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI).
“Most vaccines that we took from childhood had booster doses,” said Dr Segu. “Covid too may need a booster dose. Everyone is waiting for a directive from WHO and the government. We still don’t know about the efficacy of the vaccines against new variants and there have been cases of breakthrough infections.”

Dr HS Sudarshan Ballal, member, Covid expert committee, said a booster dose is desirable but must be based on government directives, while Dr Meghana Reddy, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Children’s Hospital, Marathahalli, said the vaccine is protecting healthcare workers in high viral load areas.
“During the second wave, our hospital alone treated 300 pregnant women. Of them, at least 100 had an active Covid infection. While we helped them deliver their babies, we were not infected. Could PPE alone have protected us? It must have been the vaccines which helped,” said Dr Reddy.
But some say the necessity of a third dose must be based on evidence of fewer antibodies after being fully inoculated. Dr Sujay Prasad, medical director, Neuberg Diagnostics, said that if Covid antibodies are less than 100 binding antibody units per ml (BAU/ml), then a booster dose is advised. “If it is more than 400 units, then there is no need to take a booster dose,” he said.
Dr Prasad added: “Immunity from natural infection is much better than vaccination-induced immunity. For every 20 people who were symptomatic and who tested positive for Covid, there are 80 people who were exposed to the virus but were asymptomatic.”
Many of those who have already taken a booster dose, have chosen Covaxin after taking two doses of Covishield. In a recent study, ICMR, said doses of two different vaccines provoked a superior immune response than two doses of the same vaccine. Researchers studied 18 of 20 individuals who were mistakenly given Covishield for the second dose after they had taken Covaxin for the first in Uttar Pradesh in April-May this year. The individuals’ blood samples were analysed at different stages for 60 to 70 days after vaccination.
However, a senior member of Private Hospitals and Nursing homes Association (PHANA) said if healthcare workers take booster doses, they would be depriving those who haven’t even got one dose of much needed protection. “We need to focus currently on ensuring that all healthcare workers are fully vaccinated,” the doctor said.
As on July 31, 1.2 lakh healthcare workers were yet to be vaccinated and nearly 2.5 were partially vaccinated, health and family welfare department data shows. When contacted, Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, said there is no move as of now to provide booster doses for healthcare workers.

"Pune: Vaccine exchange plan lets private hospitals lend excess stock, get fresh doses in return",3157,"PUNE: The district authorities have now suggested a voluntary Covid vaccine “exchange programme” which lets private hospitals give their excess stock of doses to officials and get fresh vials in return.
Officials said if private hospitals agree to participate in the programme, it can can kick off immediately. They said the hospitals can expect to start receiving fresh doses from September 1. The units will also be given a certificate that acknowledges receipt of stock.


TIMESVIEW

This is a win-win situation for the district administration and private hospitals. It's also a solution that can be replicated in other cities, where private hospitals have vaccine doses in stock but very few takers. This will ensure zero wastage of a precious resource that's currently in short supply. All stakeholders involved in this exchange should ensure it works out. The state government, too, should quickly lay down guidelines and approve the plan as soon as possible.


Many private hospitals, due to a dip in turnout for paid jabs, currently have substantial reserves of Covid vaccines (mainly Covishield). Officials said the exchange programme would tap this unused stock and divert it immediately to civic centres before they expire. The private units will be given fresh stock in return. It’s a free initiative; the private hospitals will not be charged any money, officials said.

Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, who is supporting the programme, said the plan will help regions that need immediate supply of vaccines boost coverage.
Pvt hosps can exchange excess stock for fresh doses
Prasad said, “We are making a genuine request to private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to provide their excess doses to the district administration so that our special and routine vaccination drives can be expedited. There is no money involved and it’s all about helping each other. Such a transaction has been done before. A few months ago, Pune borrowed vaccines from Solapur district officials. This time, it will be from private CVCs.”
Prasad estimated that private CVCs currently have more than 4.61 lakh doses in their reserves. It’s a quantity that could prove invaluable for the district, which now has thousands of people fast approaching the due date for a second jab.
Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer with the zilla parishad, said the details of the exchange programme are being worked out and guidelines will soon be sought from the state government.
“We'll start contacting the private CVCs once we get a go-ahead from the state government,"" he said.
Healthcare experts, however, said the district administration will have to convince private units that the initiative will not lead to loss of money or doses.
Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said since the programme essentially involves borrowing of doses, private units may need some guarantees in return.
He said, ""If the district has not been getting a consistent supply of doses, where's the guarantee that there will be good supply in the future? If the situation continues, the purchases by private hospitals will be at risk.""

"6 months on, Karnataka yet to fully jab healthcare and frontline staff",2793,"BENGALURU: About 2.3 lakh healthcare and frontline workers in Karnataka have not got even one dose of Covid-19 vaccine as on July 31. Health department data shows that nearly 1.3 lakh HCWs and over 1 lakh FLWs are in this category.
Vaccination for healthcare workers began on February 8 in Karnataka. While over 9 lakh HCWs were registered, 5.5 lakh have got both doses, and nearly 2.5 lakh are partially vaccinated. Over 10.2 lakh FLWs are enrolled, of which 5.7 lakh have got only one dose and 3.4 lakh are fully vaccinated. This category was prioritised when vaccination was rolled out across the country. The objective was to complete inoculating them first before the general public. Data shows this has not been achieved even after six months.

‘Many jabbed, data not updated’
In Bengaluru, 54,031 HCWs are yet to get even one dose but the data may be flawed, said Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association. “Several doctors work in multiple hospitals as consultants. Their names have been repeated and that inflates th number of workers,” said Dr HM Prasanna, president, PHANA. Some HCWs have deliberately avoided vaccination, he admitted.

“Some HCWs, who hadn’t taken the vaccine when it was launched in January 2021, got infected during the peak in April and May. They have to complete three months from the time of infection to get the jab and may take it in August or September,” he added. Health department authorities claim the issue is not about vaccine hesitancy but data. “There are concerns about data inconsistency and it’s being reconciled,” said Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka.
“Many FCWs workers have already received the second dose, but it’s not reflected in data. That could be a reason for higher number of first dose and partial vaccination categories,” said Dr Chandrashekar. She added that many HCWs and FLWs missed the jabs in January and February and took the first dose in April and May.
Multiple hospitals said over 95% of staffers have been vaccinated, with stray cases of doctors choosing not to get jabbed. During the recent post-graduate medical course exams, an external examiner in a city-based private college was found unvaccinated. “He is a senior surgeon. Vaccination is a must for all those taking part in the examination process,” said sources.
According to Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP, data doesn’t reflect the total number of beneficiaries as many haven’t downloaded certificates. Officers said those who passed out from nursing colleges in 2020 were added to the list and his resulted in higher numbers. “Some non-allopathic doctors and medicos showed reluctance. If Ayush medical college faculty have reservations about vaccination, students follow suit,” said officials.

Ahmedabad: 30% jabbed healthcare staff lose protection after 3 months,3282,"AHMEDABAD: Antibodies either acquired through Covid-19 infection, proximity to an infected family member or vaccination are key to thwarting morbid Covid-illnesses and are subject of intense study and deliberation in preparation for the third wave.
An exhaustive study carried out locally pointed at about 30% recipients, all health workers, recording reduced antibodies after three months.



Notably, 55% of the recipients recorded rise in antibody levels in blood. In another study, carried out by AMC-run hospitals - AMCMET, Maninagar, and NHL MMC, Ellisbridge indicated that the family members of primary Covid patients got higher seropositivity compared to other contacts and general population.

The study, based on the sero survey carried out in October last year, indicated that the family members had 28.8% seropositivity compared to 24.4% in other contacts. Overall seropositivity during the survey was found to be 26%. The findings are published in a recent edition of Journal of Health Science & Medical Research.
With regards to antibodies post-vaccination in healthcare workers, Dr Bhavini Shah, head (microbiology), Neuberg Diagnostics, told TOI that they had chosen 500 vaccinated doctors, nurses, paramedics and other members of medical fraternity, whose antibody titre (blood test to determine presence and level of antibodies) was collected.
“Later, samples were collected a month after both the doses, and the third sample two months after the second sample,” she said, adding that the sample had no prior record of Covid-19 infection.
‘Immunity may last for 6 to 12 months’
Dr Bhavini Shah said that about 55% of recipients recorded a rise in antibody levels in blood. “These antibodies are IgG in nature and have neutralizing effect on the spike protein of coronavirus. The numbers rose significantly (75-100 to 150-200 AU/mL (arbitrary units per millilitre of blood) indicating vaccine efficacy to produce antibodies,” said Dr Shah. “In another 15% of samples, the levels did not change much between the first and second dose.”
But in 30% of the population, after three months, antibodies recorded a dip compared to their previous levels. “It indicates that protection against Covid reduces with time. From about 175-200, the levels were found to be around100-120 at the time of third sampling,” she said. “The impact is similar to flu vaccine that needs booster shots at regular intervals to maintain immunity.” Those who caught Covid during the second wave have a reason to cheer – the study’s results were compared with a database of 30,000-plus samples processed by the lab. The researchers found that those who got natural immunity after getting infected had much higher antibody count (up to 400 AU/ mL) and the impact lasted longer than the one acquired through immunization.
The researchers said that the diminishing impact of vaccination is common among most viral diseases. During the study, they found no definite group susceptible to the phenomenon. “We will be repeating the same exercise at nine months of the first vaccine to see the impact.” Hypothetically, how long will impact of vaccines last? Experts said it may take some more time to assess the actual numbers, but for most of the population, it may last for over six to twelve months.

A 90-fold increase for city’s healthcare infra in 85 years,5441,"Lucknow: From just 270 beds in two institutions in 1947 to about 25,000 beds in 900 government and private hospitals today, Lucknow’s health infrastructure has grown over 90 times in 85 years since independence, making it a healthcare hub in north India where all the latest facilities, including liver and kidney transplants, are available.
However, challenges, too, have increased 10-fold with the population increasing from about 5 lakh in 1947 to about 50 lakh in 2021.

In 1947, Lucknow had just one medical college — King George’s Medical College (now a university) with 250 beds having basic surgical and medical facilities. Besides, there was only one hospital — Balrampur hospital with 20 beds.
Today in public sector medical education, Lucknow can boast of having three premier institutes — KGMU, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences — offering medical education from graduation to super-speciality levels. The Cancer Institute at Chak Gajaria is the latest addition in this category.

These institutions are catering to patients of not only Lucknow and UP, but also from adjoining districts and countries like Nepal and playing a major role in serving people during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. Not just specialised healthcare, particularly for the poor, the contribution of these medical education institutes in producing doctors and researchers is immense. Their alumni are serving across the globe and have established departments, hospitals, medical education and research institutes which have further contributed in building the nation.
Furthermore, KGMU is the only institute in the public sector that is offering dental education. There are also Ayurveda, Unani and homoeopathy colleges in the city. The private sector was nil in medical education at the time of Independence. However, today Lucknow has five private medical colleges and four dental colleges. Starting with just Balrampur hospital, Lucknow today has altogether 12 district hospitals. In addition, there are 83 primary and 19 community healthcare centres, catering to interior and rural areas.
Healthcare in the private sector was limited to small clinics run by individual doctors in 1947, but today there are over 700 private nursing homes and hospitals including top brands of the country.
Crisis of professionals needs addressing
Experts point out that despite drastic growth in the health sector, all healthcare facilities are overloaded, which means that there is further scope of developing more such institutions and strengthening the existing ones.
The government healthcare sector is particularly reeling under the crisis of required strength of doctors as an increasing number of medical graduates now want to serve in cities or corporate hospitals. Medical teaching and research is another area which needs to be made attractive for students. Medical pedagogy also needs to be modernised. There is immense scope of interdisciplinary research as well, they added.
Chief medical superintendent and in charge, trauma centre, Prof Sandeep Tiwari says that to reduce patient load on hospitals, the government needs to strengthen primary health care services at the district level.
Former head of Indian Medical Association Lucknow wing PK Gupta says, “The government should also exploit the city’s potential to be developed as a medical tourism hub by considering it under MSME sector.”
Head of medicine department at KGMU Prof Virendra Atam says, “If all provisions of the National Medical Commission are implemented strictly on every medical college, the quality of medical education will improve.”
Pillars of care
KGMU: Established in 1906, KGMC (now university) is the foundation of medical education in the state. It has 4,500 beds in 55 clinical and non-clinical departments, providing treatment to over 15 lakh patients annually. It has 1,080 seats in bachelor, postgraduate and super speciality courses. It has produced one Padma Vibhushan, six Padma Bhushan, 27 Padma Shri and 45 BC Roy awardees till now. Over 24,000 alumni doctors serving all over the world.
SGPGIMS: A state-of-the-art tertiary care referral centre that was established in 1983. It has 1,050 beds in 29 departments. The institute was the first to start liver transplant and kidney transplant surgery in UP. It has around 450 post-graduate and super-speciality seats. Over 6 lakh patients get treatment in the institute every year.
RMLIMS: Established in 2006, it provides general medical and super-speciality treatment including kidney transplant. It has 30 departments with 1,000-bed strength and caters to around 1.5 lakh patients every year.
Private medical colleges: There are around 16 in the city. Among these, nine offer MBBS, nursing and paramedical courses. Some of them also run BDS courses. They cater to around 11 lakh patients in a year.
Government centres: Lucknow has 12 district hospitals, 19 community healthcare centres and 83 primary health care centres. In 12 district hospitals, there are 3,100 beds whereas PHCs have 400 beds and 180 beds are in CHCs. Over 5 lakh people from across the state get treatment in these facilities every year.
Private healthcare: There are 700 registered private hospitals and nursing homes. As many as 60,000 minor and major surgeries are performed in these hospitals every year. Around 10 lakh patients visit OPDs of these hospitals.

"In Florida hospitals, 'there are only so many beds'",4398,"FORT LAUDERDALE: A South Florida hospital chain is suspending elective surgeries and putting beds in conference rooms, an auditorium and even a cafeteria as many more patients seek treatment for Covid-19.
""We are seeing a surge like we've not seen before in terms of the patients coming,'' Memorial Healthcare System's chief medical officer Dr Marc Napp said Wednesday during a news conference in Hollywood.

Napp said they've opened up an additional 250 beds at Memorial's six hospitals in Broward County.
Unlike during last year's spring and summer Covid surges when many sick people tried to avoid hospitals for fear of catching the virus, patients suffering from other ailments are also seeking treatment now, Napp explained.

On Wednesday, there were more than 1,600 inpatients admitted for overnight stays across the system's facilities. Typically, the health system doesn't have more than about 1,400 inpatients under its care at a time.
""This is the highest number of patients Memorial has ever seen,'' he said. ""It's the sheer number coming in at the same time. There are only so many beds, so many doctors, only so many nurses,'' Napp said.
Across Florida, more than 12,000 patients were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Wednesday, and nearly 2,500 of them were in ICU beds. On Tuesday, the centers for disease control and prevention reported more than 50,000 new Covid-19 cases in Florida during a three-day span, raising the seven-day average to one of the highest counts since the pandemic began. In total, the state has seen more than 2.6 million cases and 39,179 deaths.
Governor Ron DeSantis has rejected calls to enforce CDC recommendations that nearly everyone wear masks indoors until vaccination rates increase significantly. The Republican leader says deciding whether to mask up or get the shots must remain an individual choice, and meanwhile it's important to keep Florida's economy moving.
""Florida is a free state, and we will empower our people. We will not allow Joe Biden and his bureaucratic flunkies to come in and commandeer the rights and freedoms of Floridians,'' DeSantis, who has been exploring the possibility of running for president in 2024, said in a fundraising email Wednesday night.
At Memorial, Napp said the patients being treated for Covid-19 are largely unvaccinated.
The Covid-19 vaccines were designed to prevent severe illness and death, and none are 100% effective, so public health experts have always expected a small number of ""breakthrough'' cases with milder infections among the vaccinated. Some of those sickened in this latest surge took all the necessary precautions.
Fort Lauderdale retirees Doug and Judi Custer said they did everything they were told to ward off the virus. They both got vaccinated and continued to wear masks at the grocery store, even when mandates were lifted.
So when Judi Custer, 75, got a sore throat a few weeks ago, she didn't think much of it. Even with the cough and fever, ""that never entered my mind that it could be Covid,'' she said.
Her 80-year-old husband also had a cough, chills and terrible headaches. So after a friend informed her that a few people they'd recently been in contact with tested positive, she got tested for Covid at an urgent care center, just to be safe. Her husband refused.
She was shocked when the test came back positive. Her husband's condition deteriorated rapidly. He struggled to breathe and spent five days in the hospital, where they put him on oxygen.
She started feeling better, but was concerned for her husband, a retired teacher. With hospitals now overcrowded, she was not allowed to visit him. Their daughter flew home to help.
""Continue to be cautious and careful and take all the measures you can. Even though you think you're immune to getting Covid, you're still vulnerable to it,'' she said in a phone interview.
""It's not just you if you choose not to get vaccinated,'' she said sitting beside her husband, who is still using oxygen and slowly regaining his strength. ""You are making it more difficult for other people, and to get us back to normalcy of life in our country.''
""The immunization is there. We've had it long enough to know it is helping people even if they get sick with it, like us you're less likely to be put on a ventilator, you're less likely to be hospitalized,'' she said. ""I wasn't hospitalized. You're less likely to get it as severe.''

Soothe Healthcare secures ₹ 130 crore Series C funding from leading PE fund A91 Partners,4056,"
Soothe Healthcare, a leading homegrown personal hygiene products company, today announced that it raised Series-C round of funding of ₹ 130 crore from A91 Partner Partners.
Soothe’s fast-growing feminine hygiene brand Paree has quickly established itself as a homegrown domestic leader in the feminine care category. Soothe will direct the new capital raised towards marketing activities and deepening distribution channels to achieve its goal of establishing Paree as a household brand in India. By leveraging on its core competence in feminine hygiene with Paree & its extensive distribution network, Soothe also launched its Baby Diaper brand Super Cute’s which has received overwhelmingly positive response from consumers.
Commenting on the funding, Sahil Dharia, Founder & CEO, Soothe Healthcare, said, ""Paree is among a select few offline brands to achieve a 100 Cr. top line in 4 years since launch. We have stayed focused on offering a great product with a good value proposition to become a trusted personal hygiene brand across the country. With this investment from A91 we’re on solid track to achieve our goal of a significant market share in the next few years.”
Soothe is a uniquely positioned omni-channel company leveraging both offline and D2C capability - deep distribution channels throughout India, modern trade, hypermarket stores and an online presence.
According to Abhay Pandey - General Partner - A91 Partners, ""Sahil has built Paree on a solid foundation of product and distribution focus. We believe that Paree will be among a few significant Indian brands in this underpenetrated segment. With complimentary products like Diapers, we see Soothe becoming a major player in the Personal Hygiene business in the next 5 years.”
The brand Paree was launched in 2018 through offline FMCG distribution channels. The young company has raised several rounds of investments from leading foreign institutional and domestic investors including London listed investment company, Symphony International Holdings Ltd. and Mumbai-based consumer fund, Sixth Sense Ventures amongst other backers.
The investment by A91 Partners included a secondary transaction with Sixth Sense Ventures. The secondary sale allowed for a successful exit for Sixth Sense Ventures’ first fund that had invested in Soothe. Sixth Sense continues to hold its investments from its second fund. Regarding the transaction, Nikhil Vora, Founder-CEO of Sixth Sense Ventures said “The journey of Soothe for Sixth Sense and me, personally, has been extremely gratifying. We were Soothe’s first investor and our belief of backing Sahil, the feminine hygiene space and the way the market has been addressed, has paid us rich dividends. In a category which is one of the most underpenetrated and yet completely duopolised, Paree has created its strong salience and indeed distribution. It’s rare to get into a category which has almost a 40-year lien on a consumer life cycle. We, at Sixth Sense continue to remain bullish on the absorbency category in India and Soothe in particular.”
Sunil Chandiramani, CEO of the Symphony Group said “We congratulate Sahil and the Soothe team on this milestone and welcome A91 as a new partner. The fresh capital, together with the high quality of Soothe’s management, will ensure the continued successful growth of the business to make it a leading domestic champion ”.

"Gurugram: Vaccination data of 12k health, frontline staff missing",2408,"GURUGRAM: The Gurugram health department does not have vaccination records of 12,000 recipients — categorised as healthcare and frontline workers — and has asked the private hospitals in the city to contact them and get clarity on their vaccination status.
According to the official data, there are 53,000 healthcare workers and 54,000 frontline workers registered in Gurugram. Of them, 1.07 lakh have been fully vaccinated while the inoculation status of 7,000 HCWs and 5,000 FLWs are yet to be updated.



The officials of the health department said that the remaining recipients might have taken the jab in different parts of the country. When the department carried out an investigation on the missing data, it observed that many workers have taken their jabs in other states or as the general public (not as HCW or FLW). It also found that many workers took the jab by registering from alternate mobile numbers.

“We have set August 15 as the deadline for healthcare and frontline workers in all private and government hospitals to get both the doses,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Also, the Haryana government has sought permission from the central government to delete the details of the recipients whose vaccination status is not updated on the Co-WIN portal yet.
The health department has formed a team to check all registered healthcare and frontline workers in the district department-wise. Every day, these teams will visit two departments to check the vaccination status of the recipients. The health department will also set up camps if needed, officials said.
Meanwhile, the district on Thursday will carry out vaccinations at 48 government facilities. As many as 45 Covishield sessions will be held while seven Covaxin and one Sputnik V session site will be set up.
On Wednesday, a total of 13,327 people in the 18-44 age group got inoculated. In the 45-plus category, a total of 3,199 people took the shots. As many as 643 healthcare staff and 152 frontline workers also received the jab.
Meanwhile, Gurugram witnessed nine fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday. The caseload now stands at 1,80,923, out of which 85 are active. The positivity rate stands at 0.1%. As many as 10 people also recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 1,79,919. The recovery rate stands at 99.6%. A total of 77 patients are in home isolation while eight are in hospitals.

Thousands of lives lost due to China's Covid cover-up: US Republican report,4598,"NEW DELHI: The Chinese government's ""lies, cover-up, and oppression of whistleblowers"" during the early days of Covid pandemic led to hundreds of thousands of fatalities around the world, said a recent report by the US Republicans.
The report, released on Monday, said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) concealed vital information about Covid-19 from the whole world, including their own people, following the outbreak in Wuhan in 2019.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

It pointed out several examples suggesting an elaborate cover-up such as CCP's repeated failure to notify the WHO of cases meeting the definition of SARS, its decision to not publish the Wuhan Institute of Virology's genetic mapping of SARS-CoV-2, the shutting down of the Shanghai lab that published the SARS-CoV-2 genome online and the lack of announcements about new cases during CCP political meetings between January 6-17 2020, among others.
The report said China had the information required to reduce its cases by at least 86% compared to the estimated caseload at the end of February.

Republican panel indicts China for virus leak as cases surge in US

WASHINGTON: Not that it ever went away, but the Covid-19 pandemic is back with a vengeance across the world, with renewed focus on China, which is again locking down towns and municipalities following fresh outbreaks. A report released by a US Republican Congressional Panel, citing copious open


Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the report by the panel's Republican staff.
It said that senior CCP leaders, including President Xi Jinping, knew a pandemic was ongoing weeks before it was announced.
""By responding in a transparent and responsible manner, the CCP could have supported the global public health response and shared information with the world about how to handle the virus. It is likely the ongoing pandemic could have been prevented had they done so, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and the world from an economic meltdown,"" it said.
On the other hand, CCP propagandists sought to sow disinformation and shift the blame away from their cover-up, the report said.
""As countries began to restrict travel, the CCP publicly and privately criticized them. In mid-February, the CCP revoked press credentials from Western news outlets that were actively covering the outbreak,"" the report said.
It said that most critically, the party, which has been ruling China for decades, manipulated case statistics throughout the outbreak in an effort to minimize the significance of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding number of cases.


""From the beginning, the CCP only allowed some symptomatic cases to be reported. Prior to mid-February, the CCP only reported cases that were symptomatic, clinically diagnosed, and confirmed by laboratory tests,"" the report said, adding that the policy was reversed only after March 31.
There have been several reports in foreign media about China underreporting its cases and deaths in the early days of the pandemic.
The Republican report said that Chinese officials even went as far as to claim that the virus originated outside China.
It cited a tweet by senior China foreign ministry official Lijian Zhao in March 2020 where he shared an article claiming the virus was brought into China by the US military.
The report also pointed out some ""disturbing examples"" of CCP harassing and detaining Chinese doctors who tried to warn others about the outbreak in the early days.
""Healthcare professionals in Wuhan were not the only ones subject to such treatment. On January 26th, the CCP’s Discipline Inspection Commission for Taizhou City Number Two People’s Hospital issued a notice regarding Li Min, a nurse at the hospital. Li was punished for discussing the Covid-19 outbreak with her classmates via WeChat and reprimanded for lacking the proper 'discipline',"" the report mentioned.
It recalled how Chinese authorities tried to ""cover up"" the 2003 SARS outbreak in a similar fashion.
""Similar to the early days of Covid-19, requests for access to the epicenter of the SARS outbreak were denied by the CCP. Even after the WHO was admitted, the cover-up continued; CCP officials went so far as to put SARS patients in hospital rooms and in ambulances driving around the city to hide them from the WHO,"" the report claimed.
It said the ""startling similarity"" in the CCP’s mishandling of the two outbreaks only adds to the evidence that the spread and impact of Covid-19 could have been prevented.

Gujarat Inc spends less than 1% of CSR funds on sports,2469,"AHMEDABAD: Even as homegrown Amul and Adani Group have joined as sponsors for the Indian contingent at the ongoing Olympic Games in Tokyo, sports receive less than 1% of the total corporate social responsibility (CSR) expenditure by Gujarat Inc.
Corporate companies in Gujarat spent about Rs 910 crore on various CSR projects in 2019-20, of which only Rs 1.86 crore went towards encouraging sports.



This was just 0.20% of the total CSR expenditure by 1,488 companies in 2019-20, according to the National Corporate Social Responsibility Data Portal, which is an initiative by the Union ministry of corporate affairs. Promotion of sports is among the various development sectors that have been identified for CSR expenditure.

In fact, the CSR amount spent to promote sports in Gujarat showed a drop of 28% in 2019-20 as against Rs 2.59 crore in the previous year. The total CSR expenditure of Rs 1,066 crore was recorded in 2018-19, the CSR portal data shows.
Cos prefer to spend on healthcare, education
While CSR expenditure data for the fiscal 2020-21 is yet to be collated, experts opine that CSR spending for sports is unlikely to increase.
Experts say that most companies utilized CSR funds for Covid-19 prevention and management during the year.


While local corporate firms have continued to sponsor sporting events and rope in sportsmen and athletes to endorse their brands, they prefer to spend majority of their CSR funds on sectors such as healthcare, education and rural development.
“CSR projects are generally curated on the basis of annual funding available, immediate societal needs and tangibility of the intervention,” said Bhomik Shah, founder and CEO, CSRBOX, an Ahmedabad-based CSR research and advisory firm.
“While education, healthcare and rural development projects fall in societal priorities and are tangible in nature, investing in sports requires sustained and continuous investment, which current CSR mandate does not encourage. It is not easy for a CSR head to pitch long gestation requirement projects to its top management,” he added.
Healthcare, education and rural development projects in Gujarat received CSR funds worth Rs 315 crore, Rs 296 crore and Rs 86 crore respectively in 2019-20.
Not just Gujarat, the trend is similar pan-India with promotion of sports getting Rs 263 crore of CSR funds, which is 1.2% of the total CSR expenditure of Rs 21,213 crore in 2019-20. The CSR spend also declined 11% in 2019-20 over 2018-19."
Raipur: Father saves 6-month-old daughter by donating a part of his liver,2196,"RAIPUR: In a unique case of liver transplant, a father saved his six months old daughter by donating a part of his liver in Raipur.
The six month-old baby Takshi was suffering from a severe liver condition called biliary atresia. It is a rare liver disease that causes jaundice in the liver and the infection continuously goes up leading to death.

The surgery has been performed in a private hospital under government healthcare scheme of Dr Khubchand Baghel Healthcare scheme and Chief Minister's Special Health Assistance Scheme.
A couple of Raipur, Love and Seema Sinha who were almost broken when Gastroenterologist Dr Ajeet Mishra diagnosed their 6-month-old daughter Takshi with a severe liver condition called biliary atresia.

Briefing over the only option of treatment, Dr Mishra told the couple that the child could be saved only through procedure of liver transplantation.
Hence, after the consultation session Takshi’s father decided to donate a part of his liver to save his daughter. The team of liver transplant surgeons including Dr Mohammad Abdun Nayeem and Dr Ajeet Mishra performed the surgery, and after the hard endeavors of 9 hours, this operation was made successful. This was the first of its kind case in Central India where a 6 months old had liver transplant surgery, claimed doctors Nayeem and Mishra.
In a press conference over success of challenging surgery of biliary atresia, managing director of hospital Dr Sandeep Dave said, “When the couple brought the child's her condition was critical and deteriorating every day. We had no other option than to plan transplantation. We really appreciate the spirit of her father Love Sinha, who decided to come ahead for donation. In this area, this spirit for a girl child is rare, this shows we are moving on the path of women empowerment and save daughters.""
Such cases in the area are very common in the kids but due to lack of awareness and resources, people most often lose the lives of their loved ones, said doctors.
The family was already under pressure of financial crises and availed government scheme to bear the cost of surgery. The child has recovered now and will be discharged in a few days, said Dr Dave.

Israel to offer Pfizer booster shot against Covid-19 to the over-60s,2556,"JERUSALEM: Israel will begin offering a third shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to people aged over 60, a world first in efforts to slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, a healthcare provider and Israeli media said on Thursday.
Those eligible will be able to get the booster shot starting on Sunday as long as they received their second dose more than five months ago, Maccabi Healthcare Services said in a statement that confirmed reports on Channel 13 TV and Kan public radio.

Israel was a world leader in the vaccination rollout, with many seniors getting their shots in December, January and February as they were regarded as the most vulnerable sector of the population.
But since the emergence of the Delta variant, the health ministry has twice reported a drop in the vaccine's efficacy against infection and a slight decrease in its protection against severe disease.

The booster campaign, due to be launched by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at a news conference later in the day, will effectively turn Israel into a testing ground for a third dose before approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Pfizer said on Wednesday it believes people need the additional dose to keep protection against the coronavirus high. The company says it could apply for US emergency authorization for booster shots as early as August.
A panel of Israeli vaccination experts advising the health ministry gave approval for the campaign late on Wednesday.
Maccabi, one of Israel's largest healthcare providers, said in its statement that eligible patients were welcome to schedule their vaccination appointment via the Internet or its call centre.
Last week, the health ministry estimated the Pfizer vaccine was only 41% effective at halting symptomatic infections over the past month. Protection against severe disease remained strong at 91%.
Some experts have criticised the ministry's analysis because of possible bias that could be skewing the data. Others said Israel should wait a little longer to receive more information about the safety and effectiveness of a third shot.
Around 57% of Israel's 9.3 million population has been vaccinated. Around 160 people are hospitalised with severe symptoms and daily new infections have spiked to more than 2,000, up from a handful of cases per day a few months ago.
The cabinet is hoping that the vaccines will allow it to avoid costly lockdowns by protecting those most vulnerable from severe illness.

Cost of data breach hits record-high due to Covid,1699,"BENGALURU: Cost of data breaches for companies have soared to $4.2 million per incident across the globe, the highest in 17 years, as per an IBM report.
Based on analysis of real-world data breaches experienced by over 500 organisations, the study suggests that security incidents became more costly and harder to contain due to drastic operational shifts during the pandemic, with costs rising 10% compared to the prior year.

While the pandemic made it compulsory for most to shift to remote working conditions and other cloudbased activities, the pace of security advancement could not keep pace with the transformation.
“While data breach costs reached a record high over the past year, the report also showed positive signs about the impact of modern security tactics, such as AI, automation and the adoption of a zero-trust approach – which may pay off in reducing the cost of these incidents further down the line,” said Chris McCurdy, VP & GM in IBM Security.

In India, the average total cost of data breach was Rs 16.5 crore, an increase of 18% compared to 2020. The cost per lost or stolen record was Rs 5,900, up about 7%.
Breaches cost over $1 million more on average when remote work was indicated as a factor in the event, compared to those in this group without this factor ($4.9 million vs $3.8 million). The report adds that healthcare, retail and hospitality, those which faced huge operational challenges during the pandemic, also experienced a substantial increase in data breach costs year over year. Healthcare was the worst hit, with breaches costing $9.2 million, up from $7.2 million a year earlier.

Covid-19: High daily cases worry Bhubaneswar despite 72% population vaccinated,1224,"BHUBANESWAR: The capital city has been grappling with a high daily rise in infections, but its vaccination pace has been exceedingly good with 72% of its target population having taken both the jabs.
Healthcare experts feel that containing the breakthrough (infection of vaccinated people) infection, strengthening of enforcement activities, checking cluster spread through micro containment and protecting the 0-18 age group of people are ways forward to reduce the impact of the second wave and rule out the possibility of a third one.

Throughout July, the city has been adding more than 300 cases daily. On Wednesday, however, it reported 182 new infections against 175 recoveries. This took the active cases to 2,062. The city accounts for close to half of Khurda’s 4500 active cases.
“We need to ensure that the floating population of the city doesn’t spread the infection. Most importantly, the fully vaccinated people should not lower their guard,” Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said.

On Wednesday, the state added 1703 new Covid cases registering a test positivity rate of 2.16, down from 2.59% a day earlier.
The government also confirmed 69 more Covid deaths taking the toll to 5,703.

Cognizant posts record-high attrition in April-June quarter even as revenue growth picks up,3531,"CHENNAI: IT major Cognizant on Thursday posted 12% revenue growth year-on-year in constant currency terms and around 4.5% in sequential terms for the April-June quarter.
Even as the company beat street estimates in terms of revenue growth and increased its outlook for the year, a hot tech job market is impacting the IT bellwether adversely as it reported life-time high attrition levels in the quarter.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

Quarterly annualised attrition stood at 31% compared to 21% in the previous quarter and 24% in the same quarter last year. Further, voluntary attrition (annualised) stood at 29% compared to 18% in March and 11% in the same period last year.
At a revenue of $4.6 billion and growth of 12% in the quarter, the company's performance lags rivals such as TCS and Infosys for the comparable period. TCS posted almost 19% YoY revenue growth (CC terms) and Infosys revenues grew around 16% in the quarter.

Cognizant's net income was at $512 million up only marginally from $505 million in the last quarter but a jump from $361 million it made in the same period last year.
""We delivered a strong second quarter,"" Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said. ""Through targeted investments, we've been shifting our portfolio to faster-growing market segments while extending our capabilities and partnerships to help clients build modern businesses. I see a stronger, more competitive Cognizant emerging, with growing commercial momentum. We are bullish on the industry and our prospects within it.""
Commenting on the attrition in the conference call with analysts, Humphries said: ""We've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen or our team has seen over the last 10-plus years.""
Cognizant's revenue from financial services increased approximately by 5%. Healthcare revenue increased 13%, and products and resources revenue grew 18%. Digital revenue grew approximately 20% year-over-year.
Buoyed by improved performance, Cognizant increased its revenue guidance for the full year 2021. The company expects 2021 revenue at $18.4-$18.5 billion; i.e., 9-10% growth in CC terms, compared to 5.5%-7.5% growth it guided to in the last quarter. However, this outlook factors in favourable impact from currency movements of 120 basis points (100 basis points = 1%) and approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue.
""Second quarter top-line results exceeded our guidance, driven by improved demand for our services and momentum in our digital revenue, and we increased our full-year 2021 revenue growth to 10.2-11.2%,"" Cognizant CFO Jan Siegmund said. ""To meet the strong client demand for our services, we have continued to scale our recruiting capabilities and invest in our people.
Despite record attrition, in the April-June quarter, Cognizant crossed the 300,000 employees mark for the first time in its history with the majority of the employees in India.
""We now expect to hire approximately 100,000 laterals in 2021 and to train close to 100,000 associates. In addition, we expect to onboard approximately 30,000 new graduates in 2021 and make 45,000 offers to new graduates in India for 2022 onboarding,"" Humphries said on the earnings call.
The company also said it has currently vaccinated 160,000 of its associates and families and set up nearly 1,000 Covid-19 hospital beds for communities in India.

Kerala government tells private hospitals to fast-track vaccinations,3135,"KOCHI: On one hand, the state government’s vaccination drive has come to a standstill due to unavailability of Covid vaccines, while on the other, over 6 lakh vaccines are still available with private hospitals in the state. The state government has now written to private hospitals to use up their vaccine stocks to ensure that the state gets its vaccine quota.
The Kerala government is planning to administer at least the first dose to maximum beneficia- ries before Onam on August 21, Dr Rathan Kelkar, executive director of state health agency (SHA) has stated in a letter to the private hospitals.

“In order to demand more vaccine from GoI (Government of India), the state has to utilize the maximum of received vaccines. In this scenario, it is requested that all hospitals have to schedule more number of sessions and administrate maximum number of doses per day,” he said in the letter. There are around 29,040 doses of Covaxin and 6,66,345 doses of Covishield unused in 106 private hospitals. The letter, sent on July 26 — when vaccine stock in government hospitals here exhausted — further added that the Centre is monitoring vaccination details like daily vaccination count, balance stock etc., of hospitals and has requested the state government to “administrate the maximum of private hospitals stock as soon as possible”.
A private hospital, on average, vaccinates around 300-500 persons, with large hospitals vaccinating 700 plus persons by organizing special camps. After implementation of GoI’s new vaccination policy in May 2021, so far, private hospitals have administered 12,24,599 doses.

Sources said that despite vaccine shortage in government hospitals, there is a reluctance among people to get vaccinated at a private hospital. “This is due to the cost factor involved. Many are willing to wait for free vaccine provided by the government,” said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and MD, KIMS Healthcare Group and president of Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter). While Covaxin is priced at Rs1,410 in a private hospital, it is Rs 780 for Covishield.
However, private hospital managements are unable to understand the connection between vaccine availability in private hospitals and the state demanding more vaccines. With the new vaccination policy, private hospitals have to directly procure 25% vaccine quota from manufacturers on advance payment. Vaccines for small private hospitals, procuring less than 6,000 doses, will be distributed by the state.
“Private hospitals get their 25% vaccine quota once a month, while the state gets its vaccine stock from the Centre every week depending on their 75% vaccine usage the previous week. There is no connection between vaccines received for the government and private hospitals,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.
“Some small and medium private hospitals received their vaccine stock only two days back,” said Dr Joseph Benaven, secretary, Kerala Private Hospitals Association.

Chinchinim health centre completes home jab drive,1161,"Colva: Chinchinim primary health centre vaccinated 46 bedridden and octogenarians in the past three days within its jurisdiction.
The centre inoculated 11 on Monday, 18 on Tuesday and 17 on Wednesday, concluding its three-day drive.

Senior health staff members said that they sent letters to panchayats in its area to alert bedridden persons or those who cannot make it to the centre for vaccination. The centre also provided a ‘Whatsapp’ number for registration of names.
Accordingly, after receiving the registrations, they chalked out the route to inoculate the persons within four hours of opening a vial. Villages of Sarzora, Ambelim, Chinchinim, Varca, Orlim, Carmona and Cavelossim come under the jurisdiction of Chinchinim health centre.

Eleven individuals can be administered a jab with one vial within the stipulated time beyond which it becomes ineffective.
The persons who had registered for the drive were told that the visiting staff would not be able to stay back to monitor the beneficiary for 30 minutes after the vaccine was administered so as to curtail wastage of vaccines.
The staff said that they received a good response for the drive.

Blood clots in people with severe Covid-19 linked to abnormal antibody response: Study,2705,"LONDON: Inflammation and blood clotting seen in very severe cases of Covid-19 may be caused by the antibodies sent to fight the disease triggering unnecessary platelet activity in the lungs, according to a study published on Wednesday.
The researchers, including those from Imperial College London in the UK, also found that it was possible to reduce or stop platelets from responding in this way by treating blood with active ingredients from different drugs known to either inhibit platelet function or immune responses.

This is a modal window.

The study, published in the journal Blood, shows how antibodies produced by our bodies to protect against Covid-19 are activating increased function of platelets, which may be causing fatal blood clots in patients with severe disease.
Platelets are small cells found in the blood which form clots to stop or prevent bleeding, but abnormal platelet function can lead to serious health concerns such as strokes and heart attacks.

""Until now, we have only had assumptions about why platelets involved in clotting were being activated during Covid-19 infection,"" said Professor Jon Gibbins, from the University of Reading in the UK.
""The antibodies that are produced to stop Covid-19 from spreading trigger infected cells to induce platelet activity which causes clotting even though there is no wound that needs healing,"" Gibbins said.
In the latest study, the researchers took antibodies produced to fight the coronavirus's spike protein, from people with severe Covid-19 infections, and cloned them in a laboratory.
The spike protein helps the SARS-COV-2 virus to infect and enter the human cells.
The researchers found that the small sugars found on the surface of these antibodies were different from antibodies from healthy individuals.
When they introduced those cloned antibodies in a lab to blood cells taken from healthy donors, there was an observed increase in platelet activity.
The study suggests that it may be possible for drugs that are currently used to treat immune system problems to reduce or stop the cells from developing an exaggerated platelet response.
A trial led by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is already testing these drugs in clinical trials with patients at hospital sites across the UK to see whether they will reduce serious clotting for hospitalised Covid-19 patients, the researchers said.
The study of platelets in the laboratory establishes important mechanisms that explain how and why dangerous blood clots may occur in severely ill Covid-19 patients, and importantly, also provides clues as to how this may be prevented, they added.

The government has released an email address — padmaawards.delhi@gmail.com — for submitting the suggestions.
People can send in their recommendations by August 15 with a description of why they think the person named deserves the honour. The names would be checked by a “Search and Screening Committee” headed by deputy CM Manish Sisodia to decide the final list of nominations. Recently, Kejriwal had written to PM Narendra Modi seeking Bharat Ratna for doctors and healthcare workers.

“This decision has been taken to honour the service and sacrifice of the medical community during the Covid-19 crisis. We have asked the people of Delhi for the nominations as they are the ones who actually know the most about the dedication and hard work of our doctors,” the CM said, while thanking doctors and healthcare workers for relentlessly giving everything they could to save lives during one of the biggest crises seen by humanity.
Every year, the country honours a select few with Bharat Ratna and Padma awards. The central government gives these awards to people who have showcased excellent work in their field. For all three Padma awards, the Centre asks people to nominate figures who they think deserve the honour. State governments are also asked to nominate such personalities.
Expressing his heartfelt gratitude, Kejriwal said, “During the pandemic, doctors, healthcare workers and paramedical staff helped save a lot of lives. They served humanity with impeccable commitment. I know many doctors and healthcare workers who did not go home for days. I also know many doctors and healthcare workers who got infected while tending to patients and were, unfortunately, martyred on duty.”
“The entire humanity is indebted to such doctors. No matter how much we thank them, it won’t suffice for their sacrifice. Delhi government is the only government in the country that gave a Samman Rashi of Rs 1 crore to frontline workers who were martyred on duty,” added the CM.

Appearing for NGO 'Jan Swasthya Abhiyan', senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said with the focus shifting from strengthening the public sector healthcare system to private sector, only 30% of patients get treatment from government owned hospitals and healthcare centres. With privatisation of the healthcare system, the patients are getting fleeced by the private hospitals and clinics as there is no enforcement of the Clinical Establishment Act of 2010 and the relevant Rules framed in 2012.

TIMES VIEW

Displaying rate charts is the law which many private hospitals flout. We need strict monitoring to ensure that the law is duly followed. Violators should be punished.



Parikh said the Union government, in consultation with states, is yet to frame and notify ""conditions for registrations: minimum standards of facilities and services; minimum requirement of personnel; provisions of maintenance of records and reporting; fixation of rates for each type of procedure and services within the range of rates determined by the central government issued from time to time.""
He said in the absence of framing and notifying the minimum standards, the clinical establishments in 17 states and UTs are operating on the basis of provisional registration.
The PIL, filed through advocate Srishti Agnihotri, sought a direction to the Centre to ""operationalise all the provisions of the 2010 Act and 2012 Rules, and among others, direct that the conditions for registration which include the observance of minimum standards, display and observance of determined rates for procedures and services.”

Education shares continued to slide on Tuesday, with New Oriental Education & Technology Group Co falling 8.63%, taking its drop over the last three sessions to more than 70%, while the CSI education index tumbled 4.97%.
Worst-case scenario
Anita Chu, an analyst at CCB International, said in a research report that the unfavourable regulatory environment could force firms to spin off after-school tutoring operations or even delist, and issued a downgrade and reduced the target price for New Oriental.
""According to our estimates, the potential spinoff of (after-school tutoring) operations would take 60-70% off the earnings of New Oriental and 80-90% off (New York-listed) TAL Education.""
In Hong Kong, heavily indebted developer China Evergrande Group extended its losses, spiralling 13.41% lower to end at 4-1/2 year lows, after the company said it would cancel a special dividend proposal.
The broader property sector in Hong Kong dropped 2.55% and real estate A-shares ended 4.51% lower.
Adding to broader concerns about the economic outlook, profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for a fourth straight month in June, as high raw material prices weighed on factories' margins.
A surge in highly contagious Delta variant Covid-19 cases centred on the eastern city of Nanjing also spurred fresh worries on Tuesday.

"Aon, Willis halt $30 billion merger over monopoly concerns, delay",4805,"NEW DELHI: Aon Plc and Willis Towers Watson Plc on Monday called off a $30 billion merger that would have created the world's largest insurance broker, saying US regulators' objections created unacceptable delay and uncertainty.
The decision, hailed by some as an early victory for the Biden administration's Department of Justice, which sued last month to block it, stood at odds with European regulators who recently approved the deal on condition the companies sell assets. Those now-halted sales largely affect broker Arthur J Gallagher & Co.

Combining Aon and Willis, which rank second and third in revenue behind Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc, would have created a new leader with $20.3 billion in annual revenue, compared with $17.2 billion for Marsh.
Aon will pay Willis a $1 billion termination fee, the timing and financial impact of which was not immediately clear. Aon reports second-quarter results on Friday. Willis said on Monday it would boost share repurchases by $1 billion.

""Despite regulatory momentum around the world ... we reached an impasse with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Aon Chief Executive Greg Case said in a statement.
US Attorney General Merrick Garland called the termination ""a victory"" because employers ""rely on insurance brokers like Aon and Willis Towers Watson for managing the complexities of these health and retirement benefits,"" he said.
Aon declined to comment. Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Aon's shares were up 9.6% at $254.72, while Willis Towers' stock fell 9% to $205.93 in New York trading.
Timing issues
Though the DOJ argued the combination would broadly reduce competition and lead to higher prices, US District Judge Reggie Walton last week narrowed the trial scope to two issues: whether large US companies would be worse off when buying property, casualty and financial risk coverage; and health-and-benefit coverage for employees.
Walton, who has been assigned criminal cases related to the January 6 US Capitol attack, warned that those could be heard before the Aon-Willis-DOJ suit, which risked further delaying the deal's approval.
""Since some of (the defendants) are incarcerated, their rights to a speedy trial are going to have to take precedent,"" Walton said at a July 6 hearing.
A lengthy court process of possibly nine months would push the deal's closure well into 2022, and that posed too much risk, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Solving the remaining DOJ issues also posed a threat to customers and employees because the businesses are not organized by client size, making selling parts difficult, the source said.
""If we had tried to separate out large clients, we would have broken up books of business,"" the source said, referring to portfolios of policies. This would raise concerns about whether account executives would need to leave Aon with the policies that were sold, or would remain with Aon but lose customers.
""The companies were not able to come to an agreement with the DOJ that made economic sense for them,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome. ""I don't think it's more complicated than that.""
Broader implications
The DOJ had also alleged the combination would reduce competition in reinsurance broking, retirement and pension planning and private retiree multi-carrier healthcare exchanges. But the sides had begun finalizing settlement on those issues.
In a video to Aon employees, Case said: ""The DOJ position is remarkably out of step with the rest of the global regulatory community and we were confident that we would win in court.""
The halted divestitures included Aon's U.S. retirement unit, US retiree healthcare exchange and its retirement business in Germany, along with Willis's global reinsurance business.
Aon also said it had extended by three years the employment contracts of Case and Chief Financial Officer Christa Davies, through April 1, 2026, to provide stability.
Some saw the DOJ's victory as a sign of a new tone in Washington. ""I applaud Attorney General Garland for his commitment to addressing America's monopoly problem by stopping consolidation and aggressively enforcing the antitrust laws,"" David Cicilline, chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement.
Broader implications were felt by companies in the midst of large deals that could also attract the DOJ's antitrust gaze.
Discovery Inc pared gains to 1.9% after jumping 10% in early trading. The media firm announced in May a $43 billion combination with AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia.
Kansas City Southern dipped 1.2%. The railroad operator agreed to be acquired by Canadian National Railway , although the Biden administration has shipping costs in the sector in its anticompetitive sights.

Rise in mental illness cases a worry but Telangana lacks doctors,2282,"HYDERABAD: State health authorities have said that the increasing cases of mental health issues amid the pandemic are a ticking time bomb as the state has only a small pool of mental health professionals to deal with the situation.
Telangana has an estimated 200 to 250 trained mental health professionals and just 20 hospitals in 10 districts outside Hyderabad.

“Most of these hospitals are run by individual psychiatrists and have a capacity of 5 to 10 beds. Within Hyderabad, there are around 10 hospitals, at least a few of which are bigger centres including the Institute of Mental Health, Erragadda. Also, some of the hospitals are primarily de-addiction centres,” said Dr V Rakesh, president, Telangana Aarogyasri Network Hospitals Association (TANHA).
The problem is expected to grow over the next two years and despite efforts, state authorities admit that it is a cause for concern. “The most serious problem now is mental health issue. It has surpassed all other post Covid-19 complications. It is a cause for serious concern as symptoms start within three months of getting infected and might last up to two years. We are trying to put certain systems in place. Healthcare workers will try to asses both physical and mental health status whenever they visit households. Even people who are coming to hospitals are being assessed and special psychiatric clinics have been established in districts for the purpose,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director, public health, Telangana.

The state health department had previously identified nearly 90 psychiatrists (doctors and resident doctors) in government hospitals to deal with the problem.
Meanwhile, doctors seeing Covid-19 patients say that the impact on mental health is being seen in 80% of the patients although many patients continue to resist treatment due to the stigma attached to seeking help for mental health issues. “Patients in ICU are the worst affected as every death around them leaves an imprint on them. Many cry endlessly and slip into depression within a day of being admitted. Even when they are cured and return for assessment, they continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression,” said a resident doctor at Gandhi Hospital.

Responding to an appeal made by Curtortim MLA Alexio Reginald Laurenco for upgradation of the Curtorim primary health centre, Rane said that the file pertaining to the proposal has gone to the finance department for appointment of a consultant and that the matter would be “fast-tracked”.
He also stressed on the need for expansion of other PHCs where land is available for the purpose so that more facilities could be introduced and newer diagnostic equipment installed.

Lauding the nurses, para-medical and multi-tasking staff for the commendable job they did in taking care of the patients during the pandemic, Rane further said that it would be government’s endeavour to regularise the services of the contractual employees.
“We will never use the policy of use and throw. Such a policy should be discarded. The state government will take care of its Covid warriors. In the next 3-4 months, we will sort out the issue,” he said.

People’s movement in Assolna combating vaccine hesitancy,2488,"Panaji: A people’s movement to combat vaccine hesitancy has been gaining momentum in Assolna where the panchayat, church, medical fraternity and volunteers have been working together to ensure lives are saved during the pandemic.
The village has been working systematically since last month to get its residents, especially the most vulnerable, vaccinated. Regular meetings are held online to clear misconceptions about the vaccine and to work out strategies to ensure no one is left out.

The panchayat has also been distributing ‘Vaccinated Assolnekar’ badges to vegetable and fish vendors who have taken the jab.
Sarpanch Xavier Almeida said certificates/posters are distributed to shopkeepers, commercial establishments and restaurants where all the staff has been vaccinated.

These specially designed certificates ‘Welcome to Safe Shopping- All Who work here are Vaccinated’ and ‘Vaccinated-Welcome to safe restaurant- All those who work here are vaccinated- Keep Assolna Healthy and Covid free’ which are pasted at the premises, act as an assurance to customers and promote the vaccination message, he said.
The most difficult task for the team was establishing the baseline data of the resident population and finding out how many of them have been vaccinated. They also took it upon themselves to get those who come into the village for work, vaccinated and have been taking into account youth who have just turned 18 and even that of tenants living in the village.
Assolna resident and volunteer Simitra Rodrigues said the parish pastoral council collected information of the resident population, noting down those vaccinated, Covid positive and reasons for not taking the vaccine, and have been working together with panch members, who are mapping these against the electoral rolls to ensure nobody is missed. They have also found that around 6.4% of the population tested positive recently and will have to wait till they are eligible to take the vaccine.
Dr Ira Almeida and Dr Nickson Fernandes at the primary health centre Chinchinim have been supporting the vaccination drives.
Parish priest of Assolna church, Fr Sertorio Rodrigues has been sending out WhatsApp messages to the faithful in Konkani motivating them to take the jab and protect themselves. Some are hesitant and others afraid, he said.
“I tell them that if they don’t get vaccinated, we won’t be able to open our church,” he told TOI.

Elaborating on the findings of the survey, the business head of TimesJobs and TechGig Sanjay Goyal said: “The world is grappling with Covid-19 and its aftermaths on businesses and the society at large. The second (and more intense) wave jolted many businesses, slowing their operations and workforce plans. Hence, everyone is preparing to deal with the impending third wave more cautiously.""

Karnataka: Study launched to analyse jab effect on pandemic,3292,"BENGALURU: The health and family welfare department has launched a study on the vaccination status of those who died of Covid-19 from March 1 this year. Karnataka recorded 23,820 Covid deaths since March 1 till date, the state’s daily Covid bulletins show.
The pan-Karnataka study will factor in 85 parameters including vaccine type, number of doses taken, comorbidities suffered, date of onset of symptoms and the date of admission among others.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

The aim of the study is to examine the impact the vaccine has had on the pandemic. The vaccination drive began on January 16 across India. Healthcare workers were jabbed first and, gradually, the drive was extended to others beginning with frontline workers in February. The study zeroed in on March 1 as the date of commencement as it marked 44 days since the vaccination drive began. Also, from March 1 onwards, vaccination of senior citizens began in the state.
“Deaths among unvaccinated people and those who took the vaccine is what needs to be analysed,” officials said. The study also aims to cover those who needed to be treated in ICU and patients who needed ventilator support despite taking the shot.

KV Thrilok Chandra, commissioner, health and family welfare department, said there won’t be a cut-off date for the study. It will be an open-ended process.
However, the research team says it’s facing several problems due to errors in data compilation. “In many places, even now phone numbers at the time of testing are of staff collecting samples or those working at primary health centres. Cross-checking the data is difficult if phone numbers do not belong to patients,” health officials said. Multiple entries also bear the same name.
“In about 5-8% of cases, there is duplication of either name or contact number. We are in the process of crosschecking vaccination status of the victims through district administrations,” officials said. They insist the exercise is not just a death audit but goes beyond that.
Some officials believe the study should ideally include people who died from April 15 onwards. “The vaccine takes at least 28 days to produce immunogenicity. Considering the slow pace of vaccination in the initial months coupled with vaccine hesitancy, we should consider deaths that occurred post April 15 to understand the impact of vaccination,” an official said.
Once researchers freeze on preliminary findings, the data on people who died despite being vaccinated will again be cross-checked with district authorities, officials said.
BMCRI TO CONDUCT SURVEY
Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, which houses one of the largest dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, will conduct a similar study on deaths. The objective is to find out how many patients who were admitted between April 1 and May 31 were vaccinated, the doses of vaccines they had taken, the gap between the date of vaccination and test positivity and admission.
Confirming the study, Dr Smitha S Segu, nodal officer for Covid-19 management, BMCRI, said there were more than 3,000 patients admitted in BMCRI during April and May, the peak months of the second wave. The hospital had captured vaccination status of patients when they were admitted, the institute said.

"Karnataka: Covid cases dip, load off healthcare system",3357,"BENGALURU: With the daily incidence of Covid-19 steadily declining, and remaining below the 2,000-mark consistently for the past six days, the pressure on the healthcare system has come down. Oxygen consumption has fallen and in hospitals across the state, non-Covid care is back on track.
Covid-19 cases in Karnataka had peaked on May 5, crossing 50,000 for the first time in the second wave. Of the 50,112 cases reported from across the state, 23,106 were from Bengaluru alone. On July 10, the state reported 1,978 fresh cases, and the daily spike has remained below 2,000 since then. On Friday, the state reported 1,806 cases.

Across 1,222 Covid-19 hospitals in the state, 6,399 patients were on oxygen support and 165 kilolitre of medical oxygen was used on July 14. Contrast this to consumption during the Covid peak in early May: the state required more than 700 KL of medical oxygen daily.
The decline in Covid-19 cases has brought huge relief to healthcare staff.

Hosps stepping up non-Covid care
Doctors say besides sparing them the stress of dealing with the uncertainty of the disease and its progression in patients, they can now breathe free, quite literally, without having to wear PPE suits for long hours. With the viral load reducing, private and government hospitals are stepping up non-Covid care that was hitherto restricted to emergency only.
At St John’s Medical College Hospital, in the past month, the number of Covid patients seeking beds has drastically reduced compared to the surge seen in May, says chief of medical services Dr Sanjiv Lewin. Currently, the hospital has 41 patients and 25% of them are in the ICU. The hospital has currently shut nine huge wards dedicated to Covid.
“In the second wave, we had both Covid and non-Covid services going on. Even during the peak, we had 700 non-Covid patients seeking consultation in the outpatient unit. Now the OPD footfall is no less than 1,200 a day,” said Lewin. Some of the hospital’s doctors have also taken a short break from work, including one who has travelled to Himalayas, after Covid cases declined. The head of a 100-bed hospital in west Bengaluru told TOI that it was the high demand for medical oxygen that made Covid management tough in the second wave.
At Victoria Hospital, while non-Covid outpatient services began on July 15, admissions are likely to begin in a week.
Dr KC Gurudev, president of Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, says the number of Covid admissions has dropped drastically. The recent admission, he said, was of six members from a doctor’s family, while there is only one patient in ICU.
“We have not had any admissions in Covid ICU for the last 10 days. There are 30 Covid patients at our memorial hospital and medical college hospital together,” he said. Recalling more than 100 enquiries a day for ICU admission a couple of months ago, Gurudev said those days were the most stressful. The hospital currently has nearly 400 non-Covid in-patients.
While cases decline, doctors are counting the days of respite. At the back of their minds, they admit, is fear of a potential third wave. “The concern is that our medical college hospital will become a Covid hospital again and our medicos’ non-Covid treatment experience will suffer again,” says Dr Smitha S Segu of of BMCRI.

Times Face-off: Should India adopt compulsory vaccinations for the greater good?,9851,"Many countries are fighting vaccine hesitancy with mandates. Should India too adopt compulsory vaccinations for the greater good?
For: Dr. H Sudarshan Ballal

Mandatory vaccinations can be a game-changer in war against Covid
The coronavirus pandemic is like no other pandemic that we have witnessed in the last hundred years. The second wave in particular was catastrophic, snatching lives and livelihoods.

During the first wave, the effort was to control the pandemic by encouraging masking, social distancing, hand washing, avoiding crowds etc. Unfortunately, the utter disregard for Covid-appropriate behaviour by the public led to a lockdown which had a devastating effect on the economy.
Now the advent of vaccines has added another very powerful tool in our fight against Covid-19. While efforts to implement Covid-appropriate behaviour should continue, our best bet of controlling this pandemic is mass vaccinations as soon as possible.
However, even after six months of the vaccination program, only about 5% of the population has been fully vaccinated. Much of the public discussion regarding the slow pace of vaccinations has centered around supply-side barriers like shortage of vaccines, lack of infrastructure, logistics and equitable access to vaccines. Demand-side barriers like vaccine hesitancy, especially in the rural population, are less debated. Even before the emergence of Covid-19, WHO recognised vaccine hesitancy as one of the 10 leading threats to global health.


In India, misguided hesitancy and fake information about vaccines are a substantial threat to the elimination of the pandemic and achieving herd immunity against the infection.
This is counter-productive because it will lead to vulnerable people getting infected. The higher the infections, the greater the chance of mutations and spread of the resistant strain.
So the billion-dollar question is: Should we make vaccinations mandatory universally or at least in a select group of people or leave it as a choice for citizens to decide?


In general when we consider mandatory vaccinations, there are certain caveats that we need to fulfill...
1. Is there a need for the vaccination to achieve an important goal which can be a health or economic goal or both?
In this instance, the goal could be achieving herd immunity, protecting the vulnerable, protecting the capacity of the healthcare system and, of course, preventing the devastation of lockdowns.
2. Safety, efficacy and public interest
Certainly any option which interferes with individual liberty and choice should be considered only if it decreases the risk of morbidity, mortality and spread of the disease with unequivocal public health benefits. Clinical trials and ongoing monitoring show that vaccinated people are much less at risk of developing severe disease than unvaccinated people. Mortality is a rarity in fully vaccinated individuals. We also have enough evidence to show that all the currently available vaccines are by and large quite safe with hardly any serious side-effects.
3. Logistics of supply and public trust In addition to mandating vaccinations, we need to ensure sufficient supply, logistics to maintain the supply chain and have infrastructure to vaccinate all the eligible population. Building public trust through ethical, transparent sharing of scientific data at various fora and engaging the relevant stakeholders to understand their perspectives is also necessary.
Let’s look at some of the specific areas of mandatory vaccinations:
Healthcare and other frontline workers: In addition to preventing healthcare workers from getting the infection, it is very essential that caregivers “do no harm” by spreading their infection to the people they are taking care of.
Schools: Given the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines for children, we cannot at present recommend vaccination for children as a mandate to attend school. However, all teachers and other adult personnel in the school should be vaccinated both to prevent infections spreading to them or them spreading infections to children.
The Public: Vaccines are extremely powerful tools to fight viruses and we have seen tremendous successes in the past like eradication of smallpox and polio due to effective vaccination and a significant decrease in many childhood illnesses by routine vaccinations. Vaccination mandates for the general adult population are rare but this is an extraordinary situation that requires extraordinary measures. I do believe mandatory vaccination of everyone, subject to availability of vaccines, should be our priority. It will certainly be a game-changer in our war against Covid-19. Our fight against the coronavirus is akin to a warlike emergency. In a war people can be conscripted to serve the country with the risk of death or permanent injury. If people can be sent to war against their wishes with significant risks, I believe some level of coercion for vaccination with hardly any risks is justified in our war against this deadly virus

Covid situation does not warrant the sacrifice of individual liberties
Enemy planes were bombing London night after night. A group of Londoners demanded their right to keep the lights on. They argued that personal liberty must always be protected — what’s the use of winning a war at the cost of citizens’ liberties? Some supposed that these people must be civil liberty champions, and some suspected them to be enemy sympathisers. Irrespective of motivation, it was a classic case of personal liberty versus the public good.
Take a different example of the tension between individual rights and public interest. Until recently, the Indian state could acquire land for a public project without consent from any of the landowners. The public good, the eminent domain powers of the state, summarily trumped individual property rights. The reformed land acquisition act now requires that 80% of the landowners must consent. If the 80% voluntarily agree to sell their land at the offered price, then the remaining 20% could be compelled to sell their land.


Today, the media and the drawing rooms are abuzz with the debate over whether the Covid vaccine should be made compulsory — a new case of personal liberty versus public good. Is the Covid vaccine situation similar to the aerial night bombing of London or the new land acquisition scenario?
In the case of the night bombing, even a few lights could help guide enemy planes to their right target. Nothing sort of full compliance is necessary. And even the staunchest libertarians would find it difficult to defend the right to keep the lights on. However, the success of the Covid vaccine does not require each and everyone to be vaccinated, just enough numbers to achieve herd immunity. The vaccine situation is less like the night bombing, and more like the land acquisition scenario.
The key difference between night bombing and land acquisition is to whom we entrust the power to define the public good. In the night bombing case, it seems reasonable to let the state define the public good. The citizens abide by the state’s assessment of what constitutes the public good and follow its instructions—all of you/ us keep the lights off.
In the land acquisition case, the old law did give the full authority to the state to define the public good and compelled the public to follow its orders. The history and the experience of the old law, coupled with the changes in our democratic and social values, led to the realisation that in these situations, the public should have the right to define the public good. At least 80% of the affected individuals should agree that the government’s proposed project is in the public interest. This shift in power from the state to the people is indeed revolutionary.
An even bigger revolution is that the power is given to specific individuals and not to the general public. It is not the will of the people a la Rousseau but the flesh-and-blood individuals who get to determine the public good. This is real-life individual liberty.
Now let’s complete the triangle with the Covid vaccine. In the land acquisition case, we do compel the 20% of the affected individuals to follow the decision of the 80%. Do we need to follow this logic for the Covid vaccine also?
The answer is rather straightforward. No vaccine has been made compulsory — not polio, not hepatitis, not diphtheria (DTP). In real life, we need herd immunity, and that is achieved with less than 80%.
This nuanced understanding of the trade-off between individual liberty and the public good, along with who should have the power to define the public good, also explains the overall public response to the government’s handling of the pandemic.
In the first stage, when we did not understand the nature of the Wuhan virus and ways to deal with it, the government view prevailed and the people followed the national lockdown. As our scientific and global experiential understanding improved, we began to challenge the unilateral demands of the government and forced a more differentiated view of the situation, geographically and socio-economically. And later, even the ardent supporters began to criticise the government. If only the government had understood this nuance and genuinely consulted the affected people.
The position that liberty always trumps public good or that public good must always override individual agency is just a longing for simplicity and purity at best. It is probably more for sloganeering and tribal belonging. In real-life situations, individual liberty and public good are far more compatible than what the political and medical elite believe.

Goa: Positivity rate drops to 3% but doctors call for caution,1485,"PANAJI: Goa reported 126 fresh infections, one mortality, and 134 recoveries, taking the active caseload to 1,779 over the last 24 hours. The case positivity rate dropped to 3% on Thursday as against 4% on Wednesday.
The toll rose to 3,103 with one death. A 90-year-old man from Ponda died at South Goa district hospital after two days of treatment. While Goa’s weekly case positivity rate has been below 5%, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said people need to be more careful as curfew conditions are relaxed.



The weekly case positivity is 3.64% as against 4.17% a week before.

While there has been a plus and minus in daily infections, Betodakar said they haven’t noticed any big rise in any area, and if there is, the government will be immediately notified. “Our fervent request to people who are yet to get vaccinated is please do at the earliest. People should continue to take measures as restrictions are slowly being lifted,” Betodakar said.
South Goa has more active cases with Margao, Ponda and Cortalim having high caseloads.
The estimated third wave is likely to hit in August-September. Experts say the state will have a buffer if a large section of the population is vaccinated, provided no new variant deadlier than Delta makes its way.
The state government has set a target to vaccinate the 11.5 lakh adult population with the first dose by the end of this month. As of Wednesday, 7.48 lakh people were partially vaccinated and 1.89 lakh with both doses.

"Mumbai: Health, police staff on Covid duty perform under immense pressure due to poor manpower",2885,"MUMBAI: Whereas thousands of policemen and health officers on the covid forefront are burning the midnight oil and putting their lives at risk to fight the pandemic, shockingly their staff strength seems to be the lowest in the state.
An RTI query by activist Anil Galgali has revealed that the state government has the highest job vacancies in home and public health departments besides in zilla parishads or municipal councils. Interestingly, both the departments are presently facing a mammoth challenge with lesser strength thus putting pressure on the present staff working on the ground.

As per the state government reply to Galgali's RTI application, there are more than two lakh vacancies in the Government of Maharashtra as well as in the Zilla Parishads, local self bodies in rural areas.
Interesting to note that in mofussil areas of the districts too, parishad or council administration is working 24x7 to tackle covid cases.

At the government level, the vacancy is spread over 29 administrative departments of which 16 do not have up to date information about the vacancies in them.
The total number of sanctioned posts in 29 government departments and zilla parishads (municipal councils) is 10,99,104. Out of which 8,98,911 posts have been filled whereas 2,00,193 posts are vacant till December 2019. This amounts to a nearly 20 per cent shortage of manpower.
There are 153231 vacancies of government employees and 40944 vacancies in zilla parishads. Out of the total 29 departments, information on 16 was available only till December 2018.
While the home department is short of around 24000 staff members, the public health force lacks over 20500 people, reveals the information provided by the state's general administration department. Similarly, water conservation has a shortage of 20800 officers followed by 14000 in agriculture and over 10000 in revenue and land records.
According to Anil Galgali, a large number of vacancies affect work and as a result, citizens have to suffer. In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Anil Galgali has demanded that the government should fill these vacancies as soon as possible.
The former chief secretary and ex-chief information commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad, who had a long stint as DG of Yashwant Rao Chavan academy of development administration, Pune, said 10 per cent vacancies are normal but if they touch 20 per cent and above then matter gets serious and can impact day-to-day work.
""To anticipate the requirement of staff, a systematic approach and training in capacity assessment and building are needed. If that happens, then requisition can be sent to state service commission at right time to get the staff appointed without any delay,"" he said maintaining the fact that political will was most crucial in making such decisions.

"Gujarat: Fundraising surges in healthcare, allied sectors",3365,"AHMEDABAD: With the Covid-19 pandemic turning the focus on healthcare, several companies in the sector are now raising funds to meet the growing need for innovative therapies, diagnostics, and healthcare services. Initial public offerings (IPOs) and private equity (PE) are the preferred means for raising funds in the healthcare and allied sectors.

Gujarat-based companies such as Aashka Hospitals Limited and Ami Organics Limited have set the ball rolling to launch their IPOs. Veeda Clinical Research, too, is mulling an IPO, said sources.
Aashka, which operates a 200-bed multispecialty hospital in Gandhinagar, is gearing up to raise Rs 101 crore through an SME (small and medium enterprise) IPO by the end of this month. Aashka Hospitals will be listed on the BSE’s SME Exchange.

Big cities have many tertiary care hospitals, but such hospitals are not adequate in tier-II and tier-III towns. “We aim to bridge this gap by reaching out to small towns with the best healthcare services,” said Bipin Shah, chairman and managing director, Aashka Hospitals.
“As part of our capital-light growth model, we are coming up with 20-50 bed hospitals in small towns of Gujarat by merging local hospitals with Aashka Hospitals,” Shah said. “This will enable patients to avail of the state-of-the-art healthcare services in or near their hometowns without the hassles of travelling to big cities for quality treatment.”
Shah has envisaged 1,000-bed capacity through mergers with 35 hospitals over the next two years.
According to Shah, doctors will also be relieved of day-to-day administration and focus only on treatment as the end-to-end management will be completely taken care of by Aashka Hospitals.
Ahmedabad-headquartered Veeda Clinical Research is also mulling an IPO, said people aware of the matter. The full-service clinical research organization (CRO) last month raised $16 million (approximately Rs 118 crore) from the private equity fund Sabre Partners and other investors.
Surat’s specialty chemicals maker Ami Organics Limited has filed its papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for an IPO. The company manufactures pharma intermediates for regulated and generic active pharmaceutical ingredients and new chemical entities.
Healthcare and allied sector companies in other states are also increasingly raising funds from the primary market. Companies from other states such as Glenmark Lifesciences Limited, Windlas Biotech Limited, Krsnaa Diagnostics, Supriya Lifesciences Ltd, and Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited have filed papers with SEBI for their IPOs.
Companies such as Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences have already raised funds through an IPO.
“Healthcare is a sunrise sector and poised to grow significantly over the next decade. Apart from the IPOs, a lot of private equity deals are being struck in the sector,” said Viranchi Shah, national senior vice-president, Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA).
This can be seen from the fact that Ahmedabad-headquartered pharma firm La Renon Healthcare in January this year reportedly raised around $30 million (about Rs 220 crore) from a venture capital firm A91 Partners. In April, ChrysCapital acquired 27% stake in the city-based Corona Remedies Private Limited for an undisclosed sum.

Thailand state drugmaker sues critic of its vaccine procurement,1866,"BANGKOK: Thailand's state drugmaker on Wednesday said it had initiated a defamation suit against the prominent chairman of a private hospital operator over his criticism of its procurement of Moderna Covid-19 vaccines.
The Government pharmaceutical organization (GPO) suit accuses Boon Vanasin of providing false information, claiming that the GPO, as coordinator for Moderna vaccines for private hospitals, sought to maximize profit from the public, the GPO said in a statement.

""This damaged the GPO and therefore it is necessary to take legal action,"" it said.
The lawsuit comes as the government comes under fire for its vaccine policy, which has so far relied on Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines.

Another critic of the strategy, opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, is facing charges of insulting the monarchy after accusing the government of over-reliance on a royal-owned firm to produce AstraZeneca vaccines. The crime is punishable by up to 15 years imprisonment.
Boon, the outspoken chairman of Thonburi Healthcare Group pcl and another critic of the government's vaccine policy, told local media that he welcomed the complaint.
""If GPO is suing me, then it's a good thing,"" Boon was quoted saying by local media.
""The GPO documents can be revealed and opened in court. It's all there, how many and how much.""
Boon could not be immediately reached for comment and Thonburi healthcare group did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Demand for mRNA vaccines in Thailand has surged amid slow rollout of the AstraZeneca shot and waning confidence in Sinovac.
The private hospital association had requested the GPO purchase 10 million Moderna doses for patients who had showed interest.
The GPO last month said it had procured just 3.9 million doses of the vaccine for private hospitals and expects another 1.1 million doses in 2022.

"Spread of Covid-19's Delta variant will substantially up cases, put pressure on healthcare: WHO",5549,"UNITED NATIONS/GENEVA: The increased transmissibility associated with the Covid-19's Delta variant is likely to substantially increase cases and put greater pressure on healthcare systems, particularly in the contexts of low vaccine coverage, WHO has warned.
In its Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update released on Tuesday, the World Health Organisation said that an overall rise in Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant is reported across all WHO regions.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

As of July 13, at least 111 countries, territories and areas have reported detection of the Delta variant, and this is expected to continue to increase, becoming the dominant variant globally in the coming months.
""The increased transmissibility associated with the Delta variant is likely to result in substantial increases in case incidence and greater pressure on healthcare systems, particularly in contexts of low vaccine coverage,"" it said.

Globally, cases of the Alpha variant have been reported in 178 countries, territories or areas, while 123 countries reported cases of the Beta variant, 75 countries reported cases of the Gamma variant.
The update said that the Delta variant has shown higher transmissibility than other Variants of Concerns (VOCs) identified to date.
""The increased transmissibility means that it is likely to become the dominant variant globally over the coming months,"" the update said.
It said that the emergence of more transmissible variants, coupled with the relaxation and inappropriate use of Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM) and increased social mobility and mixing and low vaccination coverage in many countries continue to contribute to rapid surges in incidence, hospitalizations and deaths in many countries.
""Moreover, in large parts of the world, there remain gaps in epidemiological surveillance, testing and genomic sequencing, and this limits our ability to monitor and assess the impact of current and future variants in a timely manner,"" it said.
The update noted that as countries gradually resume non-essential international travel, the introduction of risk mitigation measures aiming to ""reduce travel-associated exportation, importation and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be based on thorough risk assessments conducted systematically and routinely.""
Almost a quarter (24.7 per cent) of the world's population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine - over three billion doses administered. However, there are vast inequities in vaccine distribution and administration with the majority of vaccines administered in a small number of high and upper-middle-income countries.
The update of the Covax facility has been working to reduce this gap, but a large proportion of the world's population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
""The breadth and quality of evidence of the efficacy and effectiveness of current vaccines against emerging variants remain limited; nevertheless, the available evidence suggests full vaccination offers high levels of protection against severe disease and death for all four VOCs, with mixed evidence as to the impacts on infection, mild-moderate disease and transmission.
""Virus evolution and the phenotypic impacts of all variants, including potential immune escape, require close monitoring and assessment, including the possible need for future adjustments to vaccine composition, vaccination strategies, and/or coverage targets,"" it said.
The global number of new cases reported last week (July 5-11, 2021) was nearly 3 million, a 10 per cent increase as compared to the previous week. Following a steady decline for nine consecutive weeks, the number of weekly deaths increased by 3 per cent this week compared to the previous week, with over 55,000 deaths reported, the update said.
Globally, Covid-19 incidence increased with an average of over 4,00,000 cases reported each day as compared to 3,70,000 from the previous week.
The cumulative number of cases reported globally is now over 186 million and the number of deaths exceeds 4 million.
This week, all regions with the exception of the Americas recorded an increase in incidence. The Eastern Mediterranean Region recorded the largest increase in incidence (25 per cent) followed by European Region with a 20 per cent increase as compared to the previous week.
The African Region had the smallest percentage increase in incidence with a 5 percent increase. However, the region recorded a 50 percent increase in the number of deaths as compared to the previous week.
The South-East Asia Region also recorded a significant increase in the number of deaths, reporting a 26 percent increase as compared to the previous week. The Region of the Americas reported a 3 per cent decline in incidence and an 11 percent decrease in the number of deaths reported last week.
The update said that the highest number of new cases were reported from Brazil (333,030 new cases; 9 per cent decrease), India (291,789 new cases; 7 per cent decrease), Indonesia (243,119 new cases; 44 percent increase), the United Kingdom (210,277 new cases; 30 per cent increase) and Colombia (174,320 new cases; 15 per cent decrease).
In the South-East Asia Region, the highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (6,035 new deaths; 0.4 new deaths per 100,000; a 4 per cent decrease), Indonesia (5,882 new deaths; 2.2 new deaths per 100,000; a 71 per cent increase) and Bangladesh (1,354 new deaths; 0.8 new deaths per 100,000; a 52 per cent increase)."
"‘Vaccine acceptance not optimal among medics in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, says study",3442,"CHANDIGARH: A study involving medical and dental professionals in different hospitals in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh has shown that they have suboptimal levels of acceptance and attitude towards the anti-Covid vaccines.
Low acceptance for vaccines among the group has been attributed to their hesitancy due to safety issues, development of vaccines in an emergency and unforeseen effects.

Healthcare workers, especially those leading the frontline fight, are at greater risk of contracting the virus, and are being vaccinated on priority to keep them safe.
A total of 520 professionals --283 dental and 237 medical health – participated in the study conducted to assess the attitude and acceptance of healthcare professionals towards Covid-19 vaccines. Of these, 182 were deployed on Covid related duties at their respective workplace.

As many as 45.5% of dental staff and 48.4% of medical healthcare professionals showed concern regarding unforeseen effects of vaccines. More than 40% of the subjects preferred natural immunity over vaccines. About 37% of them were not willing to get vaccinated while 35% reported that they would not recommend vaccines to others.


Overall, 65% of participants showed a positive attitude towards vaccination and the findings were significantly associated with the working profile of participants. Willingness to get vaccinated was 3.45 higher in subjects who were involved in Covid duties. The fact that vaccination should be compulsory for all citizens of India was emphasised by 76.6% of medical and 78% of dental professionals.
The study concluded: “The rate of acceptance of Covid-19 vaccine among participants was suboptimal though 65% of subjects showed a positive attitude towards the vaccine.”
To reduce vaccine doubtfulness, it has been recommended that personalised policies be formulated to address the concerns highlighted in the study. The experts have laid stress on organising educational programmes among health care workers to eliminate their doubts concerning the vaccine.
Efforts should be made to convince healthcare workers that existing vaccines provide reasonable protection and are effective against many variants of interest and concern.
Governments have been suggested to engage eminent personalities to combat any misinformation regarding the vaccine through mass media communication channels. Social media monitoring should be done and any type of erroneous claims regarding Covid vaccines should be refuted.
The study published by the National Institute of Public Health, Poland, has been carried out by Avneet Kaur of Swami Devi Dyal Dental College and Hospital, Haryana; Gagandeep Kaur of Charolais Dentistry, Brampton, Canada; Akanksha Kashyap of Babu Banarasi Das College of Dental Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh; Gaganpreet Singh of Civil Hospital, Jalandhar, Punjab; Harnoor Singh Sandhu of Gian Sagar Medical College and Hospital, Punjab; Iqra Khilji of Hazrat Haleema Maternity and General Hospital, Malerkotla, Punjab; and Ramandeep Singh Gambhir of Rayat and Bahra Dental College and Hospital, Mohali, Punjab.
“While the expecting Covid-19 vaccine could be effective in protecting the healthcare workers, our data shows that uncertain attributes like safety, development of vaccines in an emergency, unforeseen effects are likely a hurdle for low acceptance,” said Dr Ramandeep Singh Gambhir.

Thailand has reported more than 353,700 coronavirus cases and 2,847 deaths -- the bulk of them detected since the latest wave kicked off in April from an upscale Bangkok nightlife district.
Healthcare workers were the first in line to receive Sinovac, but authorities said Sunday nearly 900 medical staff -- most of them vaccinated with that shot -- got Covid-19.
They will now also get an AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot, authorities said.
Virus hotspot Bangkok and nine other hard-hit provinces are now under tougher restrictions that include a night-time curfew and a ban of gatherings over five people.
The administration of Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha has come under vociferous criticism for its handling of the pandemic, from accusations of vaccine mismanagement to the lack of government compensation for affected sectors.
On Tuesday, his cabinet approved a 30 billion baht ($920 million) rehabilitation scheme to aid businesses -- including retail, entertainment and construction -- affected by the severe restrictions in Bangkok and nine other provinces.
Residential utility bills such as water and electricity will also be lowered for two months, the cabinet said.

"Odisha: Covid cases go below 2,000 for first time in 3 months",2323,"BHUBANESWAR: After oscillating between 2,500-3,000 for nearly two weeks, the new infection count in the state on Monday came down to fewer than 2,000 (1993), for the first time since April 13.
This also dragged down the positivity rate to 2.73% from 2.91% a day before as the fresh positive cases were from among the 72,754 samples tested in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, the government confirmed 63 more Covid deaths, taking the toll to 4,662. Khurda, which has been reporting the highest daily fatalities for quite some time, saw 13 more deaths. The day’s Covid toll is put out after the death audit being conducted by the state. Khurda has been witnessing the maximum deaths as it boasts of the highest number of Covid beds, with the capital city coming under it’s jurisdiction. The second wave has seen around 2,800 official deaths so far.
Healthcare experts said though the steady fall in the Covid infections and the TPR are signs of improvement in the situation, some districts continue to remain areas of concern. While Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada districts are seeing a sharp decline, Jajpur’s daily Covid cases remain above 100 even as Khurda’s new infections have dropped to below 400. The latter’s daily count had dropped earlier to fewer than 400 in June following Cyclone Yaas. The experts said while that was a superficial drop owing to fewer tests, the latest dip in cases and the district’s TPR to 3.54% are positive indicators. Cuttack, too, is seeing a let-up in cases.

Ajay Parida, director of the Institute of Life Sciences, said, “Though both the TPR and the daily count are decreasing, the rate of decrease is slow. Considering that the overall fall is sluggish and some coastal districts continue to remain vulnerable, we need to be careful. Apart from Mayurbhanj and Jajpur among the districts that saw a spurt recently, Puri has to be monitored as the cases there may rise after the Rath Yatra. The Covid graph in Balasore has been seeing ups and downs.”
Four districts — Gajapati, Deogarh, Kalahandi and Nuapada — reported cases in single digits on Monday. Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Puri, besides Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, reported cases in triple digits. At 42, Nuapada is left with the lowest active case count.

"Delhi: To save time, cut Covid risk, NDMC to go online with healthcare facilities",2684,"NEW DELHI: To simplify the process of patients’ registration, visits, testing and pharmacy facilities at its hospitals, dispensaries and polyclinics, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) plans to introduce the e-hospital concept by the month-end.
The civic body is currently uploading registration details on software provided by National Informatics Centre to help patients access medical facilities conveniently. In later stages, the system will also have information about the type of testing, medicines, etc available at the hospitals and dispensaries.

“The concept was planned thoroughly and implemented in sequence. To begin with, we will make the registration process online. Patients will need to register their appointment department-wise at the counter of hospitals, dispensaries and polyclinics. Later, this facility will be available on NDMC’s 311 app,” said a senior official.
The official added, “This will save time and commuting cost as visitors will be able to take appointments from their home after registering on the app through their mobile number. They can confirm the hospital, polyclinic, department, date and timings they want to visit. There will be a limit on bookings for a department on a particular day. However, unlike private hospitals, we will not give the option of selecting doctors.”

After completing the registration exercise, the next step for NDMC would be uploading patients’ details/prescription on the software. This would be followed by uploading details of laboratories and pharmacies. “When all background details of patients are online, we will persuade doctors to issue e-prescriptions. This will do away with the need to carry a hard copy of the doctor’s prescription on each visit. Also, doctors will be easily able to refer to the case history and prescriptions given by their colleagues,” said the official.
Two hospitals — Charak Palika and Palika Maternity Hospital — are currently providing a number of testing facilities at very nominal rates. “We will upload the details of these tests, rates and availability on a particular day on the website and app. When the patients avail of the facility based on the doctor’s prescription, the test results will automatically be attached to their account. Patients can check the test results after logging into their password-protected account,” the official said.
“Similarly, when certain medicines are prescribed by doctors, the details will go to the pharmacy and, accordingly, patients can check their availability. In fact, by the time a patient reaches the pharmacy counter, he will be already in queue and need not wait for long to get the medicines,” the official further stated.

Long use of earphones in WFH causing ENT issues: Doctors,2061,"CHENNAI: In the past month since school began, Dr Praveen Basker has seen around 10 children with complaints that they hear a ringing sound or feel their ears are blocked.
The ENT specialist at Rela Hospital says there is a marked increase in the adults coming in as well with ear infections and issues such as ringing, clicking or buzzing in the ears, difficulty hearing, and earaches.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.



“Most of these external ear infections can be traced to prolonged use of earphones. Most students are plugged in for class and then for hours after. The ear needs a break,” says Dr Basker. “The ear canal should not be obstructed for prolonged amounts of time as this can result in the buildup of wax. Also, earbuds are prime surfaces for dirt. If that accumulates it can lead to infection if not cleaned regularly,” he adds.

The ear has sweat and sebaceous glands, so if you use the earphones for long hours without removing them the sweat can cause bacteria to colonise there, leading to an infection, explains ENT consultant at MGM Healthcare Dr Sanjeev Mohanty. “We are also seeing more cases of tinnitus, which manifests as an annoying ringing sensation, almost like you have crickets in your ear. It too is exacerbated by the long hours of earphone use,” he says. “When we test the hearing, it appears alright but then we find that hearing of high frequencies sounds are affected. Those affected with tinnitus can’t hear higher pitch sounds as well as they hear lower pitch sounds,” says Dr Mohanty.
Dr Basker suggests the “60 by 60 rule” — keeping the earphone volume at less than 60% and taking a break every 60 minutes. “It can help prevent the infections to some extent,” he explains. “Keep the sound at 60 decibels, which is normal conversation level. Anything above 85 decibels (the noise level of city traffic) is harmful,” he says. “Headphones are a safer option when compared to earphones as they leave some form of buffer space between the audio and the ear canal,” says Dr Basker.

'Fight for vaccine': Thais snap up shots in seconds via Shopee sale,1956,"BANGKOK: A hospital in Thailand taking reservations this week for the Moderna Coronavirus vaccine was sold out in minutes-after offering shots via e-commerce platform Shopee.
With a worsening outbreak and worries about the efficacy of vaccines offered locally, appetite has quickly grown in Thailand for mRNA vaccines, which aren't available until near the end of the year.

""It was sold out within minutes,"" a Shopee spokesperson said on Friday, adding the vaccine sale saw a spike in traffic on Phyathai Hospital's page, attracting 2.6 million visitors.
It offered 1,800 slots for doses of the Moderna vaccine at 1,650 Baht ($50) a piece via Shopee, a unit of Singapore-based Sea Ltd.,

""They were sold out at record speed,"" the hospital's CEO, Att Thongtang, told Reuters. ""I feel very sorry for those who missed it.""
One buyer called Lovesujuforever wrote: ""It's gone in 15 seconds and I'm so lucky to get one.""
Another, labellelabel, said: ""It's a fight for vaccine.""
Hospital operator Thonburi Healthcare Group Pcl sold all 800,000 Moderna doses it ordered in two days, its chairman, Boon Vanasin, told Reuters.
Demand for the Moderna vaccine has increased after a leaked health ministry memo showed the Thai government was considering giving a booster shot of mRNA vaccine to medical workers who had already received two doses of Sinovac's vaccine.
Thailand and neighbours like Indonesia have reported breakthrough infections among medical and frontline workers inoculated with Sinovac's inactivated virus vaccine.
Thailand is also using the viral vector vaccine of AstraZeneca, but health experts have urged the government to include more mRNA vaccines in its programme, like that of Pfizer and BioNTech .
Private hospitals in Thailand, via a state procurement, will receive five million doses of the Moderna vaccine between this year and 2022. Thailand has also ordered 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for delivery after October.

Andhra Pradesh woman sues firm for denying insurance claim,2209,"BENGALURU: A senior citizen recently sued a medical insurance company for rejecting her claim towards knee treatment at a Bengaluru clinic. After a two-year legal battle, a consumer court ordered the firm to grant her the full amount of nearly Rs 1.3 lakh and a compensation of Rs 20,000.
A native of Andhra Pradesh, Gayatri Venkateswaralu, 60, was suffering from severe osteoarthritis. With walking and regular work becoming difficult, she contacted SBF Healthcare and Research Centre where veteran radiologist Dr V G Vasishta offers treatment with his researched methods.

Row over procedure
In July 2018, Gayatri underwent sequentially programmed magnetic field (SPMF) therapy and experienced great relief on her legs. Holding an active Medi-classic Insurance Policy of Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Limited for which she paid dues since 2009, Gayatri submitted her claim for a bill of Rs 1.3 lakh. But it was denied on August 1, 2018.

The elderly woman and her husband tried to reason with insurance officials about the treatment of Kannada Rajyotsava award-winning doctor VG Vasishta who is famous for his SPMF. However, insurance officials stood their ground stating the therapy doesn’t attract rightful mediclaim. With all hope lost, Gayatri approached Bangalore IVth Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Shantinagar on February 21, 2019.
During the litigation that lasted for close to 28 months, Gayatri’s lawyer presented her case while the company’s attorney claimed they rightfully denied the claim. He stated the clauses were explained to the policy holder in advance and expenses incurred on the enhanced external counter-pulsation therapy, rotational field quantum magnetic resonance therapy and similar procedures were not included.
However, the judges cited a similar case of SPMF treatment where a medical insurance claim was granted to the customer and said denying the amount to the elderly woman was unjustified. On June 14, 2021, the court asked the firm to give Gayatri Rs 1.25 lakh with interest, apart from Rs 10,000 as compensation and Rs 10,000 towards her court expenses.

"After 3-year wait, Russian boy gets new pair of lungs in Chennai",2279,"CHENNAI: Nazar Dianov was brought to Chennai on a ventilator as an infant, but the four-year-old will soon fly back to his home in Russia with a pair of new lungs. Nearly seven months after doctors performed a bi-lateral lung transplant, Dianov is slowly getting back to healthy near-normal life, say doctors.
On Wednesday, Dianov, who is still at the MGM Heathcare’s sterile unit, was seen playing with his mom, who is also a nurse. His grandmother, Olga Dianova, told reporters that the family decided to bring the child to India as they had no other option. “He needed new lungs to live but no hospital we approached was willing to do the transplant,” she said. With the child on a ventilator, the family waited for nearly three years before he got a new pair of lungs. “We thank India for this generous gift,” she said.

The boy was diagnosed with fibrosing alveolitis — a disease of unknown cause mainly involving the gas-exchanging portions of the lungs – when he was two months old. He was instantly put on a ventilator. Four months later, doctors did a tracheostomy — an opening created at the front of the neck so a tube can be inserted into the windpipe (trachea) so the child breathes. He was then brought to MGM Healthcare for lung transplant.
Doctors at the hospital said this is one of the longest duration for a child to be kept on a ventilator before undergoing a successful transplant. “A foreigner gets the organ only when there is no other Indian in need. It is even more difficult if the patient is a child, because children will need organs from donors of their age. We don’t yet have a pediatric cadaver registry. During the pandemic, there were hardly any organs,” said senior transplant surgeon Dr K R Balakrishnan, who heads the heart and lung transplant programme at the hospital.

In December 2020, the hospital received a call about the organ of a two-year child declared brain dead by doctors in Surat. A team of doctors from the hospital harvested the organ and used it for Dianov on December 15, 2020. “Nazar was under observation in ICU care for nearly seven months. We are happy now to report that the newly transplanted lungs are responding well,” said Dr K G Suresh Rao, co-director of heart and lung transplantation programme at the hospital.

FIR in fake favipiravir racket,1259,"AHMEDABAD: A complaint of attempt to culpable homicide was filed against Sudip Mukherjee, owner of Max Relief Healthcare, for his alleged involvement in a multi-state fake favipiravir racket.
The firm showed its registered address at Solan in Himachal Pradesh, but no firm by that name was found. Mukherjee through his accomplices provided fake medicines to a firm named Aarmed Formulation in Prahladnagar.

An FDCA team found a stock of 133 strips of Favimax 200 and Favimax 400 tablets in the Aarmed office but an analysis revealed there was no favipiravir in those tablets.
The FIR mentions that Mukherjee supplied the fake medicine despite knowing that it may prove fatal to Covid patients. He was booked for attempt to culpable homicide along with other charges.

An inquiry by Food and Drugs Administration revealed that Mukherjee was selling drugs to wholesalers in the state without licence to do so. All states were alerted to stop using this drug.
On May 30, Mukherjee, appeared before FDA but carried no documents linked to production and sale of drugs. At first glance, the photocopy of a licence that he produced appeared fake. He was handed over to Samta Nagar police station in Mumbai where an FIR was registered and he was arrested on June 7.

ER augments healthcare infra at railway hospitals,1840,"BHAGALPUR: The Eastern Railway (ER) is augmenting its health infrastructure at railway hospitals under its jurisdiction in order to provide better healthcare to its employees and railway passengers in case the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic strikes the country. Altogether 15 railway employees at Jamalpur workshop have died in the second wave of Covid-19.
While doctors and paramedical staff are being appointed at the railway hospital on Bhagalpur railway station premises, machines and gadgets for microbiological tests and health check-ups are being installed at other railway hospitals.

The ER has installed ‘mini vidas machine’, a compact automated immunoassay system based on the enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) principles, at the divisional railway hospital at Asansol. The machine will also be installed at other hospitals soon.
Ekalabya Chakraborty, ER chief public relations officer, said the healthcare facilities are being augmented at railway hospitals as part of the preparations for any third wave of the Covid-19. “ELFA based mini vidas machines can help manage Covid and non-Covid cases better through its methodology of pathological prognostic testing with ease,” he said.

He added: “Apart from the Covid-19 pandemic prognostic marker like D-dimer, Procalcitonin, ferritin, the mini vidas machine will be used for thyroid testing, vitamin-D, PSA estimation for the railway employees and its beneficiaries. All such pathological tests were earlier done with in tie-up facilities, but now can be done at the railway hospitals.”
He claimed that in case of emergency, the mini vidas machine will be of extreme importance as it is convenient and user-friendly and provides accurate on-demand test results in less time. “We are also reviewing healthcare arrangements at all the railway hospitals under ER,” he added.

NYC honors essential workers at parade up Canyon of Heroes,3388,"NEW YORK: Essential workers who helped New York City through the covid-19 pandemic were honored Wednesday with a parade up Broadway, nurses, doctors, first responders, teachers, bus drivers and more riding on floats through a canyon of tall buildings and falling confetti.
The parade stretched from Battery Park to City Hall, led up Broadway in lower Manhattan by grand marshal Sandra Lindsay, a health care worker who was the first person in the country to get a covid-19 vaccine shot.

“What a difference a year makes,” said Lindsay. “Fifteen months ago, we were in a much different place but thanks to the heroic efforts of so many health care workers, first responders, frontline workers, the people who fed us, the people who put their lives on the line, we can't thank them enough,” she said.
Wednesday's essential workers parade was the latest in a 125-year New York City tradition. The same type of celebration, known as a ticker-tape parade for the thin bands of paper that used to shower marchers, has been held in the past to celebrate returning soldiers, astronauts and championship sports teams.

The last parade along the iconic stretch known as the Canyon of Heroes honored the US women's soccer team for their 2019 World Cup win.
“We've got a lot to appreciate, because we're well underway in our recovery. We've got a lot to celebrate and we've got a lot of people to celebrate,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio, who rode during the parade on a float with hospital employees and Mr. Met, the mascot of the New York Mets.
“They deserve a march down the Canyon of Heroes, because it's something that is reserved for the greatest folks in history. Well, here are some of the folks who made history in New York City's toughest hour,” he said.
Justin Davis, a nurse who came from Pittsburgh to work at a Manhattan hospital during the height of the crisis last year, was excited to be riding in the parade on a float sponsored by AMN Healthcare, the staffing company he works for.
“I think it's just going to be real cool,” Davis said. “And hopefully it can just bring closure.”
Davis, a 43-year-old military veteran, said he came to New York City when it was a pandemic epicenter, leaving his wife and three young children behind, “because I wanted to do something to make my family proud.”
The parade gave Davis' family and a whole bunch of New Yorkers a chance to express their pride and gratitude to him and other essential workers.
“This is a huge thing,” said his wife, Jennifer Davis. “This is awesome. We just had to come up here and be here for him, to support him and celebrate him.”
This week's high temperatures have cut into the celebration somewhat. Originally, a ceremony at City Hall was scheduled to follow the parade.
Instead, de Blasio and his wife will applaud the participants at the end of the route. Water will be available through the route and cooling stations for participants will be located at the beginning and end.
Labor strife has also cut into the plans.
Some EMS workers were planning to boycott the parade to protest what their union says is low pay.

Indian IT industry to post strong recovery with 11% revenue growth in FY22: Crisil,3408,"MUMBAI: The Indian IT industry will stage a “strong recovery” in 2021-22 with revenue growth of up to 11 per cent, rating agency Crisil said on Wednesday.
The recovery will be led by increasing outsourcing and accelerating digital transformation services mainly in sectors such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, it said.

As per Nasscom, the IT services industry grew 2.7 per cent to $99 billion in 2020-21. The wider industry including e-commerce, business process management, and global back-offices had grown 2.3 per cent to $194 billion in the last fiscal year, as per the industry lobby.
Industry stalwart Azim Premji, the founder chairman of Wipro, also expected a double-digit growth on Tuesday.

Crisil said higher business levels and more profitable digital deals (45 per cent share in revenues in FY21 versus 40 per cent in FY20) will also help IT services players maintain healthy operating margins.
“With customers focussing on optimising costs, outsourcing of IT services is seeing a steady rise globally. The pandemic has opened up additional opportunities in digital services due to surge in remote working, e-commerce, and automated services,” Crisil's senior director Anuj Sethi said.
He added that deal wins by Indian players have expanded by 20 per cent year-on-year in 2020-21, with 80 per cent of them being digital deals across verticals.
The revenue growth in 2021-22 will be almost 4 percentage points more than the growth of 6 per cent in last fiscal year and similar to the 10 per cent growth logged over fiscals 2018-2020, the agency said.
BFSI, which accounts for 28 per cent of IT service revenue, will clock 13-14 per cent growth in this fiscal year, up from FY21's 9 per cent rise due to rising share of digital transactions, continued regulatory compliance, and data security, it said.
Retail and manufacturing, which together account for 30 per cent of revenues, are expected to recover 8-9 per cent after slowing down to 2-3 per cent last fiscal year, it said.
Healthcare, though a small segment accounting for only 6 per cent of revenues, will sustain its high growth at 15-16 per cent, benefitting from higher spending on tackling COVID-19 and increasing adoption of virtual services.
Despite stronger revenue growth, profitability is unlikely to rise beyond the levels witnessed in 2020-21, it said, adding that operating margins expanded 2 percentage points to a seven-year high of 25 per cent in the last fiscal year mainly due to cost savings from lower travel, favourable onshore-offshore mix (due to lower onsite roles following the pandemic), and lower attrition levels.
“This fiscal, with gradual normalisation of businesses across the globe, a partial reversal of the cost savings logged last fiscal is likely,” Rajeswari Karthigeyan, associate director, said.
With the expansionary recruitment phase, including maintenance of higher bench strength, employee costs, which account for 67 per cent of revenues, are expected to rise.
The agency expects continued improvement in the credit quality of most IT firms, given their lowly leveraged balance sheets and robust liquidity.
Recurrence of additional waves of the pandemic in the US and Europe, which are key destinations for IT services, would be the factors to monitor, it said.

It’s official: Clinical pharmacists to augment healthcare,2831,"NAGPUR: Soon, doctors in big corporate hospitals will only prescribe the drugs (technical names of the medicines) and not the brand names to you, which has been a common practice all these years. A specialized health official — ‘clinical pharmacist’ — will be there to select appropriate drugs and dispense the medicines suitable to you, to monitor the progress of your health and to verify the side effects of the drugs.
The post of clinical pharmacist was not in the gazette in India, despite having the six-year Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm D) course running for more than 11 years. On July 5, it was finally included as the notification regarding Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015 was out.

Doctor of Pharmacy Association (DOPA), Maharashtra president Dr Vinayak Ghayal said, “As the Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) did not create any post called clinical pharmacist in the Pharmacy Practice Regulations (2015), this post has not been included in the policy of the government till now. We were pressing this demand for the last many years. Eventually, the government has issued gazette notification on July 5 and made this post official.”
Pharm D course was introduced on the lines of USA in 2010, where the degree holders are appointed in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, community health centres, pharmacies, drug stores etc. Unlike other pharma graduates or post graduates, Pharm D holders undergo at least one year of clinical rotations in hospitals and develop clinical acumen.

These professionals study human anatomy, biology, medicinal chemistry, molecular pharmacology, toxicology, psychology, health assessment, patient care and diagnosis procedure, along with pharmacy. They also use the ‘Dr’ prefix.
Kailas Tandale, president of Maharashtra Registered Pharmacists Association (MRPA), said, “We welcome this decision of the government which has the potential to bring about much-needed reform in Indian hospital settings.”
DOPA, Maharashtra vice-president Dr Akshay Shelke said, “Now, we want the authorities to utilize our knowledge and skills in the current pandemic scenario. In coming years, we will work at the ground level and create awareness amongst common people.”
ALL ABOUT THE POST
In USA, clinical pharmacists play a key role in providing medication and monitoring patient health

New York City honors essential workers at parade up Canyon of Heroes,2784,"NEW YORK: A pandemic would seem like the worst time to start working as a nurse in a Manhattan hospital, but there Justin Davis was last spring, trying desperately to help patients stricken with the coronavirus while worried for his own health.
The 43-year-old Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, resident was among those who stepped up to come to New York City when it was a pandemic epicenter, a choice that required leaving behind his wife and three young children for a situation filled with uncertainty and risk.

""I came because I wanted to do something to make my family proud,"" the military veteran said.
His family will get a chance to express their pride on Wednesday, along with a whole bunch of New Yorkers, at a parade honoring essential workers for their efforts in getting New York City through the pandemic.

""This is a huge thing,"" said his wife, Jennifer Davis. ""This is awesome. We just had to come up here and be here for him, to support him and celebrate him.""
Davis will be in the parade on a float sponsored by AMN Healthcare, the staffing company he works for that sent him to New York City and then other places around the country in the last year to work in Covid-swamped hospitals.
""I think it's just going to be real cool,"" Davis said. ""And hopefully it can just bring closure.""
The parade is slated to kick off at Battery Park and travel up Broadway in lower Manhattan, the iconic stretch known as the Canyon of Heroes, which has hosted parades honoring world leaders, celebrities and winning sports teams. The last parade before the pandemic honored the US women's soccer team after their 2019 World Cup win.
City officials said the parade's grand marshal would be Sandra Lindsay, a health care worker who was the first person in the country to get a Covid vaccine shot.
Other workers being honored include transportation workers, first responders, education and child care providers, and utility workers.
""We've got a lot to appreciate, because we're well underway in our recovery. We've got a lot to celebrate and we've got a lot of people to celebrate,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
""They deserve a march down the Canyon of Heroes, because it's something that is reserved for the greatest folks in history. Well, here are some of the folks who made history in New York City's toughest hour,"" he said.
The high temperatures of the week have cut into the celebration plans somewhat. Originally, the parade had been scheduled to be followed by a ceremony at City Hall.
Instead, the mayor and his wife will applaud the participants at the end of the parade route. Water will be available through the route and cooling stations for participants will be located at the beginning and end.

Set up genome sequencing lab within 15 days: Cong,2027,"Panaji: The new Covid-19 variant, Delta Plus, has already reached the neighbouring Konkan region, Karnataka and Kerala, and the Goa government needs to take proactive and immediate steps to control the entry and spread of the new variant in Goa, said Congress state president Girish Chodankar.
Congress said that by permitting people to enter the state with just a rapid antigen test, the government is endangering lives of Goans. “This variant can only be detected with speedy genome sequencing test. The irresponsible BJP government under chief minister Pramod Sawant must immediately take steps to start genome testing in Goa,” Chodankar said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that a very dangerous period lies ahead because of the spread of the contagious Delta variants. Healthcare experts warn that the third wave could hit Goa by August or September.
“The spread of this variant can be controlled with early detection and containment and hence Goa should have its own laboratory for genome sequencing testing,” Chodankar said. “It is high time that a full-fledged laboratory is setup to test all variants of Covid-19.”

At present, samples from Goa are sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the results are often obtained after over a month, if not longer. Congress claimed that the absence of a genome sequencing laboratory in Goa resulted in the failure of timely detection of new Covid-19 variants and a high number of Covid fatalities.
The party has demanded that the health department immediately setup a virology lab with genome sequencing facilities within 15 days or the party would launch an agitation.
In March 2020, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced that Goa would set up its own virology lab at Goa Medical College (GMC), but till date nothing has been setup.
“Chief minister Pramod Sawant must explain why the full-fledged testing laboratory has not been established till date,” Chodankar said.

Pune: Pregnant women in district to get separate vax centres,2207,"PUNE: Expectant mothers in the district will likely be offered separate Covid-19 vaccination centres when drives for them start in the next two to three days, officials said on Saturday.

Pregnant women with Covid-19 infection are at increased risk of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes, including higher chances of neonatal morbidity. Public health experts have said that they should be offered exclusive Covid vaccination centres, to keep them away from crowds.

Pune district has nearly 800 vaccination centres. Authorities said they plan to set aside at least five civic-run sites within PMC limits and three in PCMC for pregnant women. Rural Pune may get nearly 10 centres.
“It is likely that antenatal centres will be selected to vaccinate this group. Most women come to these centres for prenatal check-ups. So the hubs are ideal for their Covid vaccination,” Deshmukh said.
Out of the 800 vaccine sites of the district, nearly 350 are in PMC areas. The PCMC has 200 and the rest are in Pune rural.
“We plan to have a higher number of centres for pregnant women in Pune rural because of the region’s more diverse population. Women visiting these centres will be told about the benefits of vaccination along with informaion on common side-effects they can expect,” Deshmukh added. Healthcare workers at the antenatal centres will also be trained to counsel pregnant women.
Officials added that protocols of registration and generation of certificates will remain the same for this group as the general population.
Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “Ever since the Union government said it's okay to give pregnant women the Covid vaccines, there has been a spurt in enquiries at city gynaecologists’ from pregnant women. Many want to know more about vaccine safety and when is it okay to get the Covid jabs.”

"Covid-19: Targeted vaccination drive a better strategy, ICMR study says",2507,"NEW DELHI: “Smart vaccination” approaches that target the vulnerable population — in the context of the Indian Covid-19 epidemic — make for a smarter public health choice than mass vaccination, a mathematical modelling-based analysis by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) says.
The analysis shows an infection-preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all priority groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence of Covid-19 by 20.6% and total deaths by 29.7%. A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms, but not infection, will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% and cumulative mortality by 32.9%.

Covaxin's overall efficacy 77.8%, 65.2% effective against Delta variant: Bharat Biotech

HYDERABAD: India’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin is overall 77.8% effective against Covid-19 and 65.2% effective against the deadly Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Saturday. Revealing the final analysis results of its Phase III efficacy trial


The study supports a focus on vulnerable or priority group vaccination that seeks to reduce the incidence of mortality and offer greater protection against the disease. In a situation when vaccine supply is insufficient to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after key workers, priority should be accorded to all who are above 60 and subsequently individuals with co-morbidities. The analysis underlines that challenges that are particularly pressing in a country as large as India would persist even after more vaccine candidates are available.

“Vaccination rollout should prioritise those most at risk of severe outcomes of infection,” it says.

“‘Smart vaccination’ based on public health considerations, rather than mass vaccination, appears prudent,” the study concluded. The study also suggests vaccinating all defined priority groups against Covid-19 would have a substantial reduction in overall health burden, compared with a scenario of no vaccination, and complete lifting of restrictions.

TIMES VIEW

Rapid immunisation will not only protect people from falling severely ill as and when the third wave will arrive but there is also a possibility that the state capital may avert the third wave if 70-80% of the population is given at least one dose by September-October. However, even after vaccination, people need to take precautions because though vaccines may prevent severity, getting infected can lead to mutation in the virus. Experts say that the virus may mutate in a bid to avert antibodies generated by the vaccine.


It took 169 days to reach the milestone of 3 lakh since the start of the mass immunisation campaign on January 16. Among fully immunised, highest 29.1% ( 87,842) were in 45-59 years category followed by 26.4% (79,657) in 60 years and above group, 17.6% (53,304) healthcare workers, 15.7% (47,383) frontline workers and 10.9% (47,383) in the 18-44 age group.
“Daily vaccination count will increase further in the coming week as we are planning to expand the drive by increasing the number of booths in urban areas and starting ‘cluster inoculations’ in rural blocks of the district.

Zydus seeks nod for world’s first plasmid DNA Covid vaccine,2313,"AHMEDABAD: Homegrown healthcare and pharmaceutical major Zydus Cadila has applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) to the office of the Drug Controller General of India for ZyCoV-D, its plasmid DNA vaccine against Covid-19.
""As the first-ever plasmid DNA vaccine for human use, ZyCoV-D has proven its safety and efficacy profile in our fight against Covid-19. The vaccine, when approved, will help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12-to-18-years age group,"" said Dr Sharvil Patel, MD, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, the flagship of the Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila Group.
ZyCoV-D is a plasmid DNA vaccine which, when injected, produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from the disease as well as viral clearance.
ZyCoV-D has also been tested on adolescents between 12 and 18 years in India. Around 1,000 subjects in this age group were enrolled and the vaccine was found to be safe and very well tolerated. The tolerability profile was similar to that seen in the adult population.
Zydus is currently setting up a new facility to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine. ""Once the facility is commissioned by the end of this month, we can produce around one crore doses of the vaccine,"" added Patel, who refrained from giving a specific time line for the launch of the vaccine but stated that it can be done aggressively within 45-60 days once it gets regulatory approval.
Zydus Cadila has so far invested up to Rs 500 crore in the development of this vaccine, including the cost of establishing a new manufacturing facility.
According to Zydus, the plug-and-play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based is ideally suited for dealing with Covid-19 as it can be easily adapted to deal with virus mutations.
The company has also evaluated a two-dose regimen for ZyCoV-D using a 3mg dose per visit. The immunogenicity results had been found to be equivalent to the current three-dose regimen.
""This will further help in reducing the full course duration of vaccination while maintaining the high safety profile of the vaccine in the future,"" Patel added.

""In order to accelerate the vaccination drive, we are introducing the vaccine at Fortis Escorts Hospital, Jaipur, from Friday. We have received a good response and a total of 2,193 people have been vaccinated till now,"" he said.

The official said Fortis Healthcare has received fresh supplies of Sputnik V which will help it ramp up the inoculation drive.
A hospital source said there has been some delay in vaccine supply and it could be linked to the increase in cases in Russia, which has started a large-scale vaccination drive for its population.
An official of Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital in Delhi said the facility will receive Sputnik V doses from Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country, in three to four days.
Sputnik V uses two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. The two doses, given 21 days apart, are different and not interchangeable.
The Centre has fixed the price of the vaccine at Rs 1,145 per dose. The maximum price of Covishield for private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) has been fixed at RS 780 per dose, while that of Covaxin is Rs 1,410 per dose.
Russia's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology has developed the vaccine and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is marketing it globally.
Dr Reddy's Laboratories has been importing the shots from Russia. Over a period of time, the vaccine is also going to be manufactured in India.

Dr Kumar said when he was growing up, the choice was between engineering and MBBS, but it’s not the same now, and bright students are weighing their choices. Dr Kumar, 55, said, as it is, critical care services are no longer the preferred choice for many MBBS graduates because of the sheer hard work it involves.
“There have been days when I didn’t move from a patient’s side even for a minute and continued to work without a break into the next day,” Dr Kumar said. “There are no set working hours for those providing critical care. We cannot even have our meals on time.”

The doctor suffered a nasty scalp injury after he was hit by a patient’s son with a mobile phone inside his hospital’s ICU on June 12.
The son was irate as his father, who had tested negative, was shifted to a non-Covid ICU but showed no improvement.
“The attacker maybe my son’s age. I have no hard feelings. It is inappropriate behaviour. It’s not a problem for the individual alone, but society at large,” Dr Kumar said. The doctor was back at work the next day, boosting the morale of his colleagues. A complaint was registered.
Dr Kumar was the first in his hospital to treat a suspected Covid patient in ICU way back in March 2020.
“Covid has become nightmarish. Our efficiency drops by 50% because we must wear PPE. Eyes blur and we can’t drink a drop of water. Acute dehydration sets in. We can’t use the restroom while wearing PPE as the virus could breach the safety gear,” he said, adding the satisfaction he derives when a patient recovers makes it worth all the trouble.

Delhi Medical Association’s plea in Supreme Court to protect doctors against rising violence,1383,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Medical Association on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre to put in place preventive measures to protect the doctor and healthcare workers, who are working tirelessly in treating Covid patients, from the violence unleashed by irate relatives of patients.
DMA, with over 15,000 members from medical fraternity, cited 23 instances of recent attacks on doctors and healthcare workers in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Kerala, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to argue that the existing laws punishing assaulters of doctors and healthcare workers have not proved an effective deterrent.
Quoting a study by famous and one of the oldest medical journals, ‘The Lancet’, the petitioner through advocate Sneha Kalita said “nearly 75% doctors in India have faced either verbal or physical violence during their lifetime.” DMA said the state laws, which punish those assaulting doctors, do not provide a preventive security mechanism for doctors or creation of a safety room in the hospital where the targeted doctor or health worker could retreat in the face of an impending assault. “There is no central policy for compensation by the government to the injured doctor/healthcare personnel or their kith and kin, if they succumb to injuries caused by the assault from relatives of the patients,” the DMA said.

"Covid needs a regional response, say participants at 'Neighbours in peace & health' meet",4133,"BATHINDA: Physicians and health rights activists from across South Asia came together virtually to emphasize that the coronavirus pandemic must be fought collectively. The meeting organised by the South Asia Peace Action Network (SAPAN), the third in the South Asia Peace series focused on health as an entry point to talk about South Asian regionalism and healthcare for all.
SAPAN is a coalition of individuals and organisations aiming to take forward a peace agenda for the region, building on the work done by mentors and leaders over the last few decades.

It was deliberated on how the pandemic is affecting rural areas of South Asian countries, hurdles in treatment, and access, or lack thereof, to vaccinations, how it has affected mental health, women and particularly women in rural areas of all the countries of the region and how the challenges are similar in all countries of the region and require similar solutions.
“South Asian countries cannot go it alone, that is irrational,’’ said Dr. Zafrullah Chowdhury, noted public health activist and Ramon Magsaysay awardee from Bangladesh.

""The hard lockdown in his country will lead to furthering the inequalities in society, he warned, emphasizing that it is irresponsible to impose lockdowns without providing food as poverty has increased and there are 25 million more poor without food"", he said.
The meeting took place at a time when Delta plus virus mutation detected in parts of the region with looming large of the possibility of another wave.Chowdhury advocated challenging vaccine-producing countries and pushing South Asian governments to invest more in public health.
Participants also noted that the pandemic has particularly hit women hard as domestic violence has increased.
Public health activist Vandana Prasad from Delhi said women often lack control over finances, they are primary caregivers and shoulder the responsibility of caring for the ill. The pandemic has pushed women further into the margins, she said, adding that there is also a gender dimension to the access of vaccines. She urged doctors to enter the peace activism domain, because the poor all over are at brink of disaster.
Prasad drew attention to the gendered nature of pandemic and frontline workers, as well as Dalits, indigenous people, other minorities. Telemedicine is important, but we must not lose focus on need for ground-based public health to begin with. Frontline workers in India, the accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers often lack training, safety equipment and often doesn’t get her wages for months, she stated.
While highlighting that a public health system is meant to be a great equaliser, Dr Anup Subedee noted how the pandemic exposed systematic failures in many aspects of life in Nepal, referring not only to the grievous impact on non-Covid healthcare - like child immunization and maternity care - but also the painful ordeals of healthcare community itself.
He shared how the healthcare community in Nepal has been compelled to deal with threats of violence, lack of access to personal protection equipment, prospects of income loss without any social security system support, and an unaddressed mental health crisis among healthcare workers.
Doctors at the meeting endorsed the need for greater cooperation and collaboration across borders. Participants called on the governments to allow free flow of critical equipment and medical personnel across borders. It was said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had floated the idea of a SAARC medical visas for patients and for medical teams to assist during the pandemic – something that must be followed up.
The doctors also urged the international fraternity to push for a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, waiver so that the Covid-19 vaccine production can be ramped up. “It is the way forward for vaccines for all,’’ asserted Prasad.
SAPAN founder and curator Beena Sarwar shared the vision for an inter-generational, multi-sectoral, inter- and intra-regional coalition of individuals and organisations coming together in broad consensus for a one-point agenda.

Singapore to roll out new healthcare system for foreign workers,2346,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is set to roll out a new medical system for migrant or foreign workers to provide primary healthcare and reduce the risks of future disease outbreaks through active surveillance, a media report said on Wednesday.
The system, to be rolled out from November 2021, will be in six geographical sectors, with each sector housing at least 40,000 migrant workers both in and out of dormitories, The Straits Times newspaper reported.

Each of the six sectors will be anchored by a medical centre for migrant workers, complemented by onsite medical centres in three large dormitories, at least two mobile clinical teams, as well as round-the-clock telemedicine consultations and ambulance and special transport services.
Tender documents were published by the Ministry of Manpower on June 28 for the new system.

One of the sectors, covering areas in the west like Bukit Batok and Jurong industrial areas, will have its healthcare centre operated by a non-governmental organisation. The sector has about 54,800 workers, of whom more than 82 per cent live in dorms.
Tender documents said that healthcare should be provided in a way that ""minimises any cultural and language barriers to access healthcare services"". Steps to ensure this may include having doctors onsite from workers' home countries and having multilingual translation capabilities.
Providers are also to deliver healthcare in a manner that keeps migrant workers' out-of-pocket expenses low, according to the news report.
Under the new system, each of the six medical centres for migrant workers will be the first-line outpatient facility for migrant workers.
The six centres will also be used for public health surveillance and equipped with testing capabilities and isolation facilities to prevent the spread of diseases like Covid-19. They will be staffed by at least one doctor, two nurses, two administrative support staff and a radiographer.
The new healthcare system for migrant workers follows the roll out of regional medical centres for workers since August 28 last year. There are currently 13, opened after all dormitories were cleared of Covid-19 on August 19 last year.
As of Tuesday, about 87 per cent of Singapore's 62,563 Covid-19 patients were dorm residents (foreign workers), although no new cases have been detected in dorms in the past two weeks.

"Covaxin can be an effective booster shot against variants, say NIV scientists",2842,"PUNE: With SARS-CoV-2 variants likely to define the next phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists at National Institute of Virology (NIV) have said that a booster dose of Covaxin may provide a solution to the menace posed by the evolving virus and offer “long-term protection.”
A booster dose against Covid is being explored in some countries with other vaccines. Similar research is being considered in India too, said ICMR-NIV director Priya Abraham.

A booster shot will come after the first two doses of any vaccine and may have to be given regularly—after a year or two, or later—to keep the immune system primed against SARS-CoV-2 variants. A person receiving a booster will not have to repeat entire two-dose schedule.
“Covaxin could be more effective at tackling emerging variants. It can play a useful role as a booster vaccine because both antibodies and cells of the immune system (mounted by Covaxin) are able to recognise and neutralise more proteins of the virus, apart from the spike protein,” said Abraham.

Booster shots with a whole virus inactivated vaccine have proven to work well after two doses of any vaccine. “Inactivated vaccines, in general, can trigger a strong immune reaction, though it may not be the same as the immune response to live attenuated vaccines. So, a person may need booster shots to ensure long-term protection,” she said.
Some manufacturers have focused solely on making booster shots. One of them is French pharma firm Valneva whose upcoming inactivated vaccine is being currently seen as a prime booster candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK and most of Europe. “Valneva’s inactivated vaccine— VLA2001 —is part of a UK government-funded clinical trial looking at seven ‘booster’ vaccines. Covaxin can be potentially considered as a booster dose as and when that becomes a recommendation in India and also in other countries,” said Abraham.
One of Covaxin’s key selling points is its apparent ability to mount a broader immune response against the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, instead of just focusing on the spike protein. Various studies have found that the vaccine is effective against different ‘variants of concern’.
Asked if the government may consider positioning Covaxin as a booster vaccine against variants, Abraham said: “Such studies are being considered. The Centre has not made such a policy decision yet.”
Booster doses could also be helpful for vaccinated people working in certain environme-nts. Healthcare and frontline workers are most at risk. “They are more likely to be considered for a booster dose as and when the country adopts such a policy. Vulnerable groups like the elde-rly or immune-compromised may also need to be prioritized if studies confirm necessity of booster dose,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a national Covid task force member.

"SGPGIMS, IIT-Kanpur sign MoU, set to nurture smart healthcare",4310,"KANPUR: Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow and IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday signed an MoU to advance innovation in accessible healthcare through indigenous solutions.
Under the MoU, the institutes will set up a centre of excellence in telemedicine and healthcare robotics to nurture smart healthcare with an overarching objective of strengthening healthcare systems. The MoU was signed by Prof. R. K. Dhiman, director, SGPGI and Prof. Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-Kanpur.

Professor Karandikar said, “Through this initiative, two leading institutions of the country will join hands to uphold their vision of a robust, indigenous healthcare system, focused on promoting interdisciplinary innovation. The MoU is a timely step in the right direction to enable an exchange of ideas across engineering and medicine, as professionals from IIT-Kanpur will receive the opportunity to collaborate with specialized doctors at SGPGIMS, Lucknow.”
Through this MoU, IIT-Kanpur and SGPGIMS have agreed to establish an R&D set up for promoting telemedicine aided by information and communication technologies (ICT) and 5G, and point-of-care testing and diagnostics. An integrated network of mobile health vans in rural areas and smart kiosks in urban locales will ensure last-mile connectivity to ascertain availability of emergency healthcare services.

Commenting on the initiative’s vision, Prof. Dhiman said, “We will jointly launch courses in various fields of digital health which are not available in any engineering and medical educational institutions in the country at the moment. Current Corona pandemic has made telemedicine technology very popular and useful tool to bridge the gap between care providers and citizens so there is a need to develop indigenous technology platforms and systems on a large scale which can be affordable and made available widely.”
“This will promote entrepreneurship and develop a rural health system which can be deployed far and wide to strengthen the health system. The future holds the key for a hybrid healthcare system for which the bond between engineering and medical discipline needs to be strengthened. In that context the timing of handshake between the two major institutions is appropriate which is going to yield immense benefit to the society,” he added.
A telemedicine system is about creating a network of expected beneficiaries and medical experts and integrating them together in a digital platform. A cost-effective platform consisting of hardware sensors and IOT controller devices needs to be developed for collecting patient health data. The system has to be integrated with cloud servers and mobile apps. In this regard, the role of IIT -Kanpur will include development of such portable IoT enabled health care systems along with point-of-care testing and diagnostics, designing customized mobile vans and kiosks equipped with AI-based diagnostics, integrating multi-lingual avatars with systems to give patients the feel of the presence of a doctor or a caregiver. The avatars would especially be essential for patients with mental health disorders and elderly care.
SGPGIMS had set up the School of Telemedicine & Biomedical Informatics in the year 2006 with the objective of teaching and training healthcare personnel and clinical engineers tools and strategies of ICT-enabled health care. It has received a major grant-in-aid from ministry of electronics & IT, government of India in 2007 to elevate the school to a national resource centre in telemedicine & biomedical informatics which was continued for five years.
Later, from the year 2007 till date the facility and trained technical human power has been supported by the ministry of health & family welfare, government of India to develop and manage the National Medical College Network as the national resource centre. With the collaboration with IIT-Kanpur and the Centre of Excellence, the engineering aspects of clinical application of digital technologies can be addressed.
Backed with two decades of experience in application-oriented telemedicine research, development, and deployment, SGPGIMS’s collaboration with IIT- Kanpur will foster synergies to cultivate an ecosystem at the intersection of technology and healthcare through capacity development.

Discussions on to speed up vaccine delivery: J&J,1125,"

BENGALURU: Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said on Tuesday that it was in talks with the Indian government to explore ways to speed up delivery of its singleshot Covid-19 vaccine in the country. The company also said as per a recent announcement by the Indian drug regulator, there is no longer a need to conduct bridging clinical trials of the vaccines in India.
The US-based company said in April it was seeking an approval to conduct a bridging clinical study of its Janssen Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India. In May, however, the country scrapped local trials for “well-established” vaccines manufactured in other countries.

Boat-clinic brings healthcare to Brahmaputra islands,4426,"GUWAHATI: Hundreds of villages scattered along the Brahmaputra and its islands have not been getting basic facilities of healthcare for long because of inaccessibility. The recurrent threats of floods make them even more remote.
Lakhimpur and Biswanath districts in the northeastern front of Assam do not even have proper roads for transportation in cases of emergency. The pandemic was a great testing time for this region pointing once again to the fact that connectivity for basic services in education, health and essentials is the need of the hour.

When a fellow villager informed Ruini Milli in Saru Tamuli village under Bortamuli Panchayat in the Gohpur revenue circle in Biswanath that a boat-clinic would soon come to their river-island soon, she could not believe it. But when the floating medical facility actually arrived on June 24 with a team of doctors and paramedics, she was left speechless.
“I have never seen such a beautiful boat-hospital. It crossed the Kharoi tributary of the Brahmaputra and came to our island. The government health department was unable to reach out to us. We have been treated by the doctors, and they have even taken our samples for testing,” said Ruini.

Health activist, Padmashree Dr H Sudarshan, and his team at Karuna Trust launched this facility along the Brahmaputra on June 21 covering six administrative units of Biswanath and Lakhimpur. The state-of-the-art boat clinic will serve around 1.17 lakh people residing along the Brahmaputra. Nearly 70% of this population comprises Mishing tribes, an indigenous community struggling for basics like education and healthcare.
Earlier, villagers like Ruini would cross the mighty river in small boats to seek medical assistance on the other side of the river. She was very grateful to Sudarshan for providing healthcare in her village of 800 people. “We should encourage pregnant women to come for their delivery in the boat clinic,” Ruini said.
The two-storey clinic has a floor space of 1,600 sq ft housing an OPD clinic, in-patient care room with two beds and a minor OT for dressing, suturing and attending medical emergencies.
A solar plant with a five kilowatt capacity has been installed for providing uninterrupted power, essential to run equipment like oxygen concentrators, nebulizers, autoclaves and semi auto analyzers, said Anup Sarmah, director, NE, Karuna Trust.
“In case of serious patients, they are taken to the base facility, Vivekananda Hospital, at Barangabari village in Gohpur. It has 10 in-patient bed facilities with delivery rooms. The medical team, including nurses, return to the base hospital after the day-long medical camp,” he said.
Dr Sanjib Choudhury, a senior medical officer of the project, who has worked in different government and private hospitals in various states since 1984, said the clinic has all primary and emergency healthcare facilities. “This will certainly help provide modern healthcare to villages deprived of such basics because of their geographical location and frequent floods,” he said.
Most river islands lack basic infrastructure and service--from healthcare to education, power, roads, drinking water and sanitation. The chars have one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the state. “In the absence of emergency medical services, it takes four to six hours for a patient from char to reach a district hospital,” said Sarmah.
Pranab Kumar Sarmah, DC of Biswanath, inaugurated the boat clinic on the occasion of International Yoga day in the presence of Aditya Vikram Yadav, SDO, Gohpur, assuring all possible support to the endeavour. In the ongoing vaccination drive, the Biswanath administration is likely to send their vaccinators to these remote villages in the boat-clinic.
The Karuna Trust is a pioneer in providing comprehensive primary healthcare services through the Public Private Partnership mode. It manages 70 government primary health centres in six states. The principal threat to these river islands is the river, floods and erosion. Reaching healthcare under such circumstances is next to impossible.
“Construction of permanent infrastructure and health facilities is one of the major challenges in these islands because of the floods. The boat-clinic will also be used for providing rehabilitation and relief services during natural calamities,” said Sarmah.

‘Release money to kin of dead health workers’: Goa Forward Party,955,"PANAJI: Goa Forward Party on Monday demanded that the state government must immediately release the assured compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the kin of healthcare workers who succumbed to Covid-19. According to the directorate of health services, six healthcare personnel lost their lives due to the pandemic, including three at private hospitals.
Chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced that the state would pay the kin of health care workers Rs 50 lakh if they lost their lives due to Covid. GFP had filed an RTI with the DHS asking if any compensation has been released to the healthcare workers who died due to Covid-19.
“DHS has given us a reply that no compensation has been disbursed to the kin of the healthcare workers. This makes it clear that the chief minister is simply making statements. The government is bankrupt,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat. He also said that Sawant is making false promises to people and healthcare workers.

"No need for death audit, no case of under-reporting of Covid deaths: Bombay high court at Goa",1960,"PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday refused to go into the issue of appointment of any judicial commission to inquire into the deaths at the Goa Medical College (GMC) in May this year or the issue of payment of compensation to the victims. It also turned down the need for a death audit stating that there was no serious case of under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.
Dealing with a petition seeking judicial commission to look into deaths at GMC, the court stated, “There are no particulars as to whether any of the victims have authorised any of the petitioners to raise such a claim. In the state of such pleadings, we refrain from going into the issue of either appointment of a judicial commission, or the issue of payment of compensation.”

It also took into consideration the advocate general’s submission that the Supreme Court is already seized with the issue of payment of ex-gratia compensation to the Covid victims.
Countering the plea seeking death audit, advocate general Devidas Pangam assured the court that at least in Goa, there have been no cases of under-reporting and submitted that there was an issue of private hospitals not accurately reporting Covid deaths. He pointed out that in some cases, even show-cause notices have been issued to the violators and such notices will be disposed of in accordance with the law at the earliest.

“This is yet another reason as to why we do not feel that it is appropriate for us to go into this issue, at this stage and that too, at the behest of the present petitioners.”
The court however directed for a performance audit in respect of the ventilators and other medical equipment in Goa. “The state authorities are also required to take immediate steps to see that the ventilators and other medical equipment are in working condition so that there are no logistical issues in the future,” the high court stated.

"Goa’s positivity rate will drop below 5% in 4 days, says CM",1652,"Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday that the state’s case positivity rate for Covid would drop below 5% in the next four days.
The chief minister told reporters that the Covid situation is “coming under control” in the state, and that the positivity rate is decreasing and the recovery rate is increasing. “Our current positivity rate is 6%, and over the next four days, it will drop below 5%,” he said.
Sawant also said that going by the speed of vaccination, the state government would meet its target of administering the first dose of the vaccine to the eligible population by the end of July.
On Sunday, TOI reported that Sawant said the government would request the high court to allow fully-vaccinated people to enter the state without having to produce a Covid-negative certificate.

On Monday, he said that this arrangement would not be for tourists, but for persons entering the state for business or other purposes. He also said that if a person is fully vaccinated, they would not be required to undergo a rapid antigen or RT-PCR test before entering. When asked about the fact that there is no testing facility at railway stations, he said the government has asked private labs to start testing.
From Saturday, the government has started conducting rapid antigen tests at border checkposts.
Sawant had said that anyone entering the state, whether migrant labourer or tourist, would be tested for Covid-19 at the borders to keep a check on the Delta+ variant.
If the person tests positive at the border checkpost, they would be isolated or admitted to hospital, and if the report is negative, they will be allowed to enter.

NGO to provide free e-health services for primary teachers in Haryana,2123,"CHANDIGARH: As the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure is increasing day by day, Sampark Foundation has launched a free-of-cost online healthline for all primary school teachers in the Haryana. This service will ease the pressure on local doctors and aid in early detection and management of Covid-19.
Given the dearth of doctors on ground and exposure associated while visiting hospitals, many teachers cannot go to doctors, hence Sampark is getting doctors to these teachers. By using the service of e-consultation, teachers will have access to doctors and can avail multiple consultations, for their family members as well.

The campaign, called the ‘Sampark Teacher Healthline’, will be activated across India until the pandemic is under control. On a national level, 25 lakh individuals will benefit from e-consultations and the cost of all transactions will be borne by Sampark Foundation. As part of the campaign, Sampark also aims to educate 1 crore children and their families on precautions to be taken during the pandemic.
Founder-chairman Sampark Foundation Vineet Nayar said, “We have committed an investment of Rs 10 crore to share the burden of teachers and their families in these tough times. I have always had a people first philosophy, at HCL we called it ‘employees first’ and at Sampark we call it ‘teachers first’. Now more than ever, teachers, who have been running a marathon since over a year, need our support and given the situation on ground, I am hopeful that by facilitating free medical consultations for teachers and their families, many lives can be saved by providing the right diagnosis at the right time.”

In support of the ‘Sampark Teacher Healthline’, Nand Kishor Verma, deputy director of academic cell, Haryana education department said, “In these difficult times Sampark Foundation’s initiative is going to benefit teachers and their families immensely. The Sampark Teacher Healthline, will reduce the pressure on local hospitals, resources and doctors, by connecting patients virtually with doctors.”

“This is a testing time for CEOs,” Isaac said. “They need to plan for the situation around them, galvanise the system and work with a distributed workforce who are either working from home or their hometowns.”
Vishal Bali, executive chairman, Asia Healthcare Holdings, said the concern is all about preserving enterprise after preserving human resources, which is different from previous times. “This time, you are using the lens to understand how it impacts your people. Often, cashflows were restricted but we managed and made sure that there was no change in the pay structure.”

Bali said the pandemic has changed the concept of work permanently and the focus now is more on safety and wellbeing.
Ravi Ranjan, SBI general manager, NW-II, Bangalore Circle, said that while the bank’s employees were frontline workers and worked from their branches every day, the bank ensured that people whose roles were not front-facing, worked from home.
“We restricted the number of operations at our branches. That reduced footfall. While most customers used our app, some still came but we also put in place doorstep banking to better assist them,” Ranjan said.
Issac said there were three trends playing out in workplace transformation: Preference for temporary staff or gig employees, adopting a hybrid work model and companies adopting a more humane approach.
“Access to data systems and device agnostic methods have been the biggest push for hybrid work models along with better connectivity,” he said. “Also, companies are taking steps to ensure not to let employees go. We had a huge attrition rate in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic but this time it isn’t so.”
Bali said as people return to offices sometime later this year or next year, corporates are engaging with healthcare providers who are becoming safety nets. “This will keep the office environment safe,” he said.

"Vaccination of 60-plus population sluggish after initial high, experts raise concerns",5556,"NEW DELHI: The pace of vaccination of the 60-plus population has become sluggish in the past few weeks after an initial high, with healthcare experts attributing it to mobility issues and misinformation and unsubstantiated apprehensions about the jabs.
According to Union health ministry data, 2.29 crore elderly people have been fully vaccinated so far while 6.71 crore have received just one dose of Covid-19 vaccine till now.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

The 60-plus population in India was projected to be at 14.3 crore in 2021, so that would imply that just 16 per cent of them have been fully vaccinated till now.
Vaccination for those over 60 years of age and those of 45-plus with co-morbidities started from March 1 at both government and private centres.

Coronavirus: Live updates
On an average about 80.77 lakh vaccine doses were given to the 60-plus population per week between March 13 and April 2, but the weekly figure dropped to about 32 lakh between June 5 to 25, according to the data.
Healthcare experts expressed concern over the slow place of vaccination of the 60-plus people who are more prone to have co-morbidities and remain more susceptible to severe disease.
Dr Sujeet Ranjan, Executive Director of The Coalition for Food and Nutrition Security (CFNS), said myths, misconceptions and rumours about Covid-19 vaccines are the biggest hurdle to vaccination coverage.

NEW DELHI: The Central government will provide more than 19,10,650 Covid-19 vaccine doses to states and Union territories in the next three days, the health ministry said on Saturday. According to the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), as many as 1,45,21,067 balance and unutilised Covid


""Some people think they will never contract Covid-19, others believe that the virus itself is on the way out. Irrational mistrust of scientifically approved vaccines is also a factor. While vaccine hesitancy has always been a phenomenon in our country, today it tends to accentuated by opinions on social media, where even people with no subject expertise but having wide following can influence people,"" he said.
""Some people in rural areas believe that Covid-19 is mostly for urban people. Also, many people have heard on the social media that the vaccine and its side-effects will show up two to three years from now. These rumours, suspicion and fear are making it harder to remove vaccine hesitancy,"" he added.
He said it has also been observed that most public places in rural areas lack senior citizen-friendly infrastructure.
Hospitals have expressed concern over the slow pace of vaccination of 60-plus people who also suffer from the maximum number of comorbidities.
Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said vaccine hesitancy in the elderly population is a very real issue.
""Among many factors, one is a fear that people with previous heart disease will have some issue because of some unfortunate videos that were circulating around. Some people have done their CRP (c-reactive protein) tests also to see if that was raised and then they feel that they should not take the vaccine,"" Bajaj said.
Bajaj said mobility is also a very big issue for the 60-plus age group.
""The most important problem is mobility because they are not really able to visit the vaccination centres themselves and also they have a fear that if they go into a crowded place, they will catch Covid. We need to ensure that we educate them about the various risk factors and try to provide vaccination to them at their doorstep,"" he said.
Dr. Piyush Goel, Senior Consultant- Pulmonary and Critical Care, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, Gurugram, said for mass-scale vaccine coverage, vaccine hesitancy is one of the biggest hurdles.
""As there has been a recent drop in the pace of vaccination among people above the age of 60, there are fears that this vaccine hesitancy can hamper the coverage of this population group most vulnerable to Covid-19,"" he said.
Dr. Roshan Palresha, Consultant - Emergency Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said the recent drop in Covid vaccine coverage among the 60-plus group of people is a cause of concern as they are more prone to have comorbidities, and remain more susceptible to severe disease.
“People aged 60 and more must understand that while the number of infected people may go up or down, their vulnerability to the disease and chances of mortality remain the same, and can be reduced only with vaccines,"" he said.
""In the past we have successfully reduced cases of HIV/AIDS and polio through sustained and focussed media campaigns, and it should help this time too. Government representatives must engage in dialogue with these people and may also come up with non-financial incentives to encourage people,"" he suggested.
Dr. HK Mahajan, Anesthesiologist, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Vasant Kunj, said focus should be on getting across two key vaccine messages — vaccines provide protection against Covid-19 and vaccines are safe.
Mahajan said vaccine hesitancy in people over the age of 60 years in India could also be because of misinformation, myth and skepticism.
To counter this, Mahajan suggested that front-line health workers and hospitals should issue statements in favour of vaccination.
""Influential people like film actors, famous personalities should also be tapped to appeal to the public to get vaccinated,"" he said.

Vaccination of 60-plus population sluggish after initial high; experts raise concerns,5114,"NEW DELHI: The pace of vaccination of the 60-plus population has become sluggish in the past few weeks after an initial high, with healthcare experts attributing it to mobility issues and misinformation and unsubstantiated apprehensions about the jabs.
According to Health Ministry data, 2.29 crore elderly people have been fully vaccinated so far while 6.71 crore have received just one dose of Covid-19 vaccine till now.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

The 60-plus population in India was projected to be at 14.3 crore in 2021, so that would imply that just 16 per cent of them have been fully vaccinated till now.
Vaccination for those over 60 years of age and those of 45-plus with co-morbidities started from March 1 at both government and private centres.

On an average about 80.77 lakh vaccine doses were given to the 60-plus population per week between March 13 and April 2, but the weekly figure dropped to about 32 lakh between June 5 to 25, according to the data.
Healthcare experts expressed concern over the slow place of vaccination of the 60-plus people who are more prone to have co-morbidities and remain more susceptible to severe disease.
Dr Sujeet Ranjan, Executive Director of The Coalition for Food and Nutrition Security (CFNS), said myths, misconceptions and rumours about Covid-19 vaccines are the biggest hurdle to vaccination coverage.
""Some people think they will never contract Covid-19, others believe that the virus itself is on the way out. Irrational mistrust of scientifically approved vaccines is also a factor. While vaccine hesitancy has always been a phenomenon in our country, today it tends to accentuated by opinions on social media, where even people with no subject expertise but having wide following can influence people,"" he said.
""Some people in rural areas believe that Covid-19 is mostly for urban people. Also, many people have heard on the social media that the vaccine and its side-effects will show up two to three years from now. These rumours, suspicion and fear are making it harder to remove vaccine hesitancy,"" he added.
He said it has also been observed that most public places in rural areas lack senior citizen-friendly infrastructure.
Hospitals have expressed concern over the slow pace of vaccination of 60-plus people who also suffer from the maximum number of comorbidities.
Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said vaccine hesitancy in the elderly population is a very real issue.
""Among many factors, one is a fear that people with previous heart disease will have some issue because of some unfortunate videos that were circulating around. Some people have done their CRP (c-reactive protein) tests also to see if that was raised and then they feel that they should not take the vaccine,"" Bajaj said.
Bajaj said mobility is also a very big issue for the 60-plus age group.
""The most important problem is mobility because they are not really able to visit the vaccination centres themselves and also they have a fear that if they go into a crowded place, they will catch Covid. We need to ensure that we educate them about the various risk factors and try to provide vaccination to them at their doorstep,"" he said.
Dr. Piyush Goel, Senior Consultant- Pulmonary and Critical Care, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, Gurugram, said for mass-scale vaccine coverage, vaccine hesitancy is one of the biggest hurdles.
""As there has been a recent drop in the pace of vaccination among people above the age of 60, there are fears that this vaccine hesitancy can hamper the coverage of this population group most vulnerable to Covid-19,"" he said.
Dr. Roshan Palresha, Consultant - Emergency Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said the recent drop in Covid vaccine coverage among the 60-plus group of people is a cause of concern as they are more prone to have comorbidities, and remain more susceptible to severe disease.
“People aged 60 and more must understand that while the number of infected people may go up or down, their vulnerability to the disease and chances of mortality remain the same, and can be reduced only with vaccines,"" he said.
""In the past we have successfully reduced cases of HIV/AIDS and polio through sustained and focussed media campaigns, and it should help this time too. Government representatives must engage in dialogue with these people and may also come up with non-financial incentives to encourage people,"" he suggested.
Dr. HK Mahajan, Anesthesiologist, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Vasant Kunj, said focus should be on getting across two key vaccine messages -- vaccines provide protection against Covid-19 and vaccines are safe.
Mahajan said vaccine hesitancy in people over the age of 60 years in India could also be because of misinformation, myth and skepticism.

During his discussions with Stanley C Erck, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director at Novavax, Sandhu said the partnership between Novavax and SII is another example of the “robust India-US healthcare cooperation”, especially in the manufacturing of affordable and accessible vaccines and medicines.
Erck briefed the ambassador on the high efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine as per trials held so far. In January 2020, Novavax announced development of a coronavirus vaccine candidate. Subsequently Novavax and India's SII had entered into a vaccine manufacture agreement with the Novovax vaccine expected to be distributed as 'Covavax' in India.

On June 14, Novavax had announced overall 90.4 per cent efficacy in Phase-3 trials in US and Mexico.
Sandhu noted that healthcare sectors in both countries have been collaborating through joint research, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge exchange.
The Indian envoy has reached out to a large number of pharma companies in the US. His outreach to vaccine manufacturers/firms in the vaccine supply chain include Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Air Products, AdvaMed, Thermo Fisher, Eli Lilly, Pall Corporation, Antylia, Cytiva, Genentech, Ligand, etc.
Earlier this month, he had also visited Ocugen and Jubilant Pharma facilities.
Founded in 1987, Novavax operates through developing recombinant vaccines. The company, through its recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, produces vaccine candidates to respond to both known and newly emerging diseases.
Its product pipeline focuses on a range of infectious diseases with vaccine candidates in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and the Ebola virus.

Covishield comprises over 90% of 12.76 crore Covid vaccines administered so far

Of the 127,605,870 Covid-19 vaccination jabs administered till now, 11,60,65,107 are of Covishield while 1,15,40,763 are of Covaxin, according to the government's CO-WIN portal.



The samples were collected from healthcare centres in Odisha between March 1 to 10 June. Those who were not fully vaccinated had recieved one dose. While the samples were then sent for laboratory confirmation, there was a likelihood of these individuals being Covid positive given the prevalence of the second wave at the point in time. Given the concerns over infections, it can be assumed that people visited healthcare facilities only if they felt the need to do so.

TIMES VIEW

Delta Plus is a variant of concern. But, on current evidence, as noted virologists point out, an alarmist approach helps none. Let us not forget that many are already grappling with Covid-related mental and physical problems. Nevertheless, it needs to be reasserted that Covid-appropriate behaviour must continue and the vaccination drive further speeded up.


While a significant proportion of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases were fully vaccinated, over 83% of them showed symptoms and only 9.9% of the symptomatic breakthrough infections required hospitalisation, the study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research shows, offering evidence that vaccines protect against severe illness.

ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava had recently said the government is exploring home testing solutions to increase the testing capacity


Out of 361 samples, 76% were found to be positive after 14 days of receiving complete doses of the vaccines. The study is yet to be peer-reviewed. The number of hospitalisations was low and only one death was reported out of the 27 hospitalised individuals. The seropositivity in individuals receiving Covishield (96.7%) was higher than in Covaxin (77.1%).

"‘Vaccine effective, kept 97% Goa Medical College staff safe from Covid’",2922,"PANAJI: Even as the vaccination drive has gained momentum, some people are sceptical and question the efficacy of the jab. Doctors in the state continue to debunk myths and point to statistics that show the number of people who got Covid-19 after either taking the first or both doses is negligible.
Experts said that some ask what is the point of taking the shot if one can get infected even after that, but for instance, out of the 4,500 healthcare workers at Goa Medical College (GMC), less than 150 — either fully or partially vaccinated — got infected, which is about 3%.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.



“More than 90% of doctors and other healthcare workers in GMC have been vaccinated and, despite working in the Covid hospital, fewer than 150 of them contracted the virus. None of them were hospitalised and fatalities were nil,” head of the department of preventive and social medicine at GMC, Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, told TOI.

Kakodkar said that it must be borne in mind by those who are doubtful about the vaccine that the majority of GMC’s doctors and other staff, despite working throughout the second wave when infectivity was high, did not get the infection.
Covid-related fatalities among healthcare workers across the country, he said, was less as compared to the first wave. It was because they were vaccinated when the second wave hit, Kakodkar said.
“Despite the Delta strain being more severe and infectious fewer healthcare workers contracted the virus, also mortalities were less. This proves that the majority will not get the infection if vaccinated. The disease will be mild among those few who may get it,” he said.
It is certain that people who are vaccinated fully with a gap of 84 days between the two doses, receive almost 92% to 94% protection, Kakodkar said. The protective efficacy of the Covishield vaccine when two doses given 84 days apart, is maximum.
“Unvaccinated people are not only vulnerable to infection but 10% to 15% of them will develop moderate disease and 1% to 3 % will die due to the severity of the infection. Severe to moderate infection is definitely prevented by the vaccine,” he said.
Out of the 3,000 Covid deaths reported in the state, the majority were not inoculated. While few died after the first dose and six died despite two doses, all of them had severe co-morbidities, like advanced cancer, kidney disease, heart failure and uncontrolled diabetes, he said.
“We can’t say people have died despite taking the vaccine. They may have died due to their comorbidities. The vaccine has been proven safe and most feared complications at the beginning of the drive, like deaths and anaphylaxis reaction, have not been reported in Goa so far. Whatever reactions were seen among the younger population post-vaccination have been mild, like in the case of any other vaccine, and lasted for two to three days,” Kakodkar said.

“The incident has made many people sceptical about vaccination. A lot of anti-vaccine theories have started doing the rounds on social media too.

"Nagpur: Despite third wave projection, plan for jumbo Covid hospitals dropped",3771,"NAGPUR: With second wave receded and Covid-19 cases plummeting by the day, the plan to develop jumbo Covid hospitals at Mankapur and Wardha has been reportedly dropped. The plan had not materialized even during the peak of first and second waves when patients struggled to find beds. Now, the district will not have a jumbo hospital even if the third wave strikes.
As per the recent projections of the state government, the third wave is likely to arrive in July and August.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.



Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI that there is no need for a jumbo Covid hospital for the district which already has over 8,000 beds, which is highest in the state. “Projection is that third wave will hit hard in rural areas which had not seen many cases in the first and second waves. Also, the vaccination is low in these areas. It’s meaningless to develop jumbo Covid hospital in city and bring patients from rural areas,” he said.

On preparations for the projected third wave, the minister said Rs25 crore approved under corporate social responsibility have been disbursed for strengthening health infrastructure in rural areas. “More funds will be given in coming days. Plan is to provide treatment to patients at their respective tehsils. This will also ease burden on hospitals in city,” he said.
The district had witnessed highly contagious and virulent second wave from third week of February. Active cases had reached record 77,556 on April 25. Around 20% patients require admission, as per the government. Going by this calculation, the district needed enhanced bed capacity.
The cases started declining from beginning of May. Now, the district has reported below 40 cases for the last three days.
Raut on May 8 had directed officials to complete work for jumbo Covid hospital before the third wave strikes. He also said in-principle approval has been received for 600-bedded jumbo hospital proposed at divisional sports complex, Mankapur.
The minister had earlier proposed a 1,000-bed jumbo hospital at Mankapur during the peak of first wave witnessed from third week of August. The plan was dropped in October after cases dropped.
Many patients did not get beds during the peak of second wave in March and April. Few died at homes and reportedly even in ambulances. Many patients were also declared brought dead and died within 72 hours of hospitalization. Again, Raut proposed two jumbo Covid hospitals at Mankapur and at an industry in Wardha.
Corporator Virendra Kukreja said the government is not at all serious about saving lives. “This is the perfect time to prepare for third wave. Mini-jumbo or dedicated hospitals, equipment etc, especially for children, should have been ready by now. Unfortunately, we are likely to witness same hapless situation in third wave due to the government’s negligence,” he said.
According to activist Joseph George, the administration fooled people by announcing jumbo Covid hospitals during peak of first and second waves. “Announcing makeshift facilities is nothing but administration’s attempt to hide its failures. The authorities did not develop permanent Covid hospitals between October last year and February, which led to people’s suffering during the second wave. If not permanent hospitals, jumbo Covid hospital should have been developed by now. Healthcare workers would have started preparations for the third wave at this makeshift facility,” he said.
On Monday, 33 positive cases were detected from 5,533 tests. After zero deaths a day ago, the district registered two deaths. One deceased was from other district and another from rural area. There was no death in rural for eight days. The city reported zero death for the fourth consecutive day.

Similar advisories had gone to the states/UTs earlier on April 27 and June 9, suggesting various remedial measures to check recurrence of such incidents against healthcare professionals, ensuring adequate security at healthcare facilities including Covid-19 designated hospitals. For the hospitals, the suggestions included controlled and restricted access to the premises; facilitation centers at the entry point to provide information as well as sharing of authenticated information regarding medical resources with the public through website, helpline, etc; deployment of quick response police teams at vulnerable locations with effective communication/ security gadgets; effective local-level medical intervention along with well-equipped centralized control room for monitoring and quick response, etc.
Bhalla said a close watch may be kept on any objectionable content in social media which may exacerbate such situations. “Concerted efforts should be made through posters in hospitals, social media, etc. to emphasize the valuable contribution being made by doctors and other healthcare personnel in the fight against Covid-19,” he suggested while requesting the states/UTs to take measures to secure healthcare professionals on priority and proactively engage with members of the medical fraternity to assuage their concerns.

Doctors protest in Delhi over violence against healthcare professionals,2832,"NEW DELHI: Several doctors on Friday held protests here as part of a nationwide stir called by the IMA against the recent incidents of violence against healthcare professionals in some parts of the country, and to demand a central law to curb such cases.

FAIMA founder Dr Manish Jangra told reporters that the AIIMS RDA is not part of the protest but members of IMA and FAIMA are leading the protest, and ""we will be having a protest at RML Delhi too at 1pm near the hostel"".
FAIMA lodges its strong protest against the ""recent incidents of violence"" against doctors, he said.

The call for the nationwide protest was issued by the IMA, which on Thursday had said that around 3.5 lakh doctors of the association will participate in it.
IMA national president Dr J A Jayalal had said that besides its members, a number of organisations such as the Association of Physicians of India, the Association of Surgeons of India, the Medical Students Network and Junior Doctor Network will participate in the protest.
The IMA had said in a statement on Thursday that in Bihar and central Kerala, doctors will close their clinics in the morning to press for the demand of a central law against violence against doctors. In the evening, public interaction has been arranged to form a coordination team in each branch of IMA to stop such violence from taking place.
The Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishment (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019, which sought to impose a jail term up to 10 years for assaulting on-duty doctors and other healthcare professionals was opposed by the Home Ministry, saying the special law was not feasible as health is a state subject.
""There are many central health laws such as the PCPNDT Act and the Clinical Establishment Act. Currently, 21 states have local laws, but what we need is a strong central law to protect doctors from violence,"" the doctors' body said.
Cases of violence against doctors and other healthcare workers have been reported lately from some parts of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir and Assam among other places.
On June 1, a doctor at a medical facility in Hojai in Assam was allegedly assaulted by attendants following the death of a patient suffering from Covid and pneumonia at Udali Model hospital.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had later taken cognisance of the case and asked the Assam government and the state police chief to inquire into the alleged assault and take ""needful, preventive and punitive action"" in the case."

Minimum 71L jabs per day a must for eco recovery: CII,2470,"Panaji: India’s economic recovery hinges on an accelerated vaccination with at least 71.2 lakh individuals being vaccinated on a daily basis, said Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Thursday as it urged the government to put in place a multi-pronged strategy to stimulate economic growth.
Vaccination is a key factor that will aid India’s recovery and the Centre needs to increase vaccine production in order to ensure that a majority of the country’s population is vaccinated by December end.

India’s GDP growth rate for 2021-22 could touch 9.5% if public expenditure, reforms and vaccination are accelerated, said CII president T V Narendran in an online media interaction.
“With majority of the population vaccinated by the end of this year, implementation of big-ticket reforms in factor markets and the financial sector, and a large fiscal stimulus, we will be able to reach the critical $5 trillion mark by 2025-26,” Narendran said.

India could witness strong growth in the second half of the current financial year if supported by “robust external demand and largescale coverage of vaccination,” said Narendran.
CII has suggested a range of measures to speed up the vaccination drive. It estimates that an average of about 71 lakh daily vaccinations are required between June to December to administer at least a single dose to all adults in the country. CII has also recommended that an empowered minister of vaccination needs to be appointed to accelerate the vaccination programme, procurement and distribution of vaccines to states.
The government should fast track all necessary licencing requirements and pay vaccine manufacturers in advance for purchases, besides providing capital subsidies to incentivise production. It should urge the IP owners of vaccines to issue licences for mass manufacturing with transfer of technology.
To combat vaccine hesitancy, governments at the Centre and at the state-level need to rope in social influencers and also provide cash, food and insurance incentives.“The cumulative impact of the two waves on incomes and consumer sentiment, coupled with the increase in household medical expenses in the second wave, is likely to affect consumer demand for some time. As the economy reopens post the second wave, a dual-pronged Government strategy is required to boost consumption and support industry till demand is well-entrenched,” he said.

Citizens, who have been putting off non-emergency surgeries out of Covid fears, have started approaching hospitals to schedule surgeries meant for weight loss, kidney/gall bladder stone, bone joints/muscle, among others.

“We have achieved almost 75% resumption of non-Covid healthcare services, mainly elective surgeries, after the relaxation of curbs this month. This is fairly pre-pandemic and near the normalcy stage. However, there is a need to stay alert and keep an eye on any new spike in Covid cases,” said Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital.
Hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “Prior to the pandemic, our surgeons were conducting an average of 60-70 elective surgeries every day. They are doing 40-50 such surgeries every day now.”

Sharing the view, senior surgeon Shashank Shah said of Laparo-Obeso Centre, one of the dedicated bariatric surgery units in Pune, said, “We have carried out 20 bariatric surgeries, besides 10 cancer, eight hernia, four gall bladder and 10 intestinal obstruction surgeries so far this month. These patients were mainly the citizens who have been deferring the surgeries for over three months now in view of the Covid surge. They were just managing with painkillers and other supportive drugs during this period.”
The state-run Sassoon General Hospital, which is the referral tertiary care centre, has recorded 85% resumption of elective surgeries. “Many patients from the city’s slums and rural parts are coming for various ailments that necessitate surgery. We are planning or prioritising their surgeries as per the level of urgency and possibilities of complications,” said hospital’s dean Muralidhar Tambe.
Although the number of people testing positive for Covid -19 was unprecedented during the second surge, the patient recovery rate was also faster as compared to the first wave last year, health experts said.
“Therefore, the elective surgeries are expected to touch normal levels faster now than the first wave,” said Abrarali Dalal , chief executive officer, Sahyadri Hospitals.
“Elective surgeries dropped by 60% in April-May this year, whereas, in June 2021, there is a good pick up of 80-85% in planned surgeries, which is near normalcy pre-pandemic stage,” Dalal said.
Delaying medical care may increase medical complications. Hence, people should seek medical care in time, the experts advised. “We have all infection control protocols in place. Hence, citizens who are advised elective surgeries by their consultants should get themselves operated at bigger hospitals in time,” said Vinod Sawantwadkar, chief executive officer, Jehangir hospital.

“Goa needs a repositioning and Goans should work to build a consensus among the people, by giving them a way forward that allows for their recovery, their growth and their future,” the GFP chief said.
He further said that Goa’s repositioning needs to focus on the three main goals of recovery, sustenance, and future readiness.

“We cannot allow Goa to be seen only through the lens of rave parties, and cheap holidays. We need to bring back the credibility and integrity of our state. We need to bring back the respect and reverence of our people, our culture, our traditions and our way of life,” the former deputy chief minister said.
Sardesai blamed the BJP for tarnishing Goa’s reputation, destroying the state’s economy and reducing Goa’s credibility.
He said that restoring Goa’s credibility and aiding the state’s recovery is “a collective exercise”for which a “united opposition” that can “take on the BJP” is vital.

Another doctor said it is the non-vaccinated population that is likely to be badly hit by the third wave. “Vaccination must be completed as soon as possible. The virus will now no longer find a host in the older population that have been largely vaccinated and will move to the younger population that is unprotected by vaccination and by contamination,” the doctor said.

“The children and 18-44 who haven’t been vaccinated are expected to fall in the high risk groups for the next wave,” the doctor added. After walk-in vaccinations opened for 18- 44 population on Sunday, as many as 14,000 to 18,000 persons are being vaccinated each day.

They told the villagers both senior citizens and youth who were present that the vaccine can save lives especially those of the younger generation.
Chairperson of the commission Vidhya Gaude said the primary reason the population there was not vaccinated was due to lack of access to the vaccination centres. “They told us they were ready to get vaccinated but they didn’t have easy access to the vaccination centre and had to travel a very long distance to take their jab. After we found this out, the local MLA and deputy chief minister arranged a session for accessible to them,” she said.

“We are now identifying other remote areas where people haven’t been inoculated in Canacona and Sanguem. We have also asked sarpanchs to keep informed of areas where awareness sessions are needed,” she said.

Covid: KFC offers new schemes,3601,"KOCHI: Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) has introduced new schemes and benefits for entrepreneurs in the state to cope with the hard times amidst the spread of the Covid - 19 pandemic.
One-year principal moratorium will be granted to the MSME enterprises financed by KFC. The loans of such enterprises will also be restructured as per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) thereby preventing such accounts being categorized as non-performing assets. The scheme is available to the loans which were in standard category till March 31, 2021 and will be allowed on the basis of applications from the promoters received until 30th September 2021. No charges or additional interest will be charged for this facility.

Last year, KFC had sanctioned 20% additional loan to its customers whose repayment was prompt until 31st of March 2020. Now, the second wave of COVID-19 has once again affected the tourism sector and small industries. Entrepreneurs in these sectors will be allowed an additional 20% top up to their loan in addition to the 20% provided last year, taking the lot to 40%. The scheme has been formulated in line with the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) of the Central Government.
Loans by banks under the ECLGS will be guaranteed by the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company Ltd. However, this facility is not available to KFC. Therefore, KFC has formulated a similar scheme with more benefits to its customers. While banks lend only 20% of the outstanding balance in the customer’s account, KFC lends up to 20% of the disbursed amount, thereby allowing a higher amount to its customers.

Furthermore, while the central scheme provides loans only to the tourism sector, KFC has also included Small Enterprises and the Healthcare Sector under the scheme. There will be a 24 months moratorium period for principal repayment in the scheme. Since interest is payable during this period as well, customers will have the option of adjusting it against the loan.
The finance minister had announced in the state budget that assistance would be provided to entities manufacturing products that help prevent the spread of the disease KFC has come up with a new plan for such ventures. The scheme will be available to all sectors involved in COVID prevention in the field of healthcare, like hospitals, laboratories, units involved in oxygen storage and distribution, manufacturing of ventilators, oxymeters, and other life-saving equipment.
Loans up to Rs 50 lakh to such enterprises will be covered under the Chief Minister's Entrepreneurship Scheme and will be provided at 7% interest with a tenure of 5 years. For loans above Rs 50 lakh, the interest rate will be 7% up to Rs. 50 Lakh and interest for the remaining portion will be fixed as per the rating of the entity. The repayment period available is up to 10 years. Up to 90% of the total cost of the project will be financed under the scheme.
KFC has slashed the interest rates to Healthcare, Tourism and MSME sectors. The minimum interest rate to these sectors has been reduced from 9.5 per cent to 8 per cent. The higher interest rates slab has also been reduced to 10.5 per cent from 12 per cent. Interest rates are determined on the basis of the rating of the entity.
The lower interest rate is usually applied from the loan reset date (month of borrowing) of the respective enterprise. But it has been decided that on this occasion, the benefit of a lower interest rate will be available to all eligible customers from July 1, 2021.

All those who have passed Class XII are eligible to become community nursing assistants. They must be above 18 years and applications will be accepted on a first come, first serve basis.
“In case a third wave emerges, we may also witness a shortage of medical and paramedical staff as we had seen during the first and second waves. Keeping that in mind, the government has devised a big plan of training 5,000 health assistants. In technical terms, they are called community nursing assistants,” the chief minister said while addressing a press conference on the planned manpower augmentation.

They will be given basic training for two weeks. The training will start from June 28 in batches of 500, and each batch will be trained for two weeks. Later, they will be paid according to the number of days they work, the chief minister said.
The community nursing assistants will be trained in basic nursing, paramedic work, lifesaving, first aid, home care, sample collection, and oxygen concentrator and cylinder operations, among others, Kejriwal said. “They will be trained for basic things such as how to measure oxygen and blood pressure, and how to administer vaccines. They will also be trained in patient care, diaper changing, use of catheter and bedpan, sample collection, and use of oxygen mask.”
The government believes that better manpower support will boost efficiency of doctors. The community nursing assistants will work as assistants to doctors and nurses. They will be assigned task by doctors and nurses and will not take any decision on their own, the chief minister pointed out.
For the past 10 days, Delhi government has been ramping up healthcare and oxygen infrastructure against a possible third Covid-19 wave.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had then announced an on-tap liquidity window for banks worth Rs 50,000 crore to extend credit to health services and vaccine manufacturers until March 2022.
The government also last month separately announced including airlines and hospitals in a $41-billion emergency credit program to cushion them from the impact of the pandemic. That program guarantees loans worth Rs 2 crore to hospitals and clinics to set up on-site oxygen generation plants, with interest rates capped at 7.5%.
There is also room for expanding the overall size of that program, the people said.

Fully-vaccinated too showing due for second shot,1168,"PUNE: A massive data scrubbing is now under way on CoWin to find and remove the names of fully-vaccinated people who are still being shown on the app as due for a second vaccine shot.
Public health officials said an early assessment has revealed that Maharashtra has at least one lakh such beneficiaries — mostly healthcare and frontline workers. It is unclear how many such people are there in other cities.

Officials suspect many healthcare and frontline workers — faced with delays — may have registered again with different phone numbers and IDs to get the second dose. These duplicate records are now being removed or merged, officials said, adding that the problem was detected during routine data-correction exercises.
State immunization officer DN Patil said, “It’s difficult to say why so many had to re-register to get the second shots. This could have happened in case of healthcare and frontline workers who found themselves unable to get their second shots after the vaccine drive opened for citizens. These workers may have re-registered under the 60-plus or 45-plus age groups.”

Covid crisis worsened corruption in European Union: watchdog,2870,"BERLIN: The pandemic has worsened corruption across the European Union, Transparency International said Tuesday, with citizens at times needing personal connections to get medical care and some governments using the crisis for their own gain.
The anti-graft watchdog surveyed more than 40,000 people in the EU's 27 member states between October and December 2020.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

On average, it found that 29 percent had relied on favours or well-connected friends and family to access public sector health services last year.
Six percent of respondents resorted to paying an outright bribe.

""Healthcare, in particular, has been a corruption hotspot as governments struggled to manage the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Transparency said in its annual report of people's experiences and perceptions of graft in the EU.
Bribery rates in the health sector were highest in Romania (22 percent) and Bulgaria (19 percent), while leaning on personal connections happened most often in the Czech Republic (54 percent) and Portugal (46 percent).
Many respondents also said their governments weren't handling the pandemic in a transparent manner.
In France, Poland and Spain, 60 percent of respondents or more felt that way.
Transparency International called the findings ""particularly worrying in the current context"".
""Not only are Covid-19 sufferers in need of medical support, but governments across the EU are rolling out vaccinations to protect those most vulnerable to the virus and are creating plans to allocate billions of euros for post-pandemic recovery.
""Corruption threatens all these activities,"" it said, urging EU governments to ""redouble their efforts to ensure a fair and equitable recovery from the ongoing pandemic"".
The report's authors singled out Hungary and Poland as countries using the crisis as ""an excuse to undermine democracy"" by imposing regulations that weaken democratic institutions.
Other politicians saw it ""as a chance to make a profit"", they said, pointing to lobbying for face-mask procurement and lobbying scandals that have ensnared several German lawmakers.
Looking beyond the health crisis, the survey found that a third of EU residents think corruption as a whole is getting worse in their country, although there were huge regional differences.
Overall, almost half said their government is doing a bad job at tackling the problem.
Respondents were especially wary of the ""cosy relationships"" between governments and the private sector, and the apparent ease with which companies can trim their tax bills.
""These results should be a wake-up call,"" said Michiel van Hulten, director of Transparency International EU.
""There are many immediate actions that can be taken,"" he said, ""such as increasing lobbying transparency both at the EU and national levels and tackling tax avoidance.""

PE/VC investments fall in May to $3.6 billion: Report,2517,"MUMBAI: Private equity and venture capital investments more than halved to $3.6 billion in May 2021 when compared to the preceding April's $7.5 billion and a third lower than the year-ago period's $5.4 billion, a report said on Monday.
However, on a year to date basis, the venture investments by these two categories of investors have doubled to USD 20 billion for the first five months of 2021, the report by industry lobby IVCA and consultancy firm EY said, stressing that investors continue to remain bullish.

It can be noted that the country underwent the ravages of the second wave of the pandemic since April this year. There were localised lockdowns across the country in May 2021, while there were $4.6 billion in investments in Jio Platforms in May 2020 despite the national lockdown.
“Investors will be closely watching the Government's preparedness to avert/deal with a possible third wave, better vaccine rollout and the impact of the pandemic on the country's macro and fiscal health in the coming months,” EY partner Vivek Soni said.

He flagged the rise in global inflation, its impact on commodity prices and the US Fed's reaction to rein in inflation as the key risks for India.
The report said the surge in deal activity in 2021 is led by “Covid resilient sectors” like e-commerce (which has received $4.3 billion in investments), technology ($3.8 billion), pharma ($1.4 billion), media and entertainment ($1.2 billion), education ($885 million) and healthcare ($801 million).
“We expect this 'polarisation' of investments to continue till the outlook on pandemic related lockdowns and disruptions changes materially,” Soni said.
From a deal numbers perspective, the 60 transactions in May 2021 were almost at par with the year-ago period, but lower than the 70 recorded in April.
The real estate and infrastructure investments at over $1 billion helped the overall deal number in May, as pure-play PE and VC deal investments were down 54 per cent at $2.5 billion.
From an exits perspective, May 2021 recorded divestments of $12 billion to emerge as the second-best month till date, it said, adding that capital markets driven exits will increase meaningfully as a number of Indian 'unicorns' like Zomato and Paytm follow up on their IPO plans.
Total fundraises in May came at $154 million compared to $50 million of May 2020, and included Motilal Oswal raising $89 million in the first close of its fifth real estate fund.

IIT-Madras research calls for greater govt investment in healthcare sector,2165,"CHENNAI: A study by Indian Institute of Technology - Madras has called for greater government investment in public healthcare to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the elderly.
The current pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may lead to greater adverse health impact.

This is a modal window.

The poor among the elderly would suffer more than others. As a result, their access to regular primary healthcare services and continuity of care that is essential for those suffering from non-communicable diseases, given their dependency and lack of mobility, may have worsened further during this pandemic.
Overall, given the evidence on the possible hardships that the elderly may have already gone through during the pandemic and hardships that they may face in the future, the importance of strengthening the public health care system cannot be over-emphasized, the researchers opine.

Based on the 75th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS) 2017-18, only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance and therefore they may not be able to bear large expenditures on health; and 27.5% of people whose age is 80 years or above are immobile and 70% of elders are partially or wholly financially dependent on others.
Elaborating on the important findings of the study, V R Muraleedharan, department of humanities and social sciences, IIT-Madras, said, “Our research highlights ways in which the elderly may have suffered even due to Covid-19 control measures, such as social/physical distancing that could increase depression, and lead to a higher chance of inflammatory response in the elderly. There are several such ailments specific to the vulnerable elderly population. These are highlighted empirically, supported by other studies carried out in other country settings during the current pandemic.”
The researchers want to extend the result of this study to a policy. They plan to carry out detailed surveys among the elderly population particularly in Tamil Nadu, especially to design effective rehabilitative care which is almost absent in India’s public healthcare system.

Odisha’s June Covid deaths touch 600,2010,"BHUBANESWAR: With the state reporting 45 Covid deaths on Sunday, the toll in June so far has touched 600. Though the state saw 45 deaths a day, on an average, in June (up from 40 in May), its June Covid count dropped by almost 50% of any single-day’s infections in the whole of May.
The state on Saturday recorded 47 deaths, the highest-ever in a day since the pandemic broke out in March last year. It has been reporting pending deaths in a staggered manner after audit by a committee set up for the purpose.

Healthcare experts attributed the mismatch of the rising death figures and falling one-day infections to the delay in the release of the audit reports. “When the state used to witness anywhere between 10,000 to 12000 cases, the number of deaths used to be at least 35 to 40. Though the daily count has come down, the daily fatalities are hovering over 50. So the death figures in the public domain are not the latestfatalities,” a healthcare expert said.
On Sunday, the state’s positivity rate stood at 7.2% with 62,034 samples being tested and 4,469 returning positive. The TPR has been consistent for two consecutive days.

At least 15 districts — mostly the southern and western ones — reported cases in double digits. The western districts with a low infection count were Bargarh (85), Balangir (56), Boudh (90), Deogarh (23), Kalahandi (92), Nuapada (14), Sambalpur (61), Jharsuguda (27) and Sonepur (60). The southern districts with double-digit cases were Gajapati (26), Ganjam (43), Kandhamal (28), Koraput (87), Malkangiri (75). The northern district of Keonjhar also reported double-digit cases with 96 infections.
The eight coastal districts, including Khurda (612), have been reporting more than 100 cases on a daily basis. The government authorities feel the dip in the coastal part of the state will finally determine the weakening impact of the second wave as these districts had seen a spurt not too long ago.

"Half of healthcare, frontline staff in Maharashtra yet to get 2nd jab, says Centre",2803,"MUMBAI: Nearly five months since the start of the nationwide Covid vaccination drive, less than 56% of healthcare and 47% of frontline workers have taken the second dose in Maharashtra, the Centre has said. The state features along with 18 others that have administered fewer second doses than the national average. Maharashtra has started a drive to trace all those who have missed the second dose.
Maharashtra numbers show that while 12.23 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) have taken the first dose since January 16, a little over 7.87 lakh have taken the second dose. Similarly, while nearly 20 lakh frontliners have been vaccinated with one dose, the number of fully vaccinated people in the category is merely 8 lakh. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on data provided by the state show that the ratio of fully vaccinated people in both categories, considered crucial since they are at the frontline, are 52% and 42%, respectively.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

Union health secretary Shri Rajesh Bhushan, in a recent meeting with states, called the incomplete vaccination of the two categories a matter of “serious concern”. Dr Archana Patil, director of health services, said that issues like duplicate entries and use of another mobile number at the time of taking the second dose could be pulling down the numbers of those fully vaccinated. “We are compiling that and also following up with these two categories to get vaccinated on a priority basis,” she said, adding that all districts have been asked to look into their second dose coverage. Vaccination for healthcare workers had started on January 16 and that of frontline workers on February 3.
In Mumbai, civic officials said it has been a matter of intrigue why second dose recipients were low in attendance. For 1.87 lakh and 2.34 lakh healthcare and frontline workers who have taken the first dose, 64% and 55% have turned up for the second. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, said all ward offices have been working to trace “drop-outs”. “Duplication of entries appears to be a more plausible reason than hesitancy,” she said. But it would be clear once the data has been cleaned, she added.

A similar trend is unfolding in the big cities of Thane district as well. Kalyan has seen barely 42% HCWs taking the second jab till June, which means only 6,795 of the total 16,024 workers have turned up. In Thane city, only 15,569 of the 23,887, or around 65%m took both doses, while in Navi Mumbai, 62% of 32,445 took both doses.
“It is surprising HCWs have not yet been immunized completely though the drive started as early as mid-January” said Dr Mahesh Bedekar, adding that HCWs should lead by example and get immunised completely at first.

Access where there is none: These doctors are a call away,2744,"NEW DELHI: Arpit Jain, a doctor at a private hospital in the city, takes out at least an hour every day from his busy schedule to take calls from rural belts in Uttar Pradesh and other states for tele-consultation. Jain is part of a drive called India Against Corona.
Initiated by co-founder Mohit Raj of Turn Your Concern Into Action (TYCIA), the drive is providing medical help, vaccine accessibility and food to the most vulnerable tribal and rural areas in 16 states across the country.

No compatible source was found for this media.

Jain, who has been practising as a doctor for a year, decided to join when he was told about how rural areas, without much medical infrastructure, need assistance to fight Covid-19. “It was then that I offered to help out.”
“Many doctors in India were tied up over the past few weeks due to the current wave. But we started tele-consulting recently as part of the Doctors for Diaspora group. We are trying to reach out to doctors of Indian origin who are practising abroad and can speak local languages.”

Another volunteer, Divya Gupta, said, “We connected multiple groups together through a network.” She said they were trying to ensure that nobody in these vulnerable areas stayed deprived of basic resources.
Jain said tele-consulting rural folks had made him realise the extent of the problem of lack of resources in these areas. “Even to get a test done, many people have to travel around 70km. Many do not have any idea about their medical history. I have worked with tribal populations in the past and know how a large population relies on just one doctor. So we are reaching out to those with mild and moderate fever.”
He added that many people were also unwilling to get vaccinated as they feared side-effects or believed in rumours. “Vaccine hesitancy is a big problem in those areas.”
This is what TYCIA is working on. “Our team has been working for over 15 years with vulnerable groups at multiple places. We have a network of individuals, NGOs and others who are working on vaccine awareness and accessibility,” said Raj.
As part of Covid relief, he said, a collective called Kasbai was created, which includes over 1,000 frontline workers in small towns and villages.
TYCIA has collaborated with multiple bodies to provide healthcare. “We connect people with doctors through tele-consultation and also provide them information on availability of hospital beds and facilities like ambulances. We also work to make sure that people get ration kits,” Raj said.
The organisation is working with 80 vulnerable groups, including those living in tribal belts, those who face societal taboos such as sex workers, and migrant labourers who do not have necessary documents.

“Initially, during the second wave, Candolim PHC area was one of the hotspots. Today, it’s come down to 2% positivity and the credit for this goes to Dr Roshan Nazareth, the health officer in-charge of Candolim PHC. There are some people who make the extra effort to make a difference, and hence I thought I should come here and show my appreciation to Dr Roshan and all those who have worked to bring down the cases at the PHC,” the health minister said.
Minister for ports and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who was also present, said, “At one point, Candolim PHC had the second highest number of cases in the state after Margao. The PHC staff and others worked hard to bring the caseload down to almost nil.”

Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes, who was instrumental in starting the offsite vaccination centre for the PHC, said, “Candolim was going through a bad phase. We, through Michael Lobo, approached the chief minister and health minister and they immediately came to our assistance and started the vaccination centre. They said the village panchayat can take over the vaccination, and in a very short time we managed to bring down the number of cases.”
Both Rane and Lobo urged people to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest.

Fake Covid medicines recovered in Noida: FIR against firm owner,2612,"GREATER NOIDA: An FIR has been lodged against the owner of the fake firm Max Relief Healthcare who had been arrested by the Mumbai police in connection with the alleged manufacture of fake medicines like Favipravir and Azithromycin used in Covid treatment.
The action comes after a raid on the factory of the accused in Ecotech III where the medicines were being packaged and distributed from.

A consignment of Rs 25 lakh of fake medicines was recovered.
Officials said that the accused used to give orders to another accused Sandeep Mishra who has a valid license for manufacturing drugs but had started manufacturing spurious drugs during the pandemic as demand rose.

It has also come to fore that the accused Sudeep Mukherjee had first tied up with the owner of an Ayurvedic company and used his premises and equipment for packaging the fake drugs.
However, Sudeep later shifted to Udyog Kendra in Ecotech III after he purchased his own packaging material and equipment.
“Mishra owns his own factory in Meerut’s Kharsoda from where he had been manufacturing medicines. He has a license from the drug department to do so. However, the accused saw an opportunity in the pandemic and as the demand for medicines used in Covid treatment increased, they started manufacturing spurious drugs,” he said.
While Sudeep was getting the medicines package at the Dirghaayu Ayurvedic company in Derin village in the Ecotech III area, later he had a fallout with the firm’s owner.
“Sudeep first paid Amit for some time for using his packaging machine but later shifted the unit and started using the factory at Udyog Kendra as the packaging unit,” Kumar said.
Ecotech III police has issued a notice to the owner of the Dirghaayu Ayurvedic company to explain their association with Sudeep.
It has been confirmed that the accused Sudeep would source consignments of the fake medicines from Mishra’s factory in Meerut and they would be packaged here before in Greater Noida being distributed across Mumbai.
Cops are preparing to take the accused Sudeep on police custody remand and will soon issue a warrant for the same.
An FIR has been lodged in the case against Sudeep under sections 420 (cheating), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 276 (sale of drug as a different drug or preparation) and sections 18/27 of the drug and cosmetic act.
Police said while they also raided the company premises in Derin village, the accused had removed most of the evidence from there but some medicine strips etc were recovered from the Dirghaayu Ayurvedic company.

The hospital was offering Covishield at the drive-in facility at Rs 1,400 per dose. “We had put up tents, installed air-conditioners and made other arrangements to make the vaccination process convenient. With reduction in vaccine price, running the special facility became unviable,” he added.

While government hospitals offer Covid-19 vaccine for free, the government has notified that private hospitals will charge Rs 780 for a shot of Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V. These include taxes as well as Rs 150 as service charge.
Many private hospitals have raised concerns that the service charge for vaccination capped at Rs 150 may not be adequate for them to organise sessions outside of hospital. However, the government has clarified, the ceiling may not apply to off-site camps.

“Fortis healthcare has taken several initiatives to make vaccination available in residential areas and workplaces, providing ease and convenience to senior citizens and corporate employees. Unfortunately, the cap of Rs 150 will not cover the additional costs incurred for such off-site vaccination camps that involve substantial cost like ambulance, transport, extra staff and doctor,” the Fortis group said in a statement recently.

IIT-Bombay alumni donate Rs 25 crore for digital healthcare centre,2572,"MUMBAI: Two distinct paths emerge after high school. Those wanting to pursue engineering take the PCM (physics, chemistry, math) route and the ones moving towards healthcare follow the PCB (physics, chemistry, biology) road, and never do the twain meet.
But the booming digital healthcare space will see the coming together of technology and healthcare at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Its alumni, Rekha and Rizwan Koita have donated Rs 25 crore for setting up of the ‘Koita Centre for Digital Health’ (KCDH).

Under the aegis of the Koita Foundation, KCDH will focus on driving academic programmes, carry out research and deepen industry collaboration in digital health. Improving the quality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare is one of the world’s biggest priorities.
“This is a niche area and we are moving out of our zone. We will need hand holding from industry. We will need to hire faculty, we will need doctors and other medical professionals on board. This programme will be a part of the Interdisciplinary Dual Degree programme and students after their BTech can leverage their skills to join this centre,” said IITB director Subhasis Chaudhuri. “At KCDH, we hope to enable seamless cross-functionality across these streams. We hope this new initiative will open up exciting opportunities for our graduates, including spearheading research, launching startups, and more,” he added.

TOI had written about IIT-B’s foray into this area on May 10. Following that, the idea matured fast, and with this fund infusion, the tech college is now setting up a full-fledged school in the domain. “Can you book an ICU bed at the click of a button? Similarly, which is the best hospital for cardiac surgery in Mumbai? These matrices are just not collected. Digital healthcare will empower patients to make informed decisions,” said Rizwan.
While India may be at a nascent stage in the area of digital healthcare, worldwide, the healthcare informatics market is estimated to be $125 billion. In India too, the launch of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) in 2020 is expected to drive digital health adoption at a national scale.
Koita Foundation will work with the new center to help scale its operations and work with digital health partners on joint digital health initiatives like internships and research programs. In addition, Koita Foundation will help the center at IIT-B establish industry relationships in healthcare technology, medical device companies, etc.

"Five months on, 23% of healthcare workers in Bengaluru yet to get jab",2515,"BENGALURU: Nearly five months on since the vaccination drive opened for them, only 77% of registered beneficiaries under the healthcare workers (HCWs) category in Bengaluru have taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while only 42% have got both the doses. The drive to inoculate these Covid warriors began on January 16.
Of the over 2.5 lakh HCWs registered in Bengaluru, more than 1.9 lakh have got at least one jab as at 9am on June 7, state health and family welfare department data shows. Of all the districts, coverage among HCWs is the worst in Bengaluru.

This is a modal window.

However, coverage among frontline workers (FLWs) in Bengaluru stands at 92%: While 2 lakh of the 2.2 lakh registered beneficiaries have got at least one jab, 21% (over 45,000) have got both jabs.
Across Karnataka, 81% or 7.3 lakh of the nearly 9 lakh registered HCWs have got at least one dose, while 53% or 4.8 lakh are completely vaccinated. Of the 7.6 lakh FLWs, 6.4 lakh or 85% have taken the first dose and 2.2 lakh or 29% have had both doses.

Anti-vaccine propaganda and hesitancy are still rampant among HCWs, doctors admit. Sources say coverage is better among those employed in the private sector than in government.
Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said about 50% of HCWs were infected during the second wave. “Most had taken at least one dose of the vaccine, but still contracted the virus as they work in high viral load areas,” he said. “They all had mild infections. However, those who did not take the jab and were infected by the virus will have to wait three months from the time of recovery to get vaccinated.”
Health department officials said a majority of those who missed out on vaccination are nursing college students, healthcare staffers working in non-allopathy hospitals and Ayush doctors.
“Pregnant women and lactating mothers did not take the vaccine earlier. Now, lactating mothers can take the vaccine, as per revised guidelines. However, there are many others who did not take the vaccine. Vaccination is a voluntary process,” said a senior officer from the health department.
In some medical education institutions, there were issues with regards to double entry of students. The list of registered beneficiaries included all those who had enrolled in courses as on August 2020. “Several students who had passed out of nursing colleges are still appearing as unvaccinated,” an official said.

Chennai: Doctors perform liver transplant on Covid-19 patient in coma,1693,"CHENNAI: An accidental dose of rat poison pushed a 26-year old national-level kabaddi player from Puducherry into coma, after he developed acute liver failure in May. Doctors incidentally found he was positive for Covid-19. But a liver transplant saved his life. On Thursday, doctors at the MGM healthcare declared him fit for discharge.
When he first met a doctor in Puducherry, Raghul Gandhi had jaundice. His condition worsened and he slipped into a deep coma two days later. “We thought there was little hope when he was shifted to our hospital. Yet, we decided to do an emergency liver transplant after ensuring that the virus had not invaded his lung,” said Dr Thiagarajan Srinivasan, director, Institute of Liver Diseases at MGM Healthcare.

But the biggest hurdle came in the form of lack of adequate cadaveric donations. In May, the state had just one liver donation, so the only option left with doctors was to look for donors from within the family.
Raghul’s brother was the most suitable donor. “Luckily, he had just recovered from Covid-19 and had good levels of antibodies. Antibodies from the organ and the steroids we used in the surgery also helped us treat the viral infection,” said liver transplant surgeon Dr Karthik Mathivanan.

An emergency meeting was called with experts from across the country. “All experts agreed transplant was the only option,” said Dr Srinivasan. After a 12-hour surgery amid stringent Covid-protocols and biobubble in Covid-proof transport corridors, ICUs and wards during the hospital stay for nearly a fortnight. “We expect him to resume his normal life soon,” he said.

"Only 10 health staff per 10,000 in Telangana: Niti Ayog report",1796,"HYDERABAD: Telangana has only 10 health staff available for every 10,000 people in the state — among the lowest in the country — as per data from the recently released Niti Ayog report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) rankings.
According to it, the state stands at the third spot from the bottom, only ahead of Jharkhand (with four staff for every 10,000) and Nagaland (one for every 10,000) in this crucial parameter of the third SDG goal, which pertains to good health and well-being. The revelation comes at a time when experts are hinting at the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.



While Telangana is positioned as a ‘front-runner’ in its overall achievement of the goal, the poor health staff ratio has pulled the state down to the 17th spot, the report shows. Other south Indian states, in comparison, are much ahead. While the figure in Andhra Pradesh stands at 95 (no of health staff for every 10,000 population), Kerala has 115, Karnataka has 70 Tamil Nadu has 65.

Professor Subodh Kathamuthan, centre director for health management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), attributes this to Telangana’s excessive focus on tertiary care management over the past decade. “This has helped the state in tackling the Covid-19 situation in urban pockets. But along with setting up institutes, it is extremely important to manage staff availability at the primary health care level too so that crises in rural areas can be handled effectively.”
The other parameters under the third SDG include maternal mortality ratio, under 5 mortality rate (children between 9 and 11 months), HIV incidence per 1,000 uninfected population, death rate due to road accidents, institutional deliveries among others.

India PE investments touch record $62 billion in 2020: Bain,2213,"BENGALURU: Private equity firms invested $62 billion in Indian companies last year, the highest in a decade, as per Bain’s India Private Equity Report 2021. A large chunk of it, $26.5 billion, came from the Jio Platform and Reliance Retail deals. Excluding those mega deals, total PE investments was down 20% compared to 2019, as the volume of large deals dipped 25%.
Although overall investment activity was muted between March and May last year due to the lockdown, investor confidence recovered strongly in the second half of the year, touching pre-Covid levels with late-stage and buyout deals witnessing increased traction. The pandemic also led to a shift in the type of deals, with investors focusing on alternate investment strategies such as distressed opportunistic sales and qualified institutional placements.

“Despite Covid-19, we have seen a few investment themes continue from prior years. Strong deal volume flow continued with a 5% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Growth equity momentum held steady with $10 billion in investments, more than in all previous years and nearly at par with 2019,” said Sriwatsan Krishnan, partner and leader in Bain India’s PE practice.
Healthcare, consumer technology, and manufacturing were the main growth drivers, while IT/ITeS remained steady. Consumer tech investments were driven by growth in digital channels and increased user adoption of on-demand, athome cross-tech services. This led to a deal surge in edtech, fintech, verticalised ecommerce, and foodtech, with big-ticket investments in Byju’s, Zomato, and First-Cry. Healthcare reported the highest YoY growth at 60%.

PE firms exiting their investments were also high though exit values came down by 30%. Exit activity was muted in the second and third quarter but came back in the last helped by a strong public market. “2020 saw an unprecedented rise in multiples driven by high-return generating consumer tech and BFSI exits. We expect continued exit momentum over the next one to two years as portfolios of leading PE investors mature and multiple IPOs planned for the next 12 to 18 months are launched,” the report added.

Kerala’s healthcare workers battle virus & violence,2967,"KOCHI: Already hit by trauma and exhaustion, the Covid warriors in Kerala are now under attack.
Since the second wave of the pandemic began in March 2021, seven cases of assault and abuse on healthcare workers (HCWs) have been reported in the state.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

Two incidents each were reported in Thrissur and Alappuzha districts and one each from Kozhikode, Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram. In all cases, though police registered FIR, the accused – bystanders, patients, or their relatives -- are yet to be arrested.
The victims -- government doctors, both women and men, irrespective of their seniority, were alleged of improper treatment leading to complications or death. Some were also attacked for reprimanding the accused for failing to adhere to Covid protocols.

Upset by the unabated attacks, government doctors under Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) and Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association (KGMCTA) have written to the chief minister, health minister and DGP. The KGMOA's letter states that the police have been ""much hesitant to pursue legal proceedings against the culprits .... In most occasions, the modus operandi of police has been to avoid legal proceedings including arrest until the judgment of anticipatory bail is passed"". ""These attacks and subsequent inaction on the part of the authorities are sending a wrong message in the society. This is happening at a time when the HCWs despite being exhausted are working hard to protect lives during the pandemic. Now everyone’s morale is down,"" said Dr TN Suresh, general secretary, KGMOA.
According to Dr Binoy S, state president of Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association (KGMCTA), the doctors are giving the best possible treatment, but ""people need to understand that death is sometimes inevitable.""
""With all focus on Covid treatment in government hospitals, non-Covid treatment has been compromised a little. But it is not fair on people’s part to vent out their frustration on HCWs. We are also human,"" said Dr Binoy.
During the first wave of the pandemic last year, the Central government had brought an ordinance under which any person who attacks a health worker who is treating Covid-19 cases can be jailed for a maximum of seven years.
Under the new law, an attack on health workers is a cognizable and non-bailable offense. However, nothing has changed for the doctors in the field as incidents from the second Covid wave suggest.
“What is more painful is that neither the authorities nor political parties are condemning these attacks on HCWs or taking appropriate action against the culprit,"" said Dr V G Pradeep Kumar, former president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kerala.
""The Hospital Protection Act needs to be amended to register FIR within 24 hours of incident and hospitals should be made special protection zones to save our already exhausted HCWs.""

The deceased, identified as Dr Mahendra Pal, was posted at a Covid hospital in Moradabad and succumbed to the virus on September 2. Moradabad chief medical officer had forwarded a compensation application, but the insurance company rejected it, stating that he had turned Covid negative before his death. His family members had been fighting for 10 months for compensation. Both the state and the Central government had promised to give monetary support to the kin of healthcare workers who lost their lives due to Covid.
Dr Pal is survived by his 37-year-old wife Anita Rani and three children, the eldest being seven-year-old.

“Life has been difficult without my husband. He was the only earning member. After his death I stayed at my inlaws’ house in Moradabad and then shifted to my father’s house in Budaun. I had to stay at my brother’s place for some time as I did not have any house of my own,” said Anita.
The young widow, who has done BEd course and a diploma in computers, is currently a housewife, tending to children from the marriage of nine years. “She hopes to get a job in the NHM department on compensatory grounds as her late husband, too, had worked there,” said her father Jagan Singh.
President, National Child Health Programme Employees Union, Dr Anand Singh said, “It was a long fight. But finally the needy family got the compensation. We hope the government will release compensation for other healthcare workers too.”

PIL invokes Mental Healthcare Act in jab policy; Maharashtra says oxygen ferrying price capped in another PIL,2513,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the state and the Centre to respond to a Public interest litigation (PIL) espousing the cause of a policy for vaccination of the mentally ill persons under provisions of Mental Healthcare Act.
The PIL by T J Bhanu, argued by counsel Sarosh Bharucha, sought to ensure a special ease of convenience and access to vaccination for those who may not be able to make their own decision, like the homeless and the mentally challenged. The sole concern expressed was over absence of a policy for such persons who have no ability to take an informed decision, said the HC order passed by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni.

Bharucha said the Standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Central government on national Covid Vaccination drive is silent on this aspect.
The state’s lawyer Geeta Shashtri said it's reply was ready and that a May 27 advisory issued by the Department of Health and family welfare addressed the concern in the PIL. The HC said, “Having read the advisory dated 27thMay 2021, we have our doubts as to whether the same covers vaccination of an individual who is mentally ill and has to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.’’ It thus adjourned the hearing to June 22 giving time to the additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre and additional government pleader Shahstri to return with better instructions from the governments on the issue.

Meanwhile, in a series of other PIL over other aspects of vaccination, the HC in one asked what steps were taken to create awareness among the rural folk on the importance of vaccination.
In another PIL by a city advocate Nishant Vyas, the HC after hearing his counsel Vishal Kanade on the absence of a price cap on transportation cost of oxygen, dispose it after seeing a decision by the State’s ‘empowered high-level committee’ of May 12, that fixed transport rates for liquid medical oxygen. The HC disposed of the PIL by directing the state to issue necessary notification within a week in compliance with the law
In yet another PIL on ensuring less crowding and better information of availability of vaccines on date of appointment via the Cowin app, HC took suggestions tendered by advocate Jamsheed Master on record and asked State to consider which of them are workable and to adopt them, while adjourning the matter to June 16.

While most family members above 45 years have got the jab, those belonging to the 18-44 age group are not on the priority list of the government and need to pay to get vaccinated.
“When a HCW goes back home from the hospital there is a chance of them carrying the virus, putting the family members at risk.

NGO to join hands with Andhra Pradesh government to construct 10-bed ICUs in rural PHCs,2570,"AMARAVATI: In a move that could be a game-changer in handling the Covid-19 third wave in the state, the government has set its eyes on construction of small ICU units in Primary Health Centres (PHCs). The state government had roped in a non-profit healthcare infrastructure NGO, Nirmaan to set up permanent '10-bed-ICU units’ in Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in rural areas in the state.
Taking the chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s commitment towards providing inclusive, equitable and quality healthcare to all, especially the poor, with a serious consideration, state government’s special representative in North America, Rathnakar R Pandugayala roped in Nirmaan to take up the ICU beds project in the state. Nirmaan has readily conceded to Rathnakar’s request to join hands with the state government in strengthening the healthcare infrastructure in rural areas.

The Nirmaan will construct the 10-Bed ICUs in as many government hospitals as possible, particularly Primary Health Centres (PHCs). The concept of small ICU units is to provide breather to the teaching hospitals in handling the anticipated Covid-19 third wave by greatly reducing patient rush to the towns and cities. The big hospitals including teaching hospitals in the district head quarter cities and private hospitals were unable to handle the heavy turnout of patients during the Covid-19 second wave as oxygen beds and ICU facilities were not available in the village level PHCs.
“Head of the operations of Nirmaan, Srikanth Nathamuni and founder partner of Kohsla Ventures, Vinod Khosla, are the brains behind this initiative,” said Rathnakar. Eluru MP Kotagiri Sridhar, Covid-19 command control centre nodal officer Arja Srikanth are also playing key role in roping in some local donors to expand the operations of Nirmaan in the state.

Each of these designated ICU units will be named after the donor after taking the consent of the state government. “We have already received commitments for construction of 22 units (10-bed ICUs) in different locations. We are aiming to complete 100 units shortly,” Rathnakar told TOI.
He said that they have been negotiating with some of the NRIs and also local philanthropists to extend their support to develop the small ICU units in rural areas. He said that providing best healthcare infrastructure right in the villages would be the easiest way to beat the Covid-19. He said that the state government would appoint staff along with doctors to handle the ICU units in PHCs. He said that 10-bed ICUs would be permanent features in the rural PHCs.

Healthcare company owner and pharma lab employee held in inter-state fake Favipravir racket,2976,"MUMBAI: The owner of a Himachal Pradesh-based “healthcare company” and the employee of a pharma lab in Meerut have been arrested for links to an inter-state ring selling spurious Favipravir tablets.
The drug has been widely used for Covid-19 treatment in the country. The case has sparked concern among activists on spurious drugs that have reached patients. The drugs are believed to have been sold in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Acting on a tip-off, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) had raided three wholesale drug dealers, two of them in the suburbs of Kandivali East and Goregaon East. Stocks of Favimax 400 and 200 (Favipravir tablets) and hydroxychloroquine tablets collectively worth Rs 1.5 crore were seized. Cartons in which the tablets were packed named the manufacturer as Max Relief Healthcare from Solan in HP.

TIMES VIEW

A scam linked to the sale of spurious drugs on a large scale is always alarming. In the midst of a pandemic, the human cost of such criminal enterprises can be staggering. Constant checks must be carried out by the FDA and police to tackle this menace as numerous patients can be at risk. Government must do its bit and plug the gaps in staffing at senior levels in the FDA, which TOI has written about in the past.



The FDA then dashed an email to the drugs controller in HP who clarified that no such company existed. “A further inquiry revealed that Max Relief Healthcare’s Noida establishment was selling drugs to wholesalers in the state when it did not have a licence to do so. All states were immediately alerted to stop using this drug,” an FDA officer said.
On May 30, the Max Relief owner, Sudip Mukherjee, appeared before the FDA but carried no documents linked to production and sale of drugs. “He could not provide any information about drug production and sale licences either. At first glance, the photocopy of a licence that he produced appeared fake. He was handed over to the Samta Nagar police station where an FIR was registered the same day and Mukherjee was arrested,” said the FDA officer. Another FIR was registered at Vanrai police station in Goregaon East.
Inquiries took a police team to Meerut in UP where they zeroed in on Sandeep Mishra, an employee of a pharma lab, who was allegedly manufacturing spurious Favipravir tablets, and his associate who was helping to pack them. “A sample was tested and they were confirmed to be fake,” said senior inspector Anand Hake, Samta Nagar police. Mishra and Mukherjee have been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. More arrests are likely.
Earlier this month, Gujarat FDA had seized fake Favipravir tablets that had even been listed on an online pharmacy store and were being sold for Rs 1,096 per strip. The fake drug was found to be nothing but starch after tests were conducted. A number of local stores in three Gujarat cities were selling the tablets.

India may raise vaccine spending to $6 billion this fiscal year: Report,1587,"NEW DELHI: India may raise spending on Covid-19 shots by over a quarter this fiscal year to up to Rs 45,000 crore ($6.18 billion) from its budgeted amount, two government sources told Reuters after the prime minister offered free doses to all adults.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an address to the nation on Monday that the government would bear the cost of vaccinating all adults from June 21. His previous policy of getting individual states to pay for immunisations for those aged under 45 years was widely criticised.

The sources, who did not want to be named as they were not authorised to speak with the media, said the government would spend up to Rs 45,000 crore on Covid-19 vaccines this fiscal year, which started on April 1. The previously budgeted amount was Rs 35,000 crore.
One of the sources said part of the increase could be due to higher-than-previous costs for domestically manufactured shots. He did not elaborate. India's finance ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The country is currently using the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech. Russia's Sputnik V will be commercially launched in the country in the middle of the month.
Modi's policy shift underscored a drive to rein in a Covid-19 pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands in India and led to the world's second-highest tally of infections.
It followed weeks of criticism of a bungled vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5% of India's estimated adult population of 950 million.

"HDFC to set up O2 plants, Covid beds",1658,"TNN
Mumbai: HDFC has committed an initial amount of Rs 40 crore from its corporate social responsibility budget to support the battle against Covid and has promised to increase this commitment over the next two quarters, based on need. Last year, the corporation had contributed Rs 80 crore toward Covid relief.

The Covid initiatives are being undertaken through its philanthropic arm, the H T Parekh Foundation. HDFC has partnered with government and charitable hospitals for healthcare initiatives to support long-term health infrastructure. These initiatives include direct procurement and distribution of 80 high-quality ICU ventilators in Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
The corporation has undertaken to set up 10 oxygen plants to meet the medical oxygen demands of hospitals in a sustainable manner in six states. In addition, it will expand the existing hospital bed capacity for at least five Covid extension hospitals with a 50-100 incremental bed capacity. It is providing meals to 15,000 healthcare workers across New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Kolkata and will increase the number to 25,000 workers over the next few months.

Besides this, HDFC is responding to on-ground, local needs by providing essential medical equipment, ambulances, and medical consumables in hard-to-reach geographies in the northeast and rural districts. “The severity of the second wave and the resultant health crisis is different this time around. It is critical that we strike a balance to address immediate needs for healthcare and longer-term needs for supporting livelihoods and building a more resilient health infrastructure in the country.”

Goa’s largest healthcare institute has no intensivist to take care of critical patients,2284,"PANAJI: Even as Goa Medical College was forced to expand its ICU facilities as Covid-19 cases multiplied in April, the state’s largest healthcare establishment doesn’t have a single intensivist. Its ICU beds are currently managed by the stretched anaesthesia department, and the ICU at the super-specialty block is being guided by a cardiac anaesthetist from the cardiology department.
GMC’s attempts to hire an intensivist have been futile so far. The last time this post was advertised was during the first wave last year.

Dean Dr S M Bandekar said that the salary demands of intensivists are high, which they can't meet. A consultant joining any super-specialty department at GMC is paid Rs 3 lakh per month at an entry-level.
“We are willing to hire an intensivist, but nobody wants to join us for salary reasons. Dr Sunil Sagar, under whose leadership the ICU in the super-speciality block has been set up this month, is as good as an intensivist. He is one of the best we have. He has a DM in anaesthesia,” Bandekar said.

The role of an intensivist is critical in ICUs, as this specialist has knowledge of how various treatments affect the organs of a patient, and accordingly regulates fluid intake by precisely considering other parameters. Bandekar added that while GMC doesn’t have an intensivist per see, he said its ICU staff is well-trained.
The ICU beds at GMC and the South Goa district hospital are being managed by around 17 anaestheia staffers and a dozen post-grad students and doctors serving bond. Besides 150-plus Covid ICU beds, GMC also has 35 non-covid ICU beds.
A senior doctor said that while GMC’s ICU staff is trained, by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that it’s adequate. “It is tough going for GMC with so little staff, especially when the hospital has been handling loads of critical cases. However, in Goa, we don’t have intensivists,” the doctor said.
It is not just government hospitals but even private ones — except 2-3 major ones — are currently without intensivists.
A while ago, GMC had tried to get a doctor serving bond trained as an intensivist. She completed a year’s training in ICU post her MD in anaesthesia. “For a brief period, we had an intensivist, but she went back to her home state after marriage,” said Bandekar.

"CM Tirath Singh Rawat inspects government health facilities in Haridwar, says ‘all fine’",1348,"HARIDWAR: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Sunday inspected the Baba Burfani and Mela Covid healthcare centres in Haridwar and also conducted an inspection of health facilities in Rudrapur including the ESIC Hospital.
After the inspection in Haridwar, the CM attended a presentation on the present Covid situation in the district. “The district has done tremendous work to control the second wave. As a state, we have won this battle as the capacity of oxygen and ventilator beds has been increased. Testing has also been increased and health facilities in rural areas enhanced before the third wave,” the CM said.

This is a modal window.

However, local residents and activists said that the facilities on the ground are not adequate.
“No government hospital has been declared a Covid-dedicated facility for critical patients in the district so far. The government did arrange for ventilators ahead of the Kumbh mela but no staff was recruited to operate them, so the machines were moved to private hospitals,” RM Dobhal, a local social activist, alleged.

He added that the district does not have a single RT-PCR testing lab. “How were 15 lakh tests conducted then? Either the CM is ignoring the situation on ground or is being misguided by officials into thinking it’s all fine,”Dobhal said.

"Uttrakhand gets Rs 900 crore for NHM projects, highest grant of all time",1837,"DEHRADUN: With a focus on reducing maternal and infant mortality rates in Uttarakhand, the Centre has released Rs 894 crore for National Health Mission (NHM) projects in the state — the highest it has ever received. Besides hiring more staff and strengthening infrastructure, the Centre plans on introducing transportation services between hospitals and homes for mothers and children, setting up five blood storage units and gathering more data.
“After health checkups of school children, they can be referred to hospitals. For this, referral transport has been approved by the Centre. The state will be providing this transport facility to mother and child after delivery as well,” said an NHM official.

To keep an eye on maternal health in the state, the government will incentivise those who share data. “This year, the state government will be able to start a scheme for giving a Rs 1,000-incentive to the first person who shares information about maternal deaths at the community level,” the NHM official said.
The state will appoint 400 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and 158 staff nurses this year. It will also set up 54 delivery points and 29 first referral points for safe delivery. The operation and maintenance of 132 new ambulances under 108 emergency services has been provided for.

Also in the pipeline are five blood storage units and five new dialysis centres — at Bageshwar, Chamoli, Champawat, Tehri and Uttarkashi. A peritoneal dialysis centre (peritoneal dialysis does not require an artificial kidney machine) will also be set up at Doon Medical College. Two cardiac care units will come up — in Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi — and free diagnostic services will be offered at public health institutions, covering 56 tests at district hospitals and sub district hospitals, and 28 tests at community health centres.

The report indicates that Telangana has 5,552 authorised healthcare facilities and 649 unauthorised healthcare facilities which generate 20,472 kg of biomedical waste per day. Of this, 4,000 kg per day accounts for Covid-19 biomedical waste.
In AP, there are 7,092 authorised healthcare facilities and 485 unauthorised healthcare facilities that generate 15,051 kg per day of biomedical waste of which13,110 kg is Covid-19 related waste. “Although it is a small proportion of the total waste generated (around one per cent), it needs special handling due to its highly toxic contents that can pose a severe threat to human health,” read the report.

While both states effectively treat and dispose of 100 per cent of its biomedical waste, states such as Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan have been able to treat and dispose of less than 50 per cent of its biomedical waste.

"Autos get nod to ferry vaccine recipients to centres, healthcare workers to hosps",1958,"Kolkata: At a time when restrictions have been imposed on public transport to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, the traffic police have allowed auto operators to ferry hospital staff members from their homes to their workplaces and vaccine recipients to the inoculation centres. But cops have sent out a warning: anyone misusing the relaxation and auto drivers plying for regular commute will be penalised. There have been reports of autos resuming operations in some parts of the city.
An officer said while bus drivers and conductors had returned to their homes in the districts, auto drivers were still in Kolkata. “If they get genuine calls from healthcare workers to drop them off to their hospitals and workplaces, we will be considerate. They can also take patients to hospitals in emergencies or vaccine recipients to the centres as public transport is unavailable. But if they are seen plying on scheduled routes, we will seize the vehicles,” he said.

Police said James Long Sarani traffic guard and Jorabagan traffic guard on Friday seized a few autos plying at Taratala crossing and on B K Pal Avenue. Autos operating in Tangra-Topsia and Ultadanga have been reported. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha reiterated autos had not been permitted to ply regular routes. “We have asked our men to act against anyone violating the restrictions without valid reason,” he said.
Auto operators said the enhanced restrictions had hit their business, especially when they were already dealing with increased gas prices and the closure of offices, schools and colleges.

Police are considering a change in their inspection schedule at check-posts following the easing of time restrictions on retail shops from June 1. “We might put more importance on night nakas as there has been no concession in that. We will also begin random checking at nakas instead of checking every motorist as this is leading to jams. We might also choose areas,” said an officer.

Chennai hospital performs swap liver transplant,1926,"CHENNAI: As cases began to pile up during the second Covid wave in early April, hopes came crashing for a 48-year-old lawyer, Ramesh Babu, who was in urgent need of a liver. Doctors in MGM Healthcare told him that his wife’s organ could not be used for him as their blood groups did not match. Almost parallelly, a 57-year-old businessman from Gummidipundi, Rajhashekar was also told that his son’s liver was too small for him.
Both the lawyer and businessman would have been waitlisted for a cadaveric organ in the state registry, Transtan, had luck not smiled at them. The medical team processing the reports found that a part of the liver from lawyer’s wife Nancy Babu would be adequate for the businessman. His son R Aditya was a universal donor (blood group 0+).

The Institute of Liver Transplant pushed the papers for swap liver transplants in Tamil Nadu under the Chief Minister Health Insurance Scheme. The state government agreed, and the hospital made a detailed plan for two simultaneous transplants and carried out the surgery on April 4.
“We have to run between four theatres – two donors and two recipients,” said liver transplant surgeon Dr Karthik Mathivanan.

“It took nearly 10 hours for each transplant, but we had two teams including transplant surgeons, anesthetists, transplant critical care experts and technicians,” he said.
The hospital had created a bio-bubble for the procedure, says senior transplant surgeon Dr Thiagarajan Srinivasan. “All team members were vaccinated. Staff, patients, donors and their family members underwent RT-PCR tests at frequent intervals before surgery. Any person who exited the bio-bubble had to get themselves tested again and obtain a negative report to re-enter the bubble,” he said. If the swap hadn’t worked the hospital would have put the patients on waiting list for cadaver donation. “This would have delayed the transplant and put patients at risk,” he said.

UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid shot for 12- to 15-year-olds,1354,"LONDON: Britain's medicines regulator said on Friday it had approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for use on 12- to 15-year-olds, following similar clearances in the US and the EU.
The regulator said it would now be up to the country's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to decide whether to go ahead and inoculate this age group as part of Britain's vaccination roll-out plan.

Children aged 12-15 are already receiving the Pfizer shot in the United States, while France and Germany are planning to start offering it to that age group this month.
Britain's Health and Social Care department said it would provide an update once the JCVI had made its decision.

The chief executive of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency June Raine said in a statement that her agency had carefully reviewed the clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years old.
""(We) have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk,"" she said.
However, giving vaccines to younger people in affluent countries while many parts of the world await doses for older and more vulnerable people has raised concerns. The World Health Organisation has urged rich countries to give shots to the COVAX scheme instead.

Gurugram: ‘Low infection rate and no deaths among fully vaccinated HCWs’,4003,"GURUGRAM: Four hospitals in the city saw a low infection rate and no deaths among fully vaccinated health care workers in a two-month period from March to May that coincided with the ferocious second wave of Covid that ravaged Delhi-NCR, according to data they have shared with TOI. Collectively, the data covers 9,383 health care workers.
In all four hospitals – Medanta, Park, Narayana and the state-run Civil Hospital – the share of fully vaccinated healthcare workers with ‘breakthrough’ Covid infections despite the immunity shield was in the 6-7% range. Most of them were asymptomatic or had “mild to moderate” symptoms and very few needed ICU care, hospital officials said. The hospitals began looking at infections after 14 days of the second dose. At Medanta, the data is for the period between March 27 and May 21, at Civil from March 23 to May 19, at Park from March 26 to May 23 and at Narayana from March 28 to May 18.

Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram, said, “No deaths among health care workers were reported after full vaccination. If a person is infected with Covid after 14 days have passed since the second dose of vaccine, it is termed a ‘breakthrough’ infection. In such cases, mortality is negligible. Thus, vaccination is important for all to curb the spread of the infection.”
Medanta’s data shows out of its 4,000 fully vaccinated health care workers, 250 were infected. Of them, eight had moderate symptoms and two had to be admitted in ICU. “Most of our health care workers had mild symptoms and recovered soon. This shows that vaccination provides protection against Covid,” said Dr Sushila Katariya, director and head of internal medicine at Medanta.

Civil Hospital saw ‘breakthrough’ infections in 89 of its healthcare workers, among the 1,425 in inoculated. Three of them got a severe infection and had to be hospitalised. Fifteen had moderate symptoms. “90% were asymptomatic. Symptoms of infected healthcare workers were sore throat, body ache, muscle pain and gastrointestinal pain,” said CMO Yadav.
At the Park group of hospitals, out of the 3,500 health care staff they fully vaccinated, 206 tested positive but none needed to be hospitalised, officials said. Park CEO Dr PN Kakar said, “Vaccines were never labelled as 100% successful. Health care workers went ahead with it as a moral responsibility and duty. End of the day, they all benefited as, though-post vaccination several doctors got infected and some even lost their lives, (those were) not in our hospital but other places.”
At Narayana, 458 healthcare workers had completed both doses and 34 of them got infected. Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of emergency and medical services at the hospital, told TOI, “Health care workers are committed to their service 24 hours even in these unprecedented times. On our hospital premises, the total number of healthcare workers is 597, of whom 458 are fully vaccinated. Although 34 health care workers got Covid while treating patients, they came back to their jobs after recovery. Around 15-20% got post-vaccination symptoms after the first dose, and only 2-3% got symptoms after the second dose. No deaths were recorded. Vaccination is necessary in the fight against this pandemic.”
Among private hospitals, Max Healthcare had last month released data on infections among its employees after both vaccine doses. The infection rate was similar. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, said, “Since the vaccination drive commenced on January 16 for healthcare workers, close to 14,000 employees across our network hospitals received both doses. Of this set, 6% got the Covid infection and 90% of those infected were mild cases. Only 10% required hospitalisation. All of them recovered well except one elderly clinician who was admitted in ICU but unfortunately succumbed to the disease. This proves that the vaccine is effective and significantly reduces infection rates as well as severity of the disease.”

"West Bengal sets up panel, gets ready to upgrade paediatric Covid infrastructure",3143,"KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Wednesday set up an experts’ committee with the aim of preparing itself for the eventuality that kids may be the most affected during the third wave of the pandemic, even as the health department started the process of revamping the state’s paediatric Covid infrastructure.
The department is very likely to set up a paediatric Covid-care unit with around 1,000 beds, 20% of it devoted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Medical College and Hospital (MCH). The decision came after a high-level meeting at Swasthya Bhavan on Wednesday, during which senior officials took feedback from the committee on what kind of preparedness should be taken up.

“Since MCH has the experience of treating paediatric Covid patients right from the first wave, we are planning to have a big unit for treating children there in case a third wave hits,” said a source. “We need to be fully prepared so that we can counter the wave better.”
Augmenting paediatric Covid infrastructure includes being prepared on several fronts: keeping beds ready, procuring ventilators and other medical equipment, training human resources like doctors and nurses on the different needs of infected children. All these aspects were discussed during the meeting, the source said. The exert committee also pointed out deficiencies and shortages we might face in case more children are affected in the third wave. “Their inputs will be seriously considered so that we are not caught offguard,” he added.

MCH now has 25 paediatric Covid beds. Some other hospitals, like ICH (Institute of Child Health) has also started their Covid units, as have private hospitals like Apollo Gleneagles and Fortis Hospital.
“Though there is no robust scientific data on the third wave, the hypothesis of its possibility is based on what several Western countries are experiencing,” said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri, who’s an associate professor at ICH. “That we saw a larger number of unvaccinated younger population getting infected in the second wave leads us to expect that the paediatric population could be the target in the next wave. That is why we need to revamp paediatric facilities.”
Noticing the rise in the number of symptomatic patients during the second wave last month, an experts’ committee (not the one set up on Wednesday) had prepared a Covid treatment protocol for children.
Healthcare experts apprehend the third wave, if it happens, during the months of winter festivity. Paediatrician Pallab Chatterjee of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital said PICU beds for patients of other ailments, too, were scarce in peripheral hospitals; even in the city, there are not enough. He said preparedness was key in handling the third wave.
“One silver lining is that most children don’t get severe infection. In kids, the ACE2 receptor, through which the spike protein of the virus goes into the body, is not well developed in the respiratory tract. Hence, the virus attacks children mostly in the gastrointestinal tract, causing issues like diarrhoea and dehydration. It might be a lot easier to treat them than adults,” said Chattejee.

Exhaustion and fear for India's frontline doctors in Covid battle,3564,"NEW DELHI: Low pay, 24-hour shifts and severe shortages of staff and protective gear have left many doctors on the frontlines of India's brutal pandemic surge near breaking point and fearful for their lives.
Coronavirus infections have killed at least 165,000 people in the vast South Asian nation -- home to some of the world's most densely populated cities -- since the start of April.

Although India's latest Covid-19 surge has eased recently, around 3,000 people are still dying every day and the chronically underfunded health care system remains under severe pressure.
""We are overworked, stressed and very frightened,"" Radha Jain, a doctor in the capital New Delhi, told AFP.

The Indian Medical Association said more than 1,200 doctors have died of Covid since the start of the pandemic -- including over 500 in the last two months.
Deependra Garg, a doctor working in Delhi's outskirts, knows first-hand how dire the situation has become.
His wife Anubha, 48, a physician herself, fell ill with Covid in April.
They started treatment at home but as her condition worsened, he -- like so many other families -- struggled to get a hospital bed.
He eventually found one almost 200 kilometres (120 miles) from their home. But Anubha -- who was fully vaccinated -- died within two weeks, leaving behind their 12-year-old daughter.
""We are on the frontlines 24/7. We are exposed to a high virus load but we have to continue working against all odds as we have chosen this profession,"" Garg said.
""We do not have a choice.""
The pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses in India's healthcare system, particularly in the ill-equipped state-run hospitals.
As the latest outbreak spread, reports emerged from short-staffed hospitals of patients lying on floors and sharing beds in packed wards, as family members protected with only cotton masks took care of their stricken loved ones.
The government spends less than two percent of GDP on healthcare, one of the lowest rates in the world.
India had just 0.8 doctors per 1,000 people in 2017 -- around the same level as Iraq, according to the World Bank. The two other countries worst-hit by the coronavirus, Brazil and the US, had 2.2 and 2.6 respectively.
A report from before the pandemic by the US-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy estimated that India needed 600,000 more doctors and two million extra nurses to meet its healthcare needs.
Doctor Shekhar Kumar, working with a private hospital in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, said junior staff and final-year medical students sometimes had to work 24-hour shifts.
""Compared to last year, this time patients are needing longer hospital stays which is increasing the burden on the staff,"" Kumar said.
He added that they were further stretched when their colleagues fell ill with the virus.
Doctors said they had been traumatised by being forced to choose which patients to save first as they grappled with insufficient supplies of medicine and oxygen.
Ravikant Singh, the founder of a charity group helping to set up Covid field hospitals, said he struggled to sleep some nights.
""It's been a life-changing situation for doctors,"" Singh told AFP.
""The worst part was... we could not save many lives because of the lack of oxygen.""
Even after completing their punishing shifts, doctors said they worried about infecting their families at home.
Kumar said he would constantly think about how the virus was ""lurking anywhere and everywhere"".
""If doctors can't save their (own) lives, how will they save the lives of others?"" he said.

RJD chief Lalu Prasad slams Nitish Kumar over ‘poor’ health facilities in Bihar,1831,"PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad is using social media platforms as a tool to attack chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar.
On Tuesday he shared a photo of a referral hospital at Chandrayan in Saharsa, which was built at a cost of Rs 14 crore and inaugurated by him on November 18, 1995, on his Twitter handle. The name plaque installed on the occasion is, however, missing.



Taking cognisance of the matter, Lalu tweeted, “The hospital was set up to provide medical facilities to the people living on both the eastern and the western flanks of the embankment. But it met the same fate as thousands of other such hospitals in the state.”

The photo was initially uploaded by the Saharsa district unit of the RJD, which was later shared by Lalu. The party alleged that the referral hospital at Chandrayan had virtually turned into a “bhoot bungalow”.
The development comes a day after a similar photo related to a hospital at Chakbajitpur under Hilsa assembly segment in Nalanda district was shared by the former CM on his Twitter handle. Lalu blamed Nitish for the closure of the health facility in his native district.


Reacting to Lalu’s tweet, JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, “He (Lalu) has become more active on social media ever since the Jharkhand high court granted him bail on health grounds. Had he improved the health facilities in the state during his tenure, the situation would have been quite different.”
The JD (U) MLC added, “The people are aware of the situation that prevailed in government hospitals during the RJD regime. A rise in the number of footfalls during the NDA rule is a proof of the kind of work that has been done in the field of healthcare in the state.”
Meanwhile, sources close to the first RJD family denied the report of Lalu’s visit to Patna in the near future due to “his health condition”.

Healthcare should be made accessible in villages: Docs,3135,"PATNA: With the state witnessing the worst of human sufferings during the second wave of Covid and black fungus that followed it, the medical fraternity has now called for reshaping of the healthcare facilities from district headquarters to blocks for facing any such challenges in future.
National president-elect of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, said panchayat representatives and mukhiyas, who are familiar with most villagers, would have to play an important role in screening diarrhoea, flu and fungal diseases and report the same to the nearest healthcare facility.

“The government must provide at least two oximeters in every village to be regularly used by trained heath staff under the supervision of panchayat people. It will help monitor oxygen saturation level, the sudden decline of which led to happy hypoxia condition,” he said.
Dr Singh added the second wave of Covid pandemic reminded lawmakers and authorities concerned not to keep the healthcare facilities confined to big urban hospitals, but to extend it down to villages.

“Though there is no evidence of any new disease, there are strong chances of new strains to appear in the days to come,” said Dr B P Singh, head of cardiology at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna.
He said viruses tend to get stronger for their survival by undergoing mutations and becoming more fatal. “Taking a lesson from Covid which demanded reinforcement of medicines and equipment, there is now an urgent need of a micro-level preparation to strengthen the health facilities down to villages. Environmental changes, lifestyle and injudicious use of drugs too could lead to many severe conditions,” he said.
Former superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said lack of selective or specific anti-viral drugs was the main reason for the rise in complications due to viral infections, including Covid. “Most pathogenic microbes are identified and their drugs developed. Their mutation, transmission ability and effect on human organs remain uncertain till leading to diseases,” he said.
Dr Prasad said the Covid spread rejuvenated the health system with rush of oxygen and other medicines and underlined the need for enhancing the strength of medical workers and doctors. “Basic healthcare facilities, trained persons and simple diagnostic appliances to test blood pressure, blood sugar and oxygen saturation should be provided to every village,” he added.
Dr Satyajeet Singh, managing director of Ruban Memorial Hospital, said the preventive and social medicine branch of medical science could play a vital role in creating a healthy environment by making people aware on personal hygiene, proper lifestyle and immunity boosting food habits which could help lower the incidents of dozens of diseases which, if neglected, could prove fatal.
“There always stands possibility of new biological agents like bacteria and virus, sometimes adapted forms of insects, causing disease of intense effects. We have faced cholera, plague and tuberculosis and are now exposed to Covid,” Dr Satyajeet said.

"Need uniform, effective law against healthcare violence: Top medical body to Amit Shah",1280,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Medical Association on Tuesday wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah and urged him to ensure strong and effective action against healthcare violence.
In the letter signed by IMA chief Dr J A Jayalal, the doctors' body said that incidents of healthcare violence have increased over the years and have become widespread.

""While the entire medical fraternity stands with you and is working tirelessly during the pandemic, it is also facing a serious threat from healthcare violence,"" it said.



The IMA mentioned the recent incident in Assam where a doctor was assaulted by the relatives of a Covid patient.
It said that doctors and healthcare staff are finding it difficult to work under the stress of violence.
""The real size of the problem is largely unknown and recent information shows that the current knowledge is only the tip of the iceberg,"" it said.
The IMA pitched for a comprehensive, uniform, and effective law against the healthcare violence.
""We request you to kindly approve an effective and strong act against the healthcare violence. Medical profession being different from the rest of the professions, it becomes necessary to have a strong act against violence specifically for the healthcare professionals and workers,"" it said.

Easing restrictions for Sundargarh with high active caseload raises eyebrows,2435,"BHUBANESWAR: The state government's special relaxation for Sundargarh in the extended lockdown has surprised health experts.
While extending the ongoing lockdown from June 1 until June 17, the state government on Sunday made some exceptions for three districts, the other two being Nuapada and Gajapati. Most of the shops in the three districts can remain open from 7am to 1pm from Mondays to Fridays. In the rest of the state, only shops dealing in essential items, food, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs and milk can open during the lockdown. Their timings have been restricted to four hours from 7am to 11am.

Healthcare experts said it was justifiable to ease the curbs for Nuapada and Gajapati, which have a low active caseload of around 500 each, a weekly average test positivity rate (TPR) of below 10% and both the districts have been consistently reporting very few new infections. However, the relaxations given to Sundargarh have baffled many because this western Odisha district has 4,917 active cases, which is the fourth highest after Khurda (11,470), Cuttack (7,764) and Angul (4,964). Sundargarh's TPR for the past one week from May 23 to May 30 has been above 11%. The number of new infections in the district per day is around 500 or more. Sundargarh has reported 267 Covid deaths, the third highest after Khurda (468) and Ganjam (283).
Defending the government's decision, health minister Naba Kishore Das said, ""It has a decentralised approach. The decision has been taken on the basis of the feedback from the district administrations.""

However, health experts were not convinced with the government's logic. ""I don't understand the rationale behind giving relaxations to Sundargarh. The reasons for Nuapada and Gajapati can be understood, but not Sundargarh,"" Ashok Mahapatra, former director of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, who is currently the vice-chancellor of SOA University, said.
R K Purohit, a doctor based in Bargarh, too, said, ""The government move defies logic. I don't see any scientific reason behind giving Sundargarh such a lot of leeway when the situation is still unwarranted.""
Assuaging their apprehensions, director (public health) Niranjan Mishra said, ""High positivity rate is not the only consideration behind giving relaxation to any district. The government considers the situation in totality, taking all factors into account.""

Uttar Pradesh: Health workers pay homage to dead peers,950,"LUCKNOW: Healthcare workers across the state observed two-minute silence on Monday afternoon and offered tributes to their colleagues who have lost their lives to Covid-19 since 2020.
They lighted candles in front of banners bearing photographs of all those who died of Covid.

“People in hospitals or offices stood in silence as a tribute to our colleagues. Those at home lit a candle there. We have requested the government again that compensation as promised to these families be paid and all their other dues such as pension also facilitated at the earliest,” said vice-president of State Employees’ Joint Council Suneel Yadav.
The tribute was held in coordination with Indian Public Service Employees’ Federation, State Employees’ Joint Council, Pharmacists’ Federation, State Nurses’ Association and others. NHM Employees’ Association will hold a similar memorial service for over 30 colleagues who died of Covid-19 since March 2020 on June 2.

"Uttar Pradesh: Health staff dead, kin await Rs 50 lakh grant",3302,"LUCKNOW: Government school teacher Preeti lost her husband Sri Saran Srivastava (52), chief pharmacist at the Chinhat community health centre, to Covid-19 on January 4 this year. The tragedy was not only devastating but led to the family income dropping by 60%. Their son could not take admission to the US-based university he got selected for.
Now, the single mother also has a mounting home loan, but her applications for compensation have not received any concrete answers so far.

Many healthcare worker families like Preeti’s, which have lost their bread winners to Covid-19, complain that they are struggling to get the promised Rs 50 lakh insurance under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package for corona warriors. Preeti claimed that their own house is still under construction and authorities have asked them to vacate the accommodation allotted to her husband.
“Forget about compensation, even pension has not started despite several reminders. Besides loan EMIs, paying children’s education fees has become difficult. We have shelved the plan to send our son for medical education to the US,” she added.

According to healthcare workers’ associations, Covid-19 has snuffed out lives of 149 healthcare workers so far: these are 75 doctors, 40 NHM-outsourced employees, 20 permanent staff including nurses, and 14 pharmacists. Among these, eight doctors, six NHM workers and six nurses are from Lucknow.
Director general medical health Dr DS Negi said, “The names of 48 healthcare workers who died of Covid-19 have been sent to the central government for Rs 50 lakh compensation. Of these, nine have got it, five applications were rejected and others are pending.
UP Employees’ Joint Council vice-president Suneel Yadav claimed that some applications were rejected because the healthcare worker was not deployed in a Covid hospital.
“The infection risk is equal in all hospitals because Covid cases came for treatment everywhere, hence all victims who got infected at workplaces must be compensated,” he said.
President of National Child Health Programme Employee Union Dr Anand Singh, said Dr Mahendra Pal, posted at a Covid hospital in Moradabad, died on September 2, 2020. The Moradabad CMO had forwarded the compensation application, but the insurance company rejected it saying he had turned Covid negative by the time of death.”
KGMU staff nurse Asha Dhusia died of Covid-19 on September 21.
Her son Shubham said, “My mother got infected during duty in the triage area. Since then, we have been making rounds of offices for compensation and pension with no conclusive answer.”
Lab technician at Balu Adda CHC Ritesh Raj Mishra (28), collected samples for tests without taking any leave from March 2020 to April 2021, till he got infected and died on April 18.
“He was felicitated by the mayor and police for devotion, but we are in the dark about compensation,” said Ritesh’s father Jitendra Mishra.
A paediatrician at a government hospital died last June. Hospital chief Dr Sudha Verma said, “All documents were submitted last year itself, but we don’t know why approval is still pending.”
UP Provincial Medical Services Association general secretary Dr Amit Singh said that authorities should ensure that the victim’s family doesn’t have to run around for compensation or other benefits.

Telangana PHCs given target of 250 daily tests by health department,2251,"HYDERABAD: The state health department has given its highest-ever testing target to primary healthcare centres (PHC) since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. PHCs have now been told to conduct 250 antigen tests daily. It had reached its lowest daily testing at just 40 tests per day recently. While local authorities have been asked to conduct as many tests as they can, this is the first time an official target of 250 daily tests has been set.
If most PHCs in the state manage to achieve the new daily testing target, the state will reach a testing rate of over 1.5 lakh tests per day. Following a recent cabinet meeting over increasing the tests, the state health department had boosted the number of tests from an average of around 60,000 tests per day to almost 90,000 tests per day on average.

According to highly-placed sources within the health department, the new target is aimed at achieving at least one lakh tests per day till the end of June. After that, a discussion on new testing targets will be taken up and a decision will be taken in accordance with the prevailing situation.

Apart from fixing a new daily testing target for PHCs, another major change has been initiated in the pattern of testing. Earlier, people would approach the identified testing centres in PHCs to get tested but now testing will be carried out based on the findings of the fever survey. Those identified as symptomatic during the survey will be divided into small groups and then taken to select locations for their Covid-19 tests. “Each Asha worker and ANM has been given a target of identifying a fixed number of symptomatic persons. They (the symptomatic persons) will be brought to the designated place with assistance from local technicians and their tests will be performed. These tests will fall within the daily target set for PHCs at 250,” informed an official from the state health department.
Speaking to TOI over the increased rate of testing, state public health director Dr Srinivasa Rao said the objective behind the move was to ensure that no one is denied testing in the state. “There is abundant availability of antigen kits in the state,” he said.

Maharashtra ropes in hakims to beat tribals’ vaccine hesitancy,2032,"NAGPUR: Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli and Nagpur district collectors are adopting innovative measures to counter vaccine hesitancy among the tribal population, who have been misled by messages in social media claiming deaths and impotency due to vaccination against Covid-19.
Gadchiroli collector Dipak Singla and his Nagpur counterpart Ravindra Thakare are asking local village ‘doctors’ like hakims or bhoomkals and pujaris or priests to first take the jab themselves and then encourage the villagers to do the same. The district administrations are also approaching the peoples’ representatives to promote the vaccination drive.

The district administrations have also started awareness campaigns in local languages, including the tribal ones like Gondi and Madia, spoken in eastern Vidarbha’s Maoist-affected Gadchiroli. Healthcare teams are also visiting remote places to get villagers vaccinated in the Maoist hotbed of Abhujamadh along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border.
Singla said that a 21-point awareness campaign has been started to first target the hamlets where there is least resistance. The campaign will then move on to villages that are completely refusing vaccination. “We are roping in local doctors, who provide the first line of treatment to the villagers. Once these local doctors are vaccinated, they can motivate the villagers,” said Singla.

He said help will also be taken from opinion-makers like tribal activist Devaji Tofa and other well-known personalities to boost vaccination.
Gadchiroli’s district health officer Dr Shashikant Shambarkar said his team first vaccinated the pujari at a small hamlet in Chamorshi taluka and another at Dhanora. The villagers followed them.
Thakare, who feels the anticipated third wave may hit the villagers more than the urban population, is keen to intensify the vaccination drive in rural parts, especially in the tribal belt of Nagpur district. “We want to capitalize on the trust the local population has in hakims and others who use herbs for treatment,” he said.

New ultrasound tool launched for quick Covid scan,1432,"Kolkata: While the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up several challenges to health workers catering to the patients , GE Healthcare has launched ultrasound systems that will help them in quick and easy detection of one’s condition as well as reduce the risk like exposure to the virus during the screening and treatment of patients with novel coronavirus in hospitals.
During the second wave of the pandemic, there is a strong need for precise and accurate treatment of patients. Clinicians need to have accurate assessment of a patient’s heart and lung, but this might put them at a risk of contracting the virus. “Keeping that in mind, we introduced the venue family – a group of three ultrasound products that meet all the key needs of clinicians and are equipped with AI features for better treatment of Covid patients,” Ashit Shah, head of ultrasound, GE Healthcare, South Asia, told TOI.

The company developed their own platform to virtually launch the product simultaneously in South Asia, including Kolkata and Bengal markets, on May 15 and 16.
Asked whether the utility of the tool is restricted to Covid treatment only, Shah explained that after the pandemic gets over, it can be used for critical care, OT, neonatology, musculoskeletal management and pain management among other medical areas. “Clinicians are continuously seeking diagnostic equipment that can help them accurately diagnose and treat patients,” Shah said.

"With Rs 45k cr kitty, govt extends loan guarantee scheme to airlines",2527,"Mumbai: The government on Sunday expanded a scheme that guarantees loans to Covid-hit businesses to include the aviation sector with maximum assistance for a borrower capped at Rs 200 crore. The fourth iteration of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which has been extended up to September 30, will also fully guarantee loans up to Rs 2 crore to hospitals for setting up oxygen plants.
The ECLGS was introduced by the government to provide relief to small businesses after the first phase of the lockdown last year. Under the latest ECLGS 4.0, an additional 10% of credit limits can be provided and more time can be given to eligible borrowers. The current ceiling of Rs 500 crore of loan outstanding for eligibility under ECLGS 3.0 has been removed, subject to maximum additional ECLGS assistance to each borrower being limited to 40% or Rs 200 crore, whichever is lower. The scheme provided for guarantees on loans of up to Rs 3 lakh crore.

SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said the scheme had proved its value in the first phase of the pandemic. Banks have sanctioned loans worth over Rs 2.5 lakh crore under the scheme, of which Rs 2.4 lakh crore has been disbursed. This would mean that banks have headroom to take up fresh proposals worth about Rs 45,000 crore.
In ECLGS 1.0, borrowers could avail of a loan of four years and repay only interest for the first year. If eligible for restructuring, they can now extend the loan for five years by repaying only the interest component in the first two years.

“Our preliminary assessment is that we should be in a position to build a book of about Rs 2,000 crore,” Khara said, referring to fresh loans under ECLGS 4.0. The loans to hospitals, nursing homes and medical colleges for setting up an oxygen plant would be available at a concessional interest rate of 7.5%.
Rajkiran Rai, chairman of Indian Banks’ Association and MD of Union Bank of India, said that the contours of the scheme have been shared with other banks and while each lender may tweak it according to its policies, most would be able to launch the schemes soon. “With the second wave of Covid and incremental stress on debt servicing of the borrowers, Relief measures under ECLGS will support liquidity position of the borrowers, apart from incremental stress on the asset quality of lenders. The government will also not be burdened with additional cost because of the second wave and this will also improve the utilisation of overall ECLGS funding pool available,” said ICRA’s VP Anil Gupta.

Kolkata: Covid takes toll on health workers’ mental state,3603,"KOLKATA: For over a year, critical care doctor Dipshikha Ghosh has been on Covid-19 duty and has treated over 1,000 patients. On Thursday night, she, along with 40 doctors, came together on Twitter’s live audio chat to discuss mental health issues of healthcare workers. Among the various concerns raised was the psychological impact of the spike in the number of deaths in the second wave.
Ghosh was in the news recently when she had made the video call to a dying patient’s son who sang ‘Tera mujhse hai pehle ka nata koi’ to his mother. According to her, some of her colleagues often talk about taking a sabbatical “after all this is over”. Compared to pre-Covid times, Ghosh estimates that an ICU doctor saw thrice the number of deaths in the first wave. In the second wave, the number has gone up six to eight times. Added to this are the expectations of critically ill patients’ relatives who want doctors to do a miracle. “Initially, they want us to be objective but right before hanging up, they say things like ‘please treat him as your parent’. You don’t know what to say to that,” she said. There have been days when she has written five death certificates. ""The pressure of deciding which relative will be able to handle the news in the event of a death is also immense because often elderly patients have their spouse or siblings listed as next of kin. All that has to be done while simultaneously looking after nine other critically-ill patients,"" she added.

Milan Balakrishnan, a Mumbai-based psychiatrist who was also part of that Twitter Space, said that meta-analysis of current available data reveals that 25% of healthcare workers are suffering from depression while 70% to 80% suffering from distress. “The latter would be sub-clinical restlessness, dissatisfaction and unhappiness. They are more prone to developing depression,” he said.
Psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra points out that breaking bad news several times through a day is “affecting their psyche”. “This emotional counter-transference is leaving many with stress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. I will not be surprised if more than 50% to 70% of the frontline healthcare workers in future suffers from any of these illnesses,” he said.

Doubling the process of grief is the loss of their own family members. “Many are frightened of bringing back the viral infection from their workplace into their homes where their families and loved ones are,” Mitra added.
Sujit Sarkhel, the associate professor of psychiatry at SSKM, has multiple cases of colleague sharing their “helplessness” with him. “Many are finding it difficult to accept deaths of people below 40. Witnessing such a death means 20 or 40 years of productivity gone in just one second,” Sarkhel said. Helplessness also creeps in when the flow of patients overwhelms the capacity of the ICU. “Some doctors, who head the ICU, have to relegate work downstream. They can feel helpless if there is resistance or reluctance on the part of the workforce,” he added.
According to psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram, frontline workers who are going through this will not be the same people anymore. “Social media is helping in community ventilation. Some are using healthy denial to continue functioning. But the paradox is that most are not reaching out to us for professional help,” he said. Sarkhel points out that there is a big gap between identification of burnout and seeking help. ""Lack of motivation and cynicism are symptoms of burnout. Unfortunately, healthcare workers don’t seek help early on unless the problem is very acute,"" he said.

"Inoculation drive gains pace, West Bengal crosses 1 crore first dose mark",2717,"KOLKATA: The Covid vaccination drive in Bengal has begun to pick up pace once again with over 2.5 lakh doses being administered on Friday. With this, Bengal crossed the milestone of administering 1 crore first doses. According to the Co-Win dashboard, a total of 1,01,14,162 people have received their first dose of vaccine since the drive started on January 16 and 38,51,939 got both their doses.
With two more corporate hospitals in Kolkata—Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and Fortis Hospital Anandapur—resuming their vaccination drive on Friday and many others expected to re-launch the programme by next week, health officials hope the drive would gain further momentum. The state health secretary, Narayan Swaroop Nigam, also facilitated a meeting between private hospitals and Serum Institute of India on Friday so that vaccine procurement process could be accelerated.

After procuring 50,000 Covishield doses on Thursday night, RTIICS resumed its inoculation drive by Friday afternoon, when it administered around 650 doses of the vaccine. “Around 90% of the first-dose recipients on the first day of the relaunch were between 18 and 44 years. Thirty of those who got their second doses were our employees. Initially, we would concentrate on on-site vaccination for a few days, but will start off-site programmes soon. We will begin the procurement process for the next lot very soon,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health.
Fortis Hospital Anandapur, which has procured 40,000 doses of Covishield and17,000 Covaxin, started off its vaccination drive from its hospital as well as at camps in five housing apartments. Around 2,500 people were inoculated by them on Friday. “From Monday, we plan to open a vaccination centre at our Minto Park facility so that we can reach out to more people,” said Richa Singh Debgupta, chief of strategy and operations at Fortis Healthcare.

AMRI Hospitals is also expected to get around 1 lakh Covishield doses and another consignment of Covaxin vials next week. So far, only Dhakuria and Mukundapur units have been carrying out the drive with limited Covaxin doses. “We plan an extensive vaccination drive from next week as we expect to procure a good number of vials in a couple of days. Apart from our hospital, we will be going to 120 corporates and associations. Also, we will have a community vaccination centre as the Salt Lake stadium,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.
“We should get about 20,000 Covishield doses by Tuesday. We will start our drive the very next day,” said Simmerdeep Gill, COO CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. Peerless Hospital is also expecting its order by the first week of June.

Odisha: Vaccine tender opening date extended,1861,"BHUBANESWAR: The state government has extended the global e-tender date by seven days in view of requests from many prospective vendors and due to the cyclone. This global e-tender is floated through state PSU Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited (OSMCL) to procure Covid-19 vaccines to inoculate people in the 18-44 years’ age group at a faster pace.
Last date for submission of online bids was 10am on Friday. Opening of the price bid was scheduled at 5pm on the same day. But the state government has given a new date for the bidders to submit their online bid. Now the end date and time of online submissions is 10am on June 4. Online technical bid will be opened at 11.30am on June 4, while price bid will be opened at 5pm on the same day.

On May 10, the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik had given approval to float a global tender to procure Covid-19 vaccines. The cabinet had also resolved to move the Centre for exemption of GST on vaccines, medicines and consumables for Covid-19.
Odisha has 1.93 crore people in the 18-44 year age group. For two doses each, the state needs 3.87 crore doses. The state has placed orders of 2.2 crore Covishield with SII and 10.34 lakh doses of Covaxin with Bharat Biotech. But it has received a few lakhs of doses. As a result, the state has not been able to roll out vaccination across the state.

The state has calculated that at the rate fixed by Bharat Biotech and SII it would pay Rs 1172 crore towards vaccines for the 18-44 years age group with a GST component of Rs 156.72 crore.
Till Thursday, a total of 73, 78,197 doses (66, 16,111 Covishield and 7, 62,086 Covaxin) have been administered to people of the state. Out of which 6, 06,267 healthcare workers, 4, 51,550 frontline workers, 57, 78,095 doses for people of 45+ age group, 5, 42,285 doses for 18+ age group beneficiaries.

"Settled in India, how a German hockey player baked for Covid warriors in Goa",3454,"NEW DELHI: Nothing puts Andrea Thumshirn down. A former German club hockey player, Andrea came to India looking to educate kids through sport. But ever since her project, Hockey Village India, crashed in two Rajasthan villages and corporate jobs in Pune didn't work out, Andrea has been earning and 'baking' her bread in Benaulim, Goa. And in Covid times, the Good Samaritan in her stepped up.
She baked for the healthcare staff of a local hospital, packed the food warmly and added a tag to each of those packets, which read: ""Thank you for being a hero"".

""It has to come from within. I don't know if it is genetic (laughs) or you are made out of that wood where you are always happy to give,"" said Andrea talking to Timesofindia.com
Back in 2017, Andrea's good intentions with 'Hockey Village India' fell prey to alleged fraud and hostility of the locals in Garh Himmat Singh and Jatwara villages in Rajasthan.

So, with her husband, Shivani (a hockey player for whom the couple are the local guardians) and two pet dogs, she made a move to Coorg in Karnataka to run a homestay business. That didn't work out as well and the family packed its bags for Pune after securing jobs for themselves.
Eventually they left their jobs and moved to Goa.

""When we started our Pausenbrot German bakery in November last year, it was already a risky decision because of the pandemic. We had resigned from our jobs in Pune and shifted to Goa, and we had to somehow start earning money,"" said Andrea.
Along the way, Andrea and her husband learned online from a young skilled baker in Germany and got help from an expert sent over by the German government to help them set up their business.
""In Germany, there is a government organisation. They send retired people, like a baker, a butcher, etc., to basically developing countries where such retired professionals can help organisations in training people and build businesses,"" she explained to TimesofIndia.com.
While their business started well, repeated lockdowns were like body blows.

(Andrea and her husband, right, moved to Goa in November 2020 - Facebook Photo)
""The lockdown hit us quite hard. The delivery or takeaway is a small quantity,"" said Andrea. ""There was quite a rise in numbers here (Goa). Everybody was flocking in, all the holiday-makers...The locals got very irritated with the (Covid) behaviour of domestic tourists, not respecting the rules.
""We still have to be careful. It's not over, it's reduced only because we stayed at home.""
The couple then decided to contribute to India's fight against Covid-19 in some way.
""We thought these healthcare workers are working so hard, and we are sitting safe at home...we came to the idea that we will bake for them so that they know that people are thinking about them. We wanted to make their life a little sweeter, even if for a while.""

(The couple tagged each of the 50 food packets with a warm 'thank you' note - Facebook Photo)
Andrea and her husband knew Dr Jayesh, who heads the Covid-19 department at the Victor Hospital in Margao.
""They had a staff of 50 people, so we thought let's do it. We baked 50 cinnamon rolls, 50 mango muffins and gave them a voucher as a gift for a cup of coffee once things are better at our bakery,"" she said with a sense of fulfillment.
""That was a small contribution we could make from our end.""

"Over 2,000 MBBS graduates to serve Maharashtra public healthcare this year",2260,"MUMBAI: More than 2,000 MBBS graduates from the class of 2021 will join government hospitals and assist in the fight against the coronavirus. This year’s cohort will be the largest that will service the mandatory MBBS bond compared to the paltry 10% of graduates who opt to join the state’s public healthcare system each year.


In addition, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) has served notices to those who have not serviced their bond in the past three years and expects them to join too. The rapid influx of additional staffers would hopefully ease the pressure of the current residents who have been working tirelessly through the two waves of the pandemic.
Data from the DMER shows that over 2,100 of the 2,479 MBBS graduates have applied to serve in public hospitals and healthcare centres for a year and merely 38 have opted to pay the charges of Rs 10 lakh and not serve the bond.

With the PG-NEET being pushed till beyond August-end, those from the class of 2020, who are currently in-service, would complete their bond and then take the postgraduate entrance test.
“We have also served notices to those who have not serviced their MBBS bond in the past three years and hope to press more doctors in the system,” said Dr T P Lahane, DMER head. “Under the Pandemic Act, the government has said that action will be taken against those who do not service the bond. Also, with the PG-NEET being pushed to August, students now have a window to service the bond and cut at least a portion of their year-long bond.” Interestingly, graduates who clock the bond tenure partially, can choose to complete the same after postgraduation, if they take the PG- NEET and secure a seat.
Former DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said the number of interns pressed into duty was “impressive”. “Merely 10% of graduates service the bond and another 10%-12% pay the bond charges of Rs 10 lakh.”
From the class of 2018, of the 2,214 students, 278 served the bond and 239 paid the fee. But many graduates from this batch, who would have taken two attempts of the PG-NEET but not secured a seat, would now have to complete their bond.
Students from 2019, 2020 and 2021 batches who have not yet signed up for the service would also be brought into the fold.

Zydus seeks DCGI nod for clinical trials,1559,"AHMEDABAD: Healthcare and pharmaceutical major Zydus Cadila has sought the permission of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to start human clinical trials for monoclonal antibodies cocktail to treat Covid-19. The company’s biological therapy ZRC-3308 is a cocktail of two SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and it can emerge as one of the main treatments for mild Covid-19, the company said on Thursday.
According to Zydus Cadila, the neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based treatments have received emergency use authorization in mild Covid-19 in the US, Europe and in India because they significantly reduced viral load in mild patients and their rate of hospitalization.

Stating that Zydus is the only Indian company to have developed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based cocktail for the treatment of Covid-19, the Ahmedabad-based company added, “Zydus is currently seeking permission to initiate phase 1/3 human clinical trials from the DCGI.”
“At this juncture, there is a critical need to explore safer and more efficacious treatments to combat Covid-19. It is important to look at different stages of the disease progression and look at options that can reduce patient’s suffering and discomfort,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group.

“We believe that ZRC-3308 has the potential to address these concerns and provide a safe treatment,” Patel added. ZRC-3308 has been found to be safe and well tolerated in animal toxicology studies, the company stated.

"Zydus Cadila, Taiwan's TLC ink pact to market black fungus drug in India",1876,"NEW DELHI: Zydus Cadila and Taiwan-based specialty pharmaceutical firm TLC on Wednesday said they have signed a pact to market Liposomal Amphotericin B, a critical drug to treat mucormycosis (black fungus), in India.
The companies have announced signing of an agrement to commercialise AmphoTLC (Amphotericin B Liposome for Injection 50mg) in India, Zydus Cadila said in a statement.

Coronavirus: Live updates
Under the terms of the agreement, TLC will manufacture and supply AmphoTLC on a non-exclusive basis to Zydus, and Zydus will commercialise the drug in India, it added.

""With India facing an acute shortage of the drug to treat mucormycosis, we are making this critical drug available in India on an immediate basis,"" Cadila Healthcare MD Sharvil Patel said.

Covid risk in AC setting? Go for cool IIT-Guwahati 'smart windows',2994,"GUWAHATI: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT-G) have developed smart windows for automatic climate control of buildings, which can come handy in times of Covid by resisting the spread of the virus in residential apartments. These smart glasses can find applications for efficient automatic climate control in vehicles, locomotives, airplanes and greenhouses of the future.
As Covid-19 has imposed an unprecedented risk of cross-infections through aerosol transmission in public buildings where central air-conditioning systems are in use, the experts believe that their smart windows can provide an alternative solution for maintaining ambient indoor temperature, thereby reducing the need of air-conditioning. Dr Debabrata Sikdar, assistant professor at the electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G, along with his research scholar, Ashish Kumar Chowdhary, from the premier technology institute, have designed the smart window materials that can effectively control the amount of heat and light passing through it in response to an applied voltage. The researchers said such smart window materials would help develop efficient automatic climate control systems.

""At present, the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed an unprecedented risk of cross-infections through aerosol transmission in public buildings such as healthcare centres, offices, transportation systems, workshops, laboratories and food storage facilities where central air-conditioning systems are in use,"" said Sikdar.
""There has been increased attention to sustainable architectural designs for better light and heat management in buildings in recent years, and deploying smart windows is the first step for such structures,"" Sikdar said.

Conventionally, window designs are static and they are predesigned for specific climatic conditions. ""The emergent smart windows, on the other hand, can dynamically adjust the amount of light and heat radiation entering a building in response to external stimuli, thus conserving the building's energy,"" he added.
According to the United Nations Environment Programme, buildings around the globe account for 36% of energy use and 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions annually. The climate control system, where energy-consuming devices are used to maintain comfortable indoor temperature and brightness, is the source of primary consumption of energy in buildings. ""A building's heating, cooling, and lighting loads are major energy-consumption segments in any building. To meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, a building's energy intensity- how much energy buildings use-will have to improve by 30% by 2030,"" a IIT-G spokesperson said.
""We have proposed an electro-tuneable glass made of two ultra-thin metal layers sandwiching an electro-optic polymer whose refractive index can be changed by applying a small voltage, which allows filtering of visible and infrared radiation,"" explained researcher Ashish Kumar Chowdhary.

Covid patient with black fungus infection undergoes surgery in Chennai hospital,1142,"CHENNAI: A Covid-19 patient with black fungus infection has undergone surgery in a Chennai hospital.
The patient, a woman, had been treated for Covid pneumonia with systemic steroids and oxygen supplementation for nearly two weeks. She then developed persistent headache on her right side. Nasal discharge was blood-tinged and right eyelid was drooping.

When she came to MGM Healthcare, doctors noticed restricted eye movements and her inability to open the right eye. She also had elevated blood sugar levels during the course of treatment.
''Nasal endoscopy, which showed blackish nasal mucosa in patches, gave rise to the clinical suspicion of mucormycosis. Scans revealed invasive fungal disease limited to the right naso-orbital region involving sinuses,"" said ENT surgeon Dr Sanjeev Mohanty.

A surgery using multiple angled high-definition endoscopes was done to remove black fungus (mucormycosis) that invaded the paranasal sinuses and orbit of the patient. The surgery helped mitigate the spread of the fungus, he said.
Black fungus is a notifiable disease in Tamil Nadu. More than 180 people have been affected by it in the state.

"Goa: Panchayats not doing enough on jab drive, say Pramod Sawant",1924,"PANAJI: Hitting out at panchayats for “only harping on lockdowns”, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the local self-governing bodies are not coming forward to take up the challenge for vaccinating maximum persons in the age group of 45 and above in the villages.
“It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that all family members, even their maids, in this age group are inoculated. Some have already started harping on lockdown again. But not a single panchayat has been able to achieve 100% vaccination in the above 45 age group yet. They could have worked towards it and proudly declared it. It is easy to declare a lockdown in the village. I would have appreciated if they had achieved the vaccination target. We may have even rewarded them,” said Sawant.

It may be recalled that many panchayats declared lockdowns on their own late last month and early this month as Covid cases were on the rise. Villages were of the view that there has been a delay on the part of the state government to declare a lockdown.
“Only the deputy collector and health officer in Canacona have done a very good job and achieved 75% vaccination. I congratulate them. They have meticulously maintained the record too. We still have 2.8 lakh doses available for 45 and above age group. All panchayats should come forward to achieve 100% vaccination in the group. Let them accept my challenge,” said Sawant.

Around 45% persons in the 45 and above age group are yet to receive their jabs, he said. “Maybe around 10% of them are bedridden and cannot come out. But at least 30-35% persons should walk in and take the dose. The panchs, sarpanches and MLAs should take the initiative and see that this target is achieved. MLAs are only announcing in some areas that they have started Covid care centres, but they have not commenced anything on the ground. Only government Covid care centres are operating as of now,” the chief minister said.

‘Blood platelets falling in Covid-19 cases’,1800,"HYDERABAD: Healthcare experts treating Covid-19 patients have revealed that they have identified several cases wherein blood platelet count was low. Experts predominantly said that it was a complication arising out of Covid-19 and in some cases, was a pre-existing problem.
Assistant professor in department of internal medicine at University of Nebraska’s Medical Centre Department, Dr Buddharaju Laxmi Narayana, explained that a lot of patients had chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) predating their Covid-19 infection and this was brought to attention through blood tests for Covid-19.

This is a modal window.

No compatible source was found for this media.

ITP is a blood disorder wherein there is a decrease in the number of platelets in blood. Platelets are blood cells which help to stop bleeding. Speaking at a webinar organised by the Andhra Pradesh health department, Dr Buddharaju said, “We see more ITP in Covid patients. Unless a patient has had signs of bleeding, we have not transfused platelets. A good response to steroids with increase in platelet count would be confirmatory of an ITP diagnosis.”
Research by the Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine at Kolkata Medical College and Hospital found that ITP has emerged as an essential complication arising from Covid-19. In asymptomatic patients, researchers have reported that clinicians have to look into this aspect in the post-recovery period.

“ITP and TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) are predominantly post-Covid related (issues). Blood platelets fall due to immunity issues. We have seen it in several cases. Unless the platelet count is falling below 75,000, we are not treating it. In most of the cases, it is self-lifting and reversable ,” said Dr Galla Viswanath from the AIG Hospitals.

Gujarat: Patriarchy blocks women’s access to healthcare,2676,"AHMEDABAD: Nirmala (name changed to protect identity), a 33-year-old living in Patadi village of Gujarat contracted Covid five days after her husband got the infection. She looked after her husband, prepared his meals, washed his clothes and utensils while he rested and recuperated. She had no choice. However, when she was in need of care, her father-in-law called her parents, and asked them what must be done about it.
Another woman in the village, Kokila (not her real name), was nearly starving since her father-in-law died of Covid. When an ASHA worker in Patadi checked her oxygen levels, they were plunging to 90. Despite complaining, Kokila’s symptoms were ignored by her family and today she’s battling for life against Covid.

The accounts of Kokila and Nirmala are among the few documented in an ongoing study by a Gujarat-based NGO, Society for Women’s Action and Training Initiative (SWATI). The aim is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on girls and women in rural areas. “The study is being undertaken across villages in three districts of Gujarat — Patan, Surendranagar, and Mahisagar,” said Poonam Kathuria, director, SWATI. “We have interviewed a cross-section of people including ASHA workers, Covid survivors, and women in villages. Distressing stories of gender discrimination have come to the fore.”
Gender discrimination and suppression have viscerally existed in the state. Adding a pandemic to the imbalanced equation is forcing women like Nirmala to literally fight for survival, according to the study.

“The plight of daughters-in-law in village families is even worse as they’re stigmatized for risking the entire household,” reveal the findings.
Women often do not get tested despite symptoms. “They are instead made to drink hot water and herbal concoctions, and to take medicines and continue with their chores,” said Jashodaben Bhil, a resident of Radhanpur village who works as a counsellor with SWATI and is aiding the study. “They are made to do all the household work, not allowed to rest, and are stigmatized,” Jashodaben said. “That worsens their health.”
Jashodaben went on to say: “We have come across cases in which women, whose husbands are Covid positive, are made to stay with them and clean after them.” She added: “In turn, the women are often at risk of infection but their need for treatment will not be taken care of.”
According to ASHA workers, nutrition and food intake of families have suffered, the study says. “There have been increased complaints of anaemia, malnutrition and miscarriages over the past year,” the study says. “In a family with an infected member, the needs of a pregnant woman too are neglected.”

‘Those with comorbidities should get vax sans booking’,1854,"Panaji: BJP state president Sadananad Shet Tanavade on Monday urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to provide Covid-19 vaccinations sans online booking to people in the age group of 18-45 years who have comorbid conditions. He also said that vaccines should be given to lactating mothers on priority.
Sawant said the party’s request is being considered.

“We have informed our central leadership that it should intervene and allot Covid-19 vaccines to the state government on priority as per the order placed,” Tanavade said. The state requisitioned for five lakh vaccine doses with Pune’s Serum Institute.
Tanavade said Goa could achieve 100% vaccination status as the state is very small. “Also, if we have to overcome the third Covid-19 wave, we need to vaccinate the entire population of Goa,” he said.

In response to the opposition’s claims, Tanavade said non-Goans working in Goa could take the Covid-19 vaccine in the state. “When they are working in Goa, will they go for vaccination to their respective villages?” he asked.
BJP MLAs are also of the opinion that domestic help should be vaccinated so that they don’t spread Covid-19 at their respective workplaces, Tanavade said, even as he took a potshot at the opposition for criticising the government. He said it should advise the state on how to control the spread of Covid-19 instead. He also slammed the opposition’s criticism over the Class X board exam being cancelled. “The opposition speaks both ways. Last year, it had demanded that the exam be cancelled,” he said.
When asked if the state government’s decision to impose a curfew in the state had come late, Tanavade said no one had anticipated that the second Covid-19 wave would be so massive even as people organised events and celebrated religious festivals. He appealed to anyone who developed a fever to get tested immediately.

Hospital group offers jobs to nurses caught in job fraud,1249,"Kochi: Nearly 41 nurses whose Gulf dream turned sour after they fell prey to a job fraud have been offered employment by VPS Healthcare in different Gulf countries.
These nurses were stranded in the UAE after falling victim to a job fraud for nearly three months. All of them have five to 10 years of working experience in hospitals in India.

VPS Healthcare, one of the largest healthcare groups in the UAE, had been receiving job applications and inquiries from nurses for the past four weeks. Sanjai Kumar, chief human resources officer at VPS Healthcare, said the group has selected eligible candidates through a special interview conducted recently.
“We have given special consideration to eligible healthcare workers who have been trapped for a long time and facing financial issues. Forty-one health workers who have completed the process have already joined the hospitals under VPS Healthcare,” he said. The healthcare workers who do not have a valid medical licence will be joining as patient aide/service assistant.

The fraudsters had wooed the nurses through social media advertisements and promised work at the vaccination centre in the Gulf immediately after the quarantine period, and told them that the licence was not an issue. tnn

Kamat said the state government must pay the compensation as the oxygen shortage was directly and solely attributable to the state government. “Thus, on account of such gross remiss, in its duty, the state government is liable to make payment of compensation to all such affected families of Covid patients who died for want of and or shortage of oxygen at GMC.”
He also pointed out an order dated May 13 passed by the Karnataka HC on a similar issue.TOI had reported that several patients died due to shortage of oxygen at GMC. Following the HC’s intervention, a liquid oxygen tank was installed at GMC.

Manohar Lal Khattar launches 'Sanjeevani Pariyojana' to ensure quick medicare access at home,2044,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar launched anti-coronavirus ""Sanjeevani Pariyojana"" on Monday to ensure proper healthcare facilities in deep pockets of rural areas by having supervised and quick medical care at home.
Khattar launched the initiative from Karnal through video-conferencing. The project will be implemented in other districts of the state subsequently, an official statement said.

The chief minister said his government's priority is to ensure availability of healthcare facilities for the people of the state.
He said collaborative efforts of the government officers and multinational company Deloitte have led to the conceptualisation and implementation of ""Sanjeevani Priyojana"".

Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen, who is a native of Haryana, was keen on contributing towards providing superlative healthcare services in the state, the statement said.
""Deloitte's purpose is to make an impact that matters, and supporting the Haryana government as it delivers much needed medical care to Covid-19 patients is one of the most important impacts we can make,” Renjen said in the statement.
This collaboration will ""extend the medical ward"" by helping those who can recover at home thereby freeing larger hospitals to treat the critically ill.
Renjen expressed gratitude to Dr Dhruv Chaudhary of PGIMS hospital at Rohtak and Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India for mentoring the entire project.
Under the project, the Haryana government will enhance the health facilities and offer a three-tier medical infrastructure to patients, including isolation wards at the village level and sub-centre level, and at Primary Health Care centres for patients with mild symptoms who are unable to isolate at home.
Besides, community health centres or field hospitals at district or sub-district level for patients with moderate symptoms in need of oxygen support and advanced medical centres at larger government, civil or private hospitals equipped with ICU facilities for critical patients.

"Karnataka hires 1,763 doctors under direct recruitment",2200,"BENGALURU: Health minister K Sudhakar on Monday announced that the state government has completed the hiring of as many as 1,763 doctors, including 715 specialists for the government hospitals across Karnataka.
At a time when the government has been struggling to secure the services of specialised doctors for patients coming to their medical institutions, the new hirings is likely to ease the pressure on the state.

“We have completed the hiring and even gazetted the new recruitments who will help in increasing our medical services across the state,” said Sudhakar.
Of the hirings, 715 specialists including 75 MD (general medicine), 57 surgeons, 142 anesthesiologists and 153 paediatricians have been put on government rolls.

“Our biggest recruitment is of anesthesiologists, who are critical in the present pandemic crisis for operating ventilators,” said Sudhakar.
The health minister, however, said the government recieved a rather timid response for radiologists posts with only 17 of them being hired.
Meanwhile, boosting the primary healthcare centres (PHC) and community healthcare centres (CHC), the health department has hired 1,048 new recruits to serve in the almost 3,000 locations.
Sudhakar said the government will try to appoint each of these doctors at their natives in order to reduce attrition, if it happens.
“As much as possible, all doctors will be given the choice of their own native districts and taluks,” he said.
The health minister also added that the government will be providing the risk allowance for all contract medical practioners and even group D workers who wear PPE kits to fight Covid-19.
Black Fungus
Earlier, Sudhakar said Karnataka has reported as many as 443 “suspected” cases of black fungus with 11 of them in home isolation.
“Unfortunately, till date, we have lost 12 people to the epidemice and 433 confirmed hospitalisations,” he said.
He admitted that there is a nationwide shortage of medications for the fungal infection and said the state will be recieving a 1,000 vials of the Amphotericin-B drug as early as tomorrow from the centre.
“With these drugs having to be imported, the centre is allocating it based on the availability,” he said.

It will, however, remain as stand-by centre and will be activated whenever required, the state government order states.
Earlier, the public health department had notified the MPT’s health facility as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital.

Officials have said that all the patients at MPT hospital will now be shifted to “South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda or sub-district hospital, Chicalim, as the case may be, after proper clinical assessment”.
“All the staff deployed at the MPT hospital will either own or of the directorate of health services or the Goa Medical College (GMC), will henceforth report to the nodal officer of South Goa district hospital, Margao (Covid-19 Hospital, Margao) for their further deployment,” the state order states.

Goa: Van with 5 oxygen concentrators to aid patients in rural areas,1221,"MARGAO: Considering the hardships faced by Covid patients and their families in procuring medical oxygen, deputy chief minister and Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar launched “Oxygen-on-wheels” service at Quepem on Sunday.
A van with five oxygen concentrators powered by two generators and emergency medicines, will cater to the needs of patients of not only Quepem taluka, but from remote areas of Canacona, Sanguem, Dharbandora and Salcete as well, Kavlekar said while inaugurating the service.

“The concept behind this is that no life should be lost even in rural Goa. Every life is precious and we have learnt from cyclone Tauktae that we have to be prepared for even worst kind of situation that may arise due to lack of power and transport,” Kavlekar said.
The service can be availed of by calling on the helpline numbers that are manned 24x7, it was informed.

Chairperson of Quepem Municipal Council Suchita Shirvaikar was for the launch of the service.
Kavlekar has already made operational a 24-hours Covid helpline service, whereby Covid patients in need of transport facility to Covid hospitals or step-up centres, are availing the pick-and-drop facility for which five vehicles are deployed, it was informed.

Bengaluru: Healthcare out of reach for people with disability,3105,"BENGALURU: A Covid-19 helpline set up to help people with disability (PWD) in the country recently received a message from a speech impaired man living alone in Bengaluru – the helplines were no help at all for people like him.
“He was trying to book an ambulance but since the government helpline numbers are all IVR-based he could not,” said Mini Jain, who initiated the helpline for PWD. “There is no provision to book an ambulance through message/webform. Eventually, one of our volunteers took the details and helped him book an ambulance.”

For PWD, who have always struggled with inclusion, access to healthcare has become even more difficult due to the pandemic. Volunteers say they receive scores of messages asking for help.
“We were approached by an elderly couple, both visually impaired, who had Covid symptoms but were scared to get tested,” said Jain. “We arranged an online consultation and the doctor convinced them to get tested. They tested positive. The next challenge was to ensure they take the right medications. The doctor, assisted by one of our volunteers, agreed to do a video call and explain how to identify the medicines by touching and recognising the shape and size of tablets. He also helped them arrange and sort the medicines based on dosage.”

After office hours, Mini and more than 40 volunteers help PWDs who call +91-8618803780, their helpline number. They collaborate with various NGOs to provide the assistance required. The group has also organised a vaccination drive in Fraser Town only for PWD.
Volunteers point out that awareness content is largely inaccessible. Also, the dearth of content in sign language affects the speech and hearing impaired. For instance, the Covid test bookings, ambulance helpline and war room numbers are all audio enabled only. Most vaccination centres are not wheelchair friendly.
“The challenges vary based on the disability. For example, the CoWIN portal does not comply with accessibility standards which is a barrier for many seeking slots. Many don’t even have access to technology,” Jain said.
Shivram Deshpande, operations head, Samarthanam trust for the disabled, said: “Arogya Sethu app cannot be accessed by visually impaired people like me. Many hospitals are not equipped to deal with PWDs. My speech and hearingimpaired friends who went to the hospital struggled as they couldn’t communicate.”
Vishnu Soman, founder Smileys India, a volunteerbased NGO, said: “We received a call from parents of a child with Down syndrome. They tested positive and wanted to know who would take care of the child since they had to isolate. It was impossible to get someone who was ready to go to their home. There was another request on whether there’s any special accommodation for Covid positive special children.”
Ballurappa, 33 and a musician with Samarthanam’s music band, said he cannot maintain social distance because he needs someone to take him to the hospital when he is sick. “I’m visually impaired,” he said. “Now, don’t know how to go about getting vaccinated. When and where are PWDs going to get it? We have no clue.”

"Vijai, Damu now spar over vaccination of pharma staff",2198,"Margao: The political slugfest in Fatorda between two local power centres refuses to die down. While earlier this week, the duo were at war over taking credit for the uninterrupted power supply in Fatorda during the blackout, this time, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and his arch rival, BJP general secretary Damodar Naik, sparred over the issue of non-Goans being vaccinated at the Margao urban health centre (UHC).
On Sunday, a notice was put up at the centre announcing that vaccination for workers of pharmaceutical companies has been temporarily withdrawn until further notice. As the notice came just a day after Sardesai and his group of councillors barged into the vaccination centre objecting to the large number of pharma workers queuing up for the jab, GFP lost no time in claiming that it was its diktat that prevailed.

Health officer of the UHC, Anju Kharangate, confirmed that the vaccination has been temporarily suspended upon the instructions of the directorate of health services, but stressed that the move had nothing to do with Sardesai’s protest.
“The proposal for setting up a separate facility for pharma workers at Verna industrial estate is already under the consideration of the health department. The vaccination programmes are conducted under the supervision and instructions of the central government, and not by political considerations,” said Kharangate when asked if the move was prompted by GFP’s objections.

Following Sardesai’s protestations at the vaccination centre on Sunday, Naik had slammed him, terming his “antics” as a “publicity stunt.” Stating that he had already moved a proposal before the government for setting up a vaccination centre at the multi-purpose school complex, Borda, Naik said that Sardesai was ignorant that many pharma workers were residents of Fatorda and thus had every right to get vaccinated at the Margao UHC.
On Sunday, GFP members addressed reporters condemning Naik’s statement and accusing him of working more for the welfare of pharma workers at the cost of locals’ health. “It’s because Sardesai did what he did yesterday that the vaccination for pharma workers has now been kept on hold,” one of them said.

Deaths of healthcare workers in Puducherry: Unions demand good quality PPE kits,2687,"PUDUCHERRY: Representatives of healthcare workers' unions have charged that sub-standard PPE kits provided to them by the government are the root cause of the increasing number of healthcare workers contracting the infection and succumbing to it.
Five healthcare workers had died of the infection in the last three days in the territory, they said.

""We have been urging the health secretary and lieutenant governor to provide us good quality PPE kits. We submitted a memorandum in this regard a month ago. The PPE kits provided by the government now is not good. We can't wear it for more than one or two hours. The healthcare workers remove them as it is very inconvenient. As the government did not respond to our request, we got sponsorship from donors and bought good quality PPE kits. But how long can we get the sponsorship? We don't want the bonus, pay hike or compensation. We want good quality PPE kits. Every day three or four healthcare workers die of Covid-19 infection. Many of us had gone into depression seeing our colleagues die,"" said a representative of the healthcare workers' union.
Her audio pleading the government for good quality PPE kits started circulating widely on social media.

Meanwhile, the Union territory of Puducherry registered the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in a single day on Sunday since the outbreak of the infection in March last year. Thirty-four patients, including nine women, died of the infection in the last 24 hours ending at 10am on Sunday taking the death toll to 1,359. Twenty-two of them did not have any comorbidities.
Puducherry headquarters reported the maximum deaths on Sunday with 24 followed by Karaikal (6) and Yanam (4). Puducherry headquarters has the maximum fatalities with 1,106 followed by Karaikal (146), Yanam (81) and Mahe (26). The fatality rate of the infection stood at 1.4%.

"No Covaxin doses left for 45-plus, healthcare workers in Delhi after May 24: AAP MLA Atishi",1424,"NEW DELHI: There will be no Covaxin doses left for those aged above 45, frontline and healthcare workers in Delhi after Monday, with no clarity on the supply of the next installment from the Centre, AAP MLA Atishi said on Sunday.
She said the national capital has so far received 45.94 lakh vaccine doses for healthcare workers, frontline staff and those aged above 45, of which, 43.79 lakh have been administered to the beneficiaries.

“Delhi has only 25,000 Covaxin doses left for this (above 45 years) category. Though the last installment received from the Centre is being used for second doses, there will be no doses left after Monday,” she said.
The AAP leader rued that there has been no clarity on the supply of the next installment of Covaxin for this category, though the central government had promised to provide more doses in June.

She said the city has received 8.17 lakh vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group so far, of which, 8.07 lakh doses had been utilised by Sunday morning.
“Vaccination centres administering Covaxin have already been shut. Similarly, Covishield inoculation centres will have to be closed from Monday,” she said.
Atishi noted that 64,214 people received the vaccine jabs on May 22.
A total of 50.85 lakh doses have been administered to the beneficiaries in Delhi since the nationwide inoculation drive began on January 16. Around 11.51 lakh people have got both the doses, she added.

"Uttarakhand to start antigen tests at all community, primary healthcare centres",1753,"DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand will start rapid antigen tests at all government community and primary healthcare centres (CHCs and PHCs) across the state, aiming to make testing accessible in remote hill districts, which have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths in the last two months. An order making this mandatory was issued by secretary (in-charge), health, Dr Pankaj Pandey on Friday.
Director of medical education and health, Uttarakhand, Dr SK Gupta, said that there are 79 CHCs and 578 PHCs across the state currently and barring some, most of these have Covid-19 testing facilities. “We also have 494 mobile teams to collect samples from remote areas,” added Dr Gupta. “The facility should be made available at the earliest in all the CHCs and PHCs where it’s not happening currently,” said Dr Pandey.

Anoop Nautiyal, a social activist who is tracking the Covid-19 situation in the state, said, “With large number of patients in home isolation in state’s rural areas, it is critical to see if these patients fulfil the isolation guidelines issued by the centre and ICMR. Also, so many patients staying at home does not bode well, as they will not get proper medical care and that might increase mortalities.”
While testing is the first step to arrest the rising number of Covid cases, healthcare infrastructure is also in a shambles in the hills. As per the data of Panchayati Raj Department, there were 15,981 active Covid-19 cases in rural areas on May 18, out of which 14,851 (93%) were in home isolation and only 1,008 (6%) patients were hospitalized.

Among the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand, Pauri, Tehri, Almora and Rudraprayag are the worst affected. These five have recorded positivity rates above 20% almost every day in May.

"Will reconsider current rates of Covid treatment, Jharkhand assures private hospitals",1021,"RANCHI: The state government on Friday gave the managements of private hospitals in Ranchi and across Jharkhand a verbal assurance to look into the existing rates of Covid-19 treatment. Representatives from various private hospitals sat across the table with health secretary Arun Kumar Singh and flagged their concerns at the department’s campus in Namkum.
The Association of Healthcare Providers India urged the department to remove the existing capping on treatment rates of Covid-19. In an effort to stop overcharging in treatment of coronavirus patients in private hospitals, state health department in April this year fixed the treatment charges from Rs 4,000 per day to Rs 18,000 depending on the class of city, certification of the hospital and the kind of bed occupied.
“In many cases, the government takes action against hospitals over tweets and messages on social media. We urged the government that it should conduct a probe before taking such action,” Yogesh Gambhir, the state president of AHPI, told TOI.

Kerala govt tells private hospitals to install medical oxygen plants,2791,"KOCHI: As Kerala battles a dramatic rise in Covid cases and subsequent oxygen shortage due to transportation issues, the state government has now asked all private hospitals to install pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants.
The state government is also in the process of installing more such plants in its facilities. While major private hospitals are looking at joining hands to install a joint plant, small and medium hospitals have expressed inability to spend huge amounts on the plant.



The government plans to use PSA medical oxygen generation plant facility to supply oxygen to beds with oxygen facility in the hospital wards or rooms, where 60% to 65% Covid patients are admitted. However, in the ICUs, liquid oxygen will be used. “For the ICUs we will need to use liquid oxygen to maintain pressure.

However, with PSA plants in place, the excess demand for liquid oxygen will come down, ensuring that there is no shortage of the same for critical patients in the ICU and those in need of ventilator support,” said Dr Santosh Kumar S S, deputy medical superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram medical college.
Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd has been asked to procure 35 PSA - oxygen generation plants and to establish them at the government hospitals in order to augment oxygen generation capacity at the health care institutions in the state. “…pleased to instruct all private hospitals to install PSA oxygen generation plants of adequate quantity corresponding to the bed capacity,” said the government order signed by health secretary Dr Rajan Khobgragade.
However, many cash-starved private hospitals have raised concerns. “PSA oxygen generation is not practical for small and medium hospitals, mainly due to the cost and lack of infrastructure facilities and for bigger hospitals due to centralized supply whether it would be able to maintain pressure ensuring proper oxygen supply. Due to this, liquid oxygen is needed,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.
Meanwhile, some of the big players are planning to join hands to invest together to set up plants. “Rather than having an independent plant, we feel that it is better to partner and share oxygen. It is economical and feasible then. We are already in talks with hospitals,” said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and managing director, KIMS Healthcare Group and president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter).
Even Kerala Private Hospital Association (KPHA) has set up a sub-committee to study the matter in detail and see if hospitals in the vicinity or adjacent districts should come together to set up the plant and whether such a plant is feasible and required for all hospitals.

Black fungus: More to it than just steroids,3165,"NEW DELHI: Is the use of steroids the primary reason for the upsurge in black fungus infection? While the primary cause of mucormycosis is overuse of steroids, doctors said other factors are also responsible for the spike. Senior doctors argue that steroids have been used to treat several diseases, but never in recent years has such an exponential increase in mucormycosis been seen.
Dr Uma Kumar, head of rheumatology at AIIMS, reasoned, “We have used steroids for weeks, months and in some cases, years, but in my career, I hadn’t seen such a rise in black fungus cases. There has to be other factors involved, and they should be investigated.” She added that sanitation and healthcare associated with fungal infections were also concerns.

Immunosuppressants, transplants, diseases like leukaemia, AIDS, kidney and liver conditions and malnourishment predispose an individual to mucormycosis, noted Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman, Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol. “Also, if a hospital or home is contaminated with moulds on walls or the ventilation system or medical supplies are not well sterilised, black fungus infection can occur,” he said. “Mould grows on stale bread, vegetables and fruits.”
Doctors also stated that the purity of oxygen did not have a role in triggering mucormycosis. Dr Vidit Tripathi, senior ENT consultant at Fortis Hospital, said, “It is an opportunistic infection in any medical condition causing reduced immunity, such as cancer, chronic kidney disease or AIDS. Long standing hypoxia caused by Covid and increased ferritin (blood protein) level in blood as observed in some Covid patients are also factors. The purity of oxygen or humidifier isn’t significant.”

However, Dr Sandeep Garg, pulmonologist at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, felt that besides the use of industrial oxygen, even the improper use of medical oxygen was a danger. “Medical oxygen requires humidification before administration to patients. The gas, therefore, has to pass through a container filled with sterile water. The water itself must be sterilised and changed frequently as per protocol. If the water is not sterile, it is potentially a source of black fungus infection,” said Garg.
While emphatic that steroids weren’t the only factor, Dr Ameet Kishore, senior ENT consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, conceded that high doses of steroids over a prolonged period caused a sugar spike that could result in black fungus infection. “Indiscriminate and unmonitored use of steroids can cause a steep spike in sugar levels. If this goes unchecked, it leaves the individual susceptible to mucormycosis,” said Kishore. “Steroid medication should, therefore, be done under the supervision of a healthcare expert.”
In addition to doses and duration of steroid administration, diabetes as a comorbidity was a big factor, pointed out Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Institute of Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare. “Steroid cause sugar levels to jump. Another trigger is ferritin, which is usually high in Covid patients and the mucor fungus feeds on iron produced in the body because of this protein,” explained Budhiraja.

"'It's like hell': As Tokyo Olympics loom, Japan's healthcare system in turmoil",7955,"TOKYO: As she struggled to breathe, Shizue Akita had to wait more than six hours while paramedics searched for a hospital in Osaka that would treat her worsening Covid-19.
When she finally got to one that wasn't overwhelmed with other patients, doctors diagnosed severe pneumonia and organ failure and sedated her. Akita, 87, was dead two weeks later.

""Osaka's medical systems have collapsed,"" said her son, Kazuyuki Akita.
He has watched from his home north of Tokyo as three other family members in Osaka have dealt with the virus, and with inadequate health care.

""It's like hell.""
Hospitals in Osaka, Japan's third-biggest city and only 2 1/2 hours by bullet train from Summer Olympics host Tokyo, are overflowing with coronavirus patients. About 35,000 people nationwide — twice the number of those in hospitals — must stay at home with the disease, often becoming seriously ill and sometimes dying before they can get medical care.

As cases surge in Osaka, medical workers say that every corner of the system has been slowed, stretched and burdened. And it's happening in other parts of the country, too.
The frustration and fear are clear in interviews by The Associated Press with besieged medical workers and the families of patients in Osaka. It's in striking contrast with the tone in the capital Tokyo, where Olympic organizers and government officials insist the July Games will be safe and orderly even as a state of emergency spreads to more parts of the country and a growing number of citizens call for a cancellation.
Some see Osaka as a warning for what could happen to the rest of Japan if the crisis worsens at a time when officials — and the world — are focused on the Olympics.
Osaka's struggles are a ""man-made disaster,"" Akita told AP in a written message, caused in part by officials lifting an earlier state of emergency despite signs of a rebound in infections. He thinks his mother might have lived if she'd been treated sooner.
Many here are stunned by what's happening. Japan, after all, is the world's third-biggest economy and has, until now, managed the pandemic better than many other advanced nations. But the current surge has sent the daily tallies of the sick and dying to new highs.

The turmoil is most evident in Osaka.
Paramedics, clad in protective gear, cannot perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and must take extreme precautions to avoid exposure to aerosols, officials and health workers say. Disinfecting an ambulance takes an hour after it has carried a COVID-19 patient, keeping paramedics from rushing to the next call.
Emergency patients get only the treatment that happens to be available, not what's most likely to increase their chance of survival, medical experts say.
A patient suffering from heart failure, for example, was rejected by an advanced emergency hospital, and a child in critical condition could not find a pediatric hospital because they were all full, according to an Osaka paramedic who would only give his first name, Satoshi, because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The child later died, he said.
""Our job is to bring people who are dying and deteriorating to the hospital,"" he said.
""In the current situation, we are not even able to do our job.""

As the vaccination pace gradually picks up, the government plans to open two large inoculation centers Monday using Moderna shots, one of two new vaccines expected to be approved Friday.
This week Osaka passed Tokyo, the nation's biggest city, with the most total virus deaths, at 2,036. Of about 15,000 patients in Osaka, only about 12% landed at hospitals, while the rest had to wait at home or in hotels. The number of COVID-19 deaths that happened outside of hospitals in April tripled from March to 96, including 39 in Osaka and 10 in Tokyo, police statistics show.
Japan's daily cases and deaths are small by global standards, and the country has one of the world's largest per-capita numbers of hospital beds.
So why the struggles?
It is partly because unprofitable COVID-19 treatment is largely limited to public-run hospitals, which account for only about one-fifth of Japan's 8,000 hospitals. Private hospitals, many of them small, are hesitant or unprepared to deal with coronavirus cases.

"Bombay high court tears into Goa government for seeking Covid certificate waiver for 5,400 workers",3603,"PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa slammed the state government for filing applications seeking to waive the requirement of a Covid negative certificate for over 5,400 persons who travel to Goa every day for employment from neighbouring states, when the positivity rate was 32%.
“Even as of May 17, though the positivity rate has fallen to 32.7%, it is perhaps the highest in the entire country. This application for waiver, therefore, cannot be regarded as being made in any public interest or to find some balance between arresting the spread of the epidemic and legitimate economic concerns,” the court stated in its order passed on May 18.



According to the government, as many as 3,443 and 1,992 workers enter Goa daily from Maharashtra and Karnataka, respectively. The court said that if there were no restrictions on entry into Goa, the state’s medical infrastructure would completely collapse.

While seeking waiver of a Covid negative certificate, the government assured that the workers would be thermally scanned at the respective checkposts. The government tried to make its case by pointing out that as of May 10, hardly 0.25% of the travellers entering Goa had tested positive for Covid-19.
“The statistics pointed out in this application are misleading because they refer to the tested cases, which themselves may be few. The tested cases are not restricted to entrants by road alone. The statistics ignore the untested and asymptomatic cases. Therefore, based on the statistics referred to in the application, no case is made out for variation or vacation of our interim order,” a division bench comprising Justice M S Sonak and Justice M S Jawalkar observed.
The court noted that even if the workforce of approximately 3,443 people is permitted to enter Goa without a negative RT-PCR certificate, they will require a negative certification from Goa to enter into Maharashtra in the evening. It is not clear as to whether the workforce from Karnataka can actually travel into Goa and thereafter return on the same day without proof of vaccination or an RT-PCR negative certificate, the court said.
Advocate general Devidas Pangam said Goa has to rely upon its neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka for supplies, labour, and workforce. He submitted that the restriction has been affecting Goa’s economy and the smooth operation of industries, including those concerned with combatting the Covid-19 pandemic.
The government trying to seek waiver for residents of Goa or persons coming for work into Goa “overlooks the unfortunate fact that the coronavirus makes no distinction between the residents of Goa or persons entering for work into Goa…,” the court stated.
To the ICMR advisory placed before the high court by the advocate general stating that the need for RT-PCR tests in healthy individuals undertaking interstate domestic travel may be completely removed to reduce the load on laboratories, the high court pointed out that this was issued on May 4 in context of the general position of the epidemic throughout the country.
“To that extent, the focus of the advisory was not on the peculiar situation in the state of Goa. Here, almost 2,000 deaths have been reported since the epidemic raised its ugly head in March 2020, out of which almost 1,000 deaths took place in the last 10 days or thereabouts,” the court stated.
“The position of the state-run medical facility, ie GMC, was too horrendous to recall, particularly in the context of overstretched demand on medical infrastructure, oxygen, and even on the medical and paramedical staff,” the court stated.

"Goa's recovery rate at 84%, but Thursday sees 44 deaths",1922,"PANAJI: Goa reported 1,582 fresh Covid-19 cases, 44 casualties, and 3,694 recoveries on Thursday. While the recovery rate rose to 84 %, the case positivity rate increased to 35% as against 31% on Wednesday. The state currently has about 20,800 active cases.
While there has been a dip in new cases since Saturday, health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that a wait of few more days is warranted to know if Goa has seen its peak.

Goa Medical College (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar, said that there’s been a drop in admissions. Thursday saw 68 Covid patients admitted. Also, there were no patients either on the hospital floor or on trolleys, he said.
The state’s Covid-19 toll meanwhile rose to 2,273, with 44 casualties recorded over the past 24 hours. Of these, 22 deaths were reported at GMC, 12 at the South Goa district hospital, five from private hospitals, one casualty each from the sub-district hospitals of Ponda and Chicalim and one death reported from the primary health centre, Chicalim.

Three deceased had been vaccinated, with one even receiving both doses.
Meanwhile, the state government has decided to implement a technology-based system to regularly track and follow-up on patients under home isolation. “We have selected an agency, Step One, that is providing this service in 11 other states,” Dhawan said.
While the agency’s service is free, the government will incur the cost of call charges, which will be paid directly to BSNL, he said.
The first call to the patient will be made through health services to obtain details, which will be entered in the portal. From the second to the tenth day, calls will go from the system and the patient will be questioned about five parameters to monitor their health status. If the response to any two questions is “yes” the patient will get a red flag, and a backend team of doctors will follow-up so there is timely intervention before their condition deteriorates.

Goa: Cansaulim facility helps avert deaths,1650,"VASCO: The Cansaulim Primary Health Centre (PHC), which was converted into a step-up Covid centre 10 days ago, has seen 49 admissions so far. The 50-bedded facility caters to patients with comorbid conditions and ensures that their condition remains stable.
Health officer of Cansaulim PHC Dr Soccour Quadros said that in the past 11 days, since the step-up facility was set up, no Covid patient with comorbidities has died. “The hospital does not have ventilators and so we admit Covid-19 positive patients with comorbidities with normal oxygen levels,” he said.

It has 17 oxygen cylinders and four oxygen concentrators. “We admit patients from nearby areas i.e. Cortalim constituency, but also those from other areas on call. Patients with diabetes, or fever for 6-7 days, who have tested positive, are admitted here. Sometimes patients are referred from other hospitals,” Quadros said.
The Verna Industrial Estate, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, has helped the hospital with free supply of medicines.

From May 10, since the hospital commenced operations as a step-up Covid Care Centre it has had 49 admissions in all. Of these, 25 have been discharged after recovery. Ten have been referred to other hospitals like ESI, Margao or Goa Medical College for further treatment.
At present, as of Thursday, only 11 are undergoing treatment at the Cansaulim centre, including two children.
Meanwhile, the newly constructed Cansaulim PHC also provides general OPD facilities to villagers. In the basement area, they carry out antigen and RT-PCR tests to detect Covid. The first and the second floors are dedicated to Covid-19 patients.

Rajasthan: Villagers bank on black magic to keep coronavirus at bay,2699,"JAIPUR/AJMER: Meandering through the deserted alleys of dusty Dantra Bandh village in Bhilwara, you can’t miss shoes and slippers tied at the doors.
The village, which has recorded 28 deaths in the last 31 days mostly due to influenza like illness (ILI), is following the diktat of a ‘bhopa’ (quack) of keeping the virus at the bay. He warned the 500 households that Covid has set on the earth to revenge for the killings made by their ancestors.

“Tying footwear at the doors would scare the virus from entering your house. This method has been successful in saving our lives and those who have died are those who mocked it,” said Mohan Lal Khateek, a villager, who has lost three of his relatives due to what he claimed ‘unknown’ reasons.
He firmly believed that those who go to the hospital will return dead in a PPE kit.

The pandemic has thrown a light on how quacks and sect leaders govern the life of the villagers is costing dearly in the pandemic. They are working overtime suggesting ways and activities based on ‘superstition’ to protect people from Covid while giving them an alternate to healthcare system.
From placing slippers at doors to burning coconuts outside the house and to forming mustard oil circles around the houses to wearing neem and tulsi trees around the neck, several strange ‘remedies’ are being suggested by the quacks.
The people of Umand village in Kapasan, Chittorgarh, are having a hard time for the last two days due to incessant rain. Rainwater is flooding their houses as for the last 20 days, every household here is not closing the doors. Reason: The village tantrik, who is also a local priest, has asked the villagers to not lock their houses as he is burning sacred wood to eliminate the virus. “The smoke of the wood would kill the virus,” said Pabba Lal, a villager, who said they guard outside the house every night fearing the entry of stray and wild animals.
The village has a population of 2,500 people who say the visuals of people in big cities dying for want of beds and medicines have made them believe that they have no place in the government healthcare system.
For the last seven days, the villagers of Lacchipura village in Pisagan village in Ajmer are busy singing carols and hymns around a fire at the centre of the village. They believe that Covid is an evil spirit that will be eliminated by the sacred fire and worshipping Goddess Mata Rani.
“Neither PM Modi nor the CM Gehlot would save from the misery of Covid other than our deities. If we keep our deities happy, they will ensure our happiness,” said Dinesh Kumar, a villager. The villagers have kept the trolley full of wood in advance to make sure the ritual runs uninterrupted.

Bengaluru: IISc startup gets nod to produce hand-held test kit,1497,"BENGALURU: PathShodh Healthcare, a Bengaluru-based startup, which had developed a first-of-its-kind hand-held semi-quantitative electrochemical ELISA test kit for Covid-19 antibodies, has received licence from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to manufacture the product for sale.
PathShodh is incubated at the Society for Innovation and Development, Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Vinay Kumar, CEO, PathShodh, said: “The technology can detect Covid-19 antibodies all the way down to the nanomolar concentration. It can work with venous or capillary (finger-prick) whole blood sample or serum sample. We plan to deploy the product in the market in the next couple of weeks.”

The kit has been validated at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, as per requirements of the ICMR.
IISc said: “The novelty of the technology is based on the measurement of electrochemical redox activity of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S1). The S1 protein has a receptor binding domain (RBD) which latches on to the ACE2 receptors on the host cells before infection. Hence, antibody tests targeting the S1 spike protein are more representative of immune response against infection compared to those that target the nucleocapsid (N) protein.”

This test has been developed by leveraging PathShodh’s Lab-on-Palm platform “anuPathTM”, which interfaces with disposable test strips functionalised with an immunoreceptor specific to Covid-19 antibodies.

"Bereaved healthcare providers set aside personal losses, report to work",2701,"Kolkata: They have either lost a family member to Covid or even had to stay in isolation for testing positive to the virus. But with a long battle ahead, they have not even had the time to mourn the passing away of their loved ones as their profession demands they return to the frontline to tend to the infected. With each passing day, doctors, nurses and other support staff are setting exemplary examples of selflessness to pull the state out of the crisis.
When Santoshpur resident Nirmal Krishna Chaudhuri (88) died on May 4, his microbiologist son Bhaskar Narayan was on mandatory home quarantine as he, his wife and daughter had tested positive. The head of the microbiology and molecular biology at Peerless Hospital has been spearheading the lab where Covid samples are being tested. He could not even have a last look at his father, forget about performing the last rites. Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra completed the formalities of handing the body to civic bodies for cremation.

“I went back to lab on the first day after completing my quarantine as coordinating from home was really difficult. I could not sit back at home mourning when so many patients need Covid confirmation report on time so that medical care is not delayed,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri.
Nursing assistant Sraboni Mandal had lost her mother to Covid recently and she herself testing positive in April-end. Mandal was back in the Covid ward at CMRI right after completing the mandatory home isolation. “It is still tough to accept that I have lost my mother. But I have to think about hundreds of patients who need me to feed them food, give medicine,” said Mandal.

OT technician Subhasish Khanra was in the Covid ICU at Apollo on April 28 when he got the news that his 35 year-old brother had lost the battle against Covid pneumonia in another private hospital. Khanra rushed home after finishing his duty, spent the next day with family only to swing back to work the next day.
“This time, we are seeing many younger patients in the ICU where we have assist in procedures like intubation, monitor oxygen saturation and perform CPR on patients at times. Even if I help in saving a life, it consoles me thinking that somebody’s brother/sister will go back to their families,” said Khanra.
Pulmonologist Raja Dhar lost his father to Covid and later his mother, wife and he also tested positive to the infection, all needing hospital care. Dhar had been a part of the core Covid team and Fortis earlier and now with CMRI. “If it was not for Covid, I probably could have spent more days at home with family after my father’s death. But I could not afford that as the pandemic is not stopping any time soon,” said Dhar.

"‘Vaccination for healthcare and frontline workers, 45+ stopped due to lack of vaccine’",4931,"Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu shares the state government’s efforts in fighting the deadly coronavirus with TOI’s Sanjeev Verma. Excerpts:
When is the next dose of Covid vaccine coming from the Centre as vaccination has been stopped at many centres in Punjab since last Thursday?

Almost all vaccination centres for health care and frontline workers and the 45-plus population are not functioning due to lack of vaccine. There is only stock left for 18-44 year age groups and we do not have any information regarding the next supply of vaccine from the Centre.
You are going in for global tenders of the Covid vaccine. Which companies are you looking for, like Haryana is looking for Sputnik V. Many vaccines like Pfizer and Moderma need to be stored at minus temperature and need appropriate infrastructure. How will you manage?

This matter is being discussed by the state experts on vaccination. Once we get their recommendations, we will decide accordingly.
There is hue and cry that many hospitals in Punjab don’t have manpower to operate ventilators. Are you recruiting?
There is no shortage of trained manpower to operate ventilators at L3 health facilities. There is a problem with ventilators received from the Centre.
What are the main reasons for the spike in cases during the ongoing second wave in Punjab? Do you think that farmers’ protests and their to and fro travel from protest sites at Delhi borders have also resulted in increasing Covid-19 cases?
The primary cause of increase in cases is that people do not follow Covid protocols like wearing face masks, social distancing, hand sanitisation and avoiding large gatherings. Also, the new B.1.617 variant, is more infectious than the previous type which is mainly responsible for this rise.
How many black fungus cases have been reported in Punjab till date and what are your preparations to deal with such cases?
So far, only two cases of black fungus have been reported in the state. Our health system is prepared to handle such cases and we have adequate arrangement for management of these cases.
Medical specialists are predicting the third Covid wave to be more deadly. What is the Punjab government plan to deal with it?
We are aware of predictions of the third wave and are preparing for it. We have increased our L2 and L3 beds and further increased them. We have sufficient ventilators and ICU beds and are further increasing their numbers. More than 10,000 medical and paramedical staff like specialists, medical officers, community health officers, staff nurses, ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives), lab technicians and pharmacists among others have been recruited in the health department.
How much Covid testing is being done in rural areas? Are there any farmers who are refusing to get tested?
Of the total tests being conducted, about 40% are being done in rural areas. There was some reluctance for testing in rural areas but that has changed now and people areas are coming forward for testing. There is no refusal by farmers for testing. We are going to increase testing in rural areas. If any symptomatic person is found, the whole family would be tested using the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). Positive patients would be provided timely treatment, as per the condition of the patient.
Have you analysed as to why the mortality rate of Covid patients on ventilator support is very high?
Globally, the survival rate of Covid patients on ventilators is very low. But here patients report to health facilities very late and with severe disease and many of them need ventilator support. Due to late presentation at the health facility with advanced disease, sometimes it becomes difficult to save them. Hence the health department has launched an awareness drive to sensitise people to get themselves tested at the earliest.
What is the present status of per day medical oxygen supply in Punjab?
There is need of about 300 MT oxygen required daily in the state. Presently, the situation is hand to mouth and we are managing somehow. But we need more oxygen daily.
What action has been taken against those indulging in black marketing of life-saving medicine and injections, and oxygen in Punjab?
We are closely monitoring the situation and strict action would be taken if any such instance is detected. Punjab government has committed to ensure the supply of quality drugs in the state and to achieve this aim, 60 drug control officers have been deputed to keep a vigilant eye on the supply of medicines.
What specific steps have been taken to check increasing cases of Covid-19 in five worst- performing districts of Punjab?
We are increasing testing in these areas. We are creating awareness in people regarding Covid appropriate behaviour. Vaccination efforts are being intensified. We are encouraging people to get tested even with mild symptoms so that timely detection of disease and its management can be ensured.

CM: Govt strengthening healthcare at local level,1252,"Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said dedication and service spirit is the identity of Rajasthanis.
Addressing the virtual launch ceremony of 700 oxygen concentrators at 37 places on behalf of Bharatiya Jain Sangathan,Gehlot said, “Wherever people went, they set an example with their sense of service. Whenever there is a disaster, they have always been at the forefront of working for their motherland. They are also setting new dimensions of social concern in meeting the serious challenge of Covid.” He said Rajasthanis have never lagged in providing relief during natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes, famines and droughts. The chief minister appreciated the efforts of Bharatiya Jain Sangathan for their contribution in social work.
He said this was the time to serve humanity by rising above the considerations of caste, religion, class, ideology and region. He said the state government took every section together in the fight against corona and took decisions which brought relief to the needy. ‘Nobody sleeps hungry’ has been our mantra, he said, adding in the first wave, our management was praised at home and abroad. “But now the challeng is even bigger, for which everyone will have to work in unison,” he added.

Co-WIN glitches vex 18-plus in search for jab slots,2253,"GUWAHATI: After health minister Keshab Mahanta tweeted that Assam has 3.65 lakh Covid-19 vaccines in stock, 1.49 lakh for the 45+ and 2.16 lakh for the 18 to 44 year category, the young generation was left confused about the purpose of creating a vaccine bank when the need of the hour was urgent inoculation given the steady rise in the number of cases.
""I have been trying for a slot for the last five-six days but have not got any. I found 200 slots in my location in Guwahati on Sunday but all slots vanished within seconds of clicking on the select button. This is happening with many of my friends,"" said Braja Thakuria, a youth, who registered his name on Co-WIN on May 3.

Thousands of people in the 18-44 age group across rural and urban Assam are searching for slots on smartphones. Even more helpless are people from underprivileged backgrounds, who do not have smartphones or are not familiar with Co-WIN. Leading student-youth organizations as well as the Assam chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have raised serious concerns over the population, which still does not have access to digital gadgets to register their names on Co-WIN.
""Healthcare should be universal and the vaccination process should have been simplified. Will the illiterate people be left out of the vaccination drive if they do not register their names in Co-WIN?"" wondered Dr Satyajit Borah, president, IMA's Assam state branch.

The All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) have decided to help the needy to register their names on the Co-WIN platform.
Aasu general secretary Sankar Jyoti Baruah said, ""There seems to be a large scarcity of vaccines for the 18+ age group. But it was not so for the 45+ category. Despite having several vaccination centres in districts, the 18-44 age group people are being vaccinated only in a few centres, and that too through a complicated process.""
The central leadership of Aasu has already appealed to its district, sub-divisional and local committees to extend support to the 18+ people who have not been able to register themselves and are desperately searching for slots amid an alarming Covid situation that has led the state government to impose new restrictions.

"Pune: Over 64,000 rural healthcare and frontline staff yet to get second jab",2392,"PUNE: More than 64,000 healthcare (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) in rural Pune are yet to receive their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, a report by the zilla parishad (ZP) has said.
Ayush Prasad, CEO of the ZP, said given the high pendency, these individuals (total of 64,859) would be given shots on priority during upcoming vaccine drives.



“Most of these HCWs and FLWs received Covaxin in the first round. There was a supply issue with the vaccine and many could not get their second dose on time,” Prasad said.

According to the report, 14,340 HCWs and 50,519 FLWs are yet to get their follow-up shots. Officials from the ZP said a total of 48,674 HCWs were given their first shots in Pune rural. And most were given their shots during the first four weeks of the vaccine drive.
“But their second doses were delayed due to varied reasons. A significant number of HCWs got infected by the virus after receiving their first dose so they had to wait to complete the stipulated gap. Secondly, some of the HCWs were confused about the intervals between the first and second jabs,” a senior official from the health department said. As for the frontline workers, the health department official said, “Initially, their response to vaccination was limited. But as cases began increasing in the first week of March, many started to come forward. By the time their second dose was due, the Centre had extended the interval between the shots.” Data showed that Khed tehsil has administered the lowest number of second doses to FLWs, among the 13 tehsils that make up rural Pune. A total of 12,517 FLWs there have been given the first dose. But only 3,229 have received the second.
Dr BB Gadve, tehsil health officer, Khed, said, “Shortage of vaccine doses and poor response from FLWs are the reasons. We’re now making a list of beneficiaries to administer the second dose as soon as possible.”
However, some HCWs and FLWs said they were unable to get their second shots despite visiting vaccination centres.
“We were worried about catching Covid because scores of people were gathering at these sites. So we kept delaying our second dose,” a police constable from the Loni Kalbhor station said.
A senior zilla parishad official said, “It’s the healthcare workers who are most at risk of catching Covid as many work at health centres. So we’ll finish their vaccination at the earliest.”

"Puducherry: Recoveries outnumber new cases, doubling time 40 days",1939,"PUDUCHERRY: The doubling rate of the Covid-19 cases reduced to 40 days in Puducherry on Monday. The doubling rate dipped to as low as 15 days during the peak of the first wave of infection in August last year.
While the Union territory had reported 42,949 cases until April 7 this year, it doubled to 85,952 on May 17 — in 40 days.

On Monday, the UT reported 1,446 fresh cases, 1,701 recoveries and 28 deaths in the 24 hours ending at 10am on Monday, leaving behind 17,383 active cases. Of them, 15,281 are in home isolation and treatment.
Puducherry headquarters continued to report most fresh cases (1,210), followed by Karaikal (147), Yanam (78) and Mahe (11). Puducherry headquarters also has the maximum active cases with 14,095, followed by enclaves Karaikal (1,979), Yanam (1,054) and Mahe (255).

The 28 deaths took the UT’s toll tally to 1,179. Twelve of the patients reported dead on Monday did not have any comorbidities and all 28 deaths were in Puducherry headquarters. The fatality rate of the infection in the UT os 1.4%.
The territory has so far reported 85,952 cases and a recovery rate of 78.4%, which is less than the national average of 84.1%. Puducherry currently has 20.2% active cases, which is higher than the national average of 14.1%.
The positivity rate of the samples (8,056) tested on Monday stood at17.4%. Healthcare authorities have so far administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to 1.81 lakh people and both doses to 49,822.
Meanwhile, the Puducherry administration has decided to increase oxygen beds at the Indira Gandhi government medical college and research institute (IGMC) to 300, besides expediting work to set up piped oxygen supply there.
All pharmacies have been asked to e-mail the price list of gadgets including pulse oximeter, oxygen concentrators to medicaldevices-nppa@gov.in within seven days, said a direction by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) on Saturday.

2nd vax dose pushed back 4 weeks for 49k healthcare workers,3397,"Nagpur: Around 49,390 healthcare workers (HCWs) from 11 districts of Vidarbha have not taken second dose of Covid-19 vaccine despite completion of the earlier maximum interval of eight weeks from first dose. Now, they will have to wait for another few weeks due to revision in gap to minimum 12 weeks and maximum 16 weeks.
The government had rolled out vaccine for HCWs— doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians and other staff working in government and private hospitals — on January 16. At that time, second dose of Covishield as well as Covaxin was suggested after 28 days from first dose.

As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), 1,76,794 HCWs took first dose by March 21. The government on March 22 increased interval between two doses of Covishield to 6-8 weeks. The gap of 56 days was completed for these HCWs on May 16.
As per PHD data, 1,27,404 (72.06%) HCWs had taken the second dose by May 16. Thus, 49,390 HCWs are pending for second dose.

Majority of HCWs had taken Covishield. On May 13, the government increased interval between two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks.
NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Government has also made changes in Co-Win application. Now, whether it is HCWs or frontline workers (FLWs) or other citizens, they will become eligible for second dose of Covishield only after 12 weeks of first dose.”
Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar said, “It is painful to hear 49,390 HCWs did not take their second dose within prescribed maximum limit. Many HCWs, especially contractual employees, did not take vaccine as vaccination was interrupted in private hospitals from May 1. Eligible HCWs should have availed the opportunity when they were given first preference. Many HCWs were waiting as they were wary of queues at government centers and also aware that maximum gap between two doses is helpful.”
The government had started inoculation of FLWs from February 5. By March 21, 1,24,972 FLWs had taken the jab. As on May 16, 1,25,748 had taken second dose, which is more than those that had taken first dose on March 21. This means all availed second dose well before maximum interval.
The government had commenced vaccination of 60+ and 45+ with comorbidities on March 1. In this category, 1,75,804 citizens had taken first dose by March 21 of which 1,73,650 availed second dose by May 16. Only 2,154 beneficiaries are yet to take second dose. Some had contracted the disease in second wave, and will become eligible for second dose after 40-45 days from day of testing positive.
With implementation of new interval between two doses of Covishield, number of vaccinations has dropped to a great extent in the city. After receiving doses, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had resumed second dose on May 13 and 14,519 took the jab. The number of beneficiaries declined to 9,548 on May 14 with implementation of new guidelines.
Then, the civic body resumed first dose of 45+ people to see rise in numbers to 14,468 on May 15. Number declined to 5,697 on May 16 and 4,888 on May 17.
NMC on Monday announced starting of inoculation of 45+ at two Drive-In Vaccination Centres. Earlier, only above 60 years were allowed but few from 45-59 years age group had availed it. NMC also announced continuation of inoculation on Tuesday. The government is likely to deliver fresh stock of doses on Tuesday.

Assam: Co-WIN 'glitches' vex 18-plus in search for jab slots,2987,"GUWAHATI: After health minister Keshab Mahanta tweeted that Assam has 3.65 lakh Covid-19 vaccines in stock, 1.49 lakh for the 45+ and 2.16 lakh for the 18 to 44 year category, the young generation was left confused about the purpose of creating a vaccine bank when the need of the hour was urgent inoculation given the steady rise in the number of cases.
“I have been trying for a slot for the last five-six days but have not got any. I found 200 slots in my location in Guwahati on Sunday but all slots vanished within seconds of clicking on the select button. This is happening with many of my friends,” said Braja Thakuria, a youth, who registered his name on Co-WIN on May 3.

Thousands of people in the 18-44 age group across rural and urban Assam are searching for slots on smartphones. Even more helpless are people from underprivileged backgrounds, who do not have smartphones or are not familiar with Co-WIN. Leading student-youth organizations as well as the Assam chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have raised serious concerns over the population, which still does not have access to digital gadgets to register their names on Co-WIN.
""Healthcare should be universal and the vaccination process should have been simplified. Will the illiterate people be left out of the vaccination drive if they do not register their names in Co-WIN?"" wondered Dr Satyajit Borah, president, IMA’s Assam state branch.

The All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) have decided to help the needy to register their names on the Co-WIN platform.
Aasu general secretary Sankar Jyoti Baruah said, “There seems to be a large scarcity of vaccines for the 18+ age group. But it was not so for the 45+ category. Despite having several vaccination centres in districts, the 18-44 age group people are being vaccinated only in a few centres, and that too through a complicated process.”
The central leadership of Aasu has already appealed to its district, sub-divisional and local committees to extend support to the 18+ people who have not been able to register themselves and are desperately searching for slots amid an alarming Covid situation that has led the state government to impose new restrictions.
Contrary to the allegations by various groups, a health department spokesperson said that about 10,000 people in the 18+ category are being inoculated everyday in greater Guwahati, while in other districts 2,000-6,000 vaccinations are being done on an average. ""There are 260 vaccination centres for the 18+ that are being operated in Assam, whereas for the 45+ category the number varies from 900-1,400, depending on the availability. We are soon going to increase the number of vaccination centres for the 18+ but waiting for a bigger consignment,"" said immunization spokesperson and director of health services (family welfare), Assam, Munindra Nath Ngatey.

"Madhya Pradesh: Scammers targeting Bhopal healthcare institutions, Cyber HQ issues advisory",1709,"BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh state cyber cell headquarters have issued a fresh advisory that the scammers are targeting health care institutions impersonating as army personnel and requesting for medical tests of their family members.
In lieu of advance payment for the tests, money is transferred from your account by cyber criminals. Officers have already received a couple of complaints in the last one week, one is from a prominent hospital of the city.
As per the advisory, the scammers impersonate as army personnel while contacting hospitals, doctors and pathologies, requesting an advance booking for Covid-19 and other relevant tests for their family members on grounds that they are posted at a distant place.
For the advance payment of the tests, they ask for your payment wallet number on PhonePE, Google Pay or PayTM and total amount to be paid for all the tests through WhatsApp.

“In the name of verification of their account, the fraudster asks you to make transfer of Rs 5 to 10 to their account and immediately return the amount to your account to gain your trust,” advisory says.
As soon as you are convinced, the fraudsters send you a reverse request of the said amount on digital payment applications and request you to follow their instructions in order to receive the payment.
“Citing the army's rules, they ask you to perform the process quickly. As soon as you click on the request and enter the UPI PIN, the said amount gets withdrawn from your account instead. This type of modus operandi has been attempted with two reputed hospitals of Bhopal. Similar crimes can also be attempted against service providers like chartered accountants, lawyer, medical practitioners etc,” say officials.

Cricket scorer arranges Rs 50 lakh insurance amount for ward boy's family at Bombay hospital,1690,"MUMBAI: For a change, a cricket scorer has 'scored a ton' in another field.
In a laudable initiative, a cricket scorer who works at the Bombay Hospital has managed to arrange Rs 50 lakh insurance amount for the family of a ward boy who used to work in its X-ray department before he expired last year due to Covid-19, under the Pradhan Mantri Garin Kalyan package scheme for healthcare workers fighting the deadly virus.

Dhananjay used to help technicians take X-Rays of covid patients, before passing away on May 27 last year at the age of 54 due to covid. Last week, On May 6, Jayashri Gogar, the wife of Dhananjay Laya Gogar, received an amount of Rs 50 lakh from New India Assurance via NEFT to her account, thanks largely due to the efforts of Deepak Joshi, a well-known BCCI and Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) cricket scorer who worked with him as a technician in the Bombay Hospital's X-ray department.
""I worked with him in the X-ray department for four years. He was survived by his wife and a daughter, who studies in the ninth standard in school. Realising that they would need financial help on an urgent basis, and that can be done through the Prime Minister's fund for healthcare workers, I approached New India assurance and the health ministry for details. They asked for some documents of the case, which I submitted with the help of the human resources and medical department of the Bombay Hospital. In March, I got a call and an email from the PM healthcare department, and last week, I got a call and an email from New India Assurance. Last Friday, they transferred Rs 50 lakh to his wife's account in Bank of India (BOI), Wadala Branch,"" Joshi told TOI on Saturday.

"Goa: Lowest daily count in last 2 weeks, recovery rate improves",2608,"PANAJI: For a third consecutive day, Goa reported a dip in Covid-19 cases. On Saturday, it reported 1,957 cases, the lowest daily count in the last two weeks. Goa has now over 30,000 active cases. The fatality count rose to 2,057 with 58 deaths.
The state registered a marginal improvement in the recovery rate that rose to 76% as 3,512 people were cured.

Of 58 deaths recorded on Saturday, 33 died at Goa Medical College (GMC).
Following a meeting with an expert team of doctors, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the Goa government is working on additional treatment protocols that have been followed by the Karnataka government.

Under the guidance of Dr Anoop Amarnath, the member of State’s critical care support team, the usage of Baricitinib for treatment of covid patients has been approved. “It is to be administered orally from the fifth day of symptoms along with Remdesivir. It has prevented patients from reaching the breathlessness stage, and proven effective in preventing a Cytokine storm,” said Rane.
Goa Medical College dean Dr S M Bandekar said Karnataka has found that oxygen consumption among Covid-19 patients is very high due to the “double mutant” strain detected in the second wave.
“That’s why they have changed their protocol and added Baricitinib to their treatment protocol,” Bandekar said.
The drugs work fantastic in reducing Cytokine storms and lungs are protected. “It has been decided to use this protocol for patients here so that their oxygen requirement will be less, lungs protected and they will be cured faster,” he said.
A cryogenic tank of 20,000-kilo liters that would provide oxygen to GMC was commissioned on Saturday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said it is the third such tank installed in the state. “It was shifted in three days and commissioned,” Sawant told reporters.
The arrangement would do away with GMC’s reliance on oxygen supplied through trolleys, to meet a multi-fold rise in consumption of oxygen due to the huge rise in Covid cases requiring hospital admissions.
Maharashtra has also come to the rescue of Goa and Kerala during their oxygen crisis. In the wake of an urgent message from the Centre, Maharashtra has provided two oxygen tankers each to both states. Maharashtra has a total of 323 tankers for transportation of oxygen. “We have supplied 18 MT oxygen to Goa, while two empty tankers, with a total capacity of 28.5 MTs, have been given to Kerala for transportation of oxygen. For Goa, it is only one-time supply of oxygen, while our empty tankers will remain with these states,” a senior bureaucrat from Maharashtra told TOI.

"Curbs necessary to break virus chain, say experts",2501,"KOLKATA: Doctors and health experts appealed to citizens to make a small sacrifice by staying indoors and adhering to restrictions, announced by the government on Saturday to stave off the healthcare crisis that the state currently confronts.
“Please stay at home. Do not step out unless it is a life and death situation. This is a life and death situation right now. It is imperative that everyone understands the gravity and stays home. If you absolutely must step out, wear a proper mask in the proper way and maintain physical distancing. Only if we are able to manage these restrictions on movement of people will we be able to emerge from this crisis,” said pulmonologist Sivaresmi Unnithan.

While the restrictions will not reduce infectivity, it is aimed at breaking the chain of infection and slow down the active case load that has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure. Hospital beds and ICUs are full, oxygen cylinders aren’t available in the market, medicines are out of stock, and doctors and nurses are fatigued. Though the government and private hospitals have been constantly ramping up bed capacity for three weeks now, the sharp rise in case load has meant that additional beds have got filled up in no time.
“This is the only way to temporarily break the chain and give relief to the healthcare sector that is completely saturated. Usually, such restrictions happen in blocks of two weeks because that is the period by which an infected person will either recover or go into ventilation. If we can stop the infected people from mixing with others, the chain will be broken. New infections will decline and fewer hospitalisations will be required,” explained surgery professor Diptendra Sarkar who is part of the SSKM hospital’s Covid management team.

A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had revealed that one person can infect 400 persons in a month. By introducing curbs for a fortnight, the number of infections can be half or 200. While such restrictions can break the chain, internal medicine consultant Sibabrata Banerjee acknowledged it is a double edged sword as it could also drive the poor to desperation and absolute disregard for health and safety.
“Community medicine does not support very stringent restrictions because they hurt the poor and drive them to further poverty. So it is a delicate balance between life and livelihood. We have reached such a point in this pandemic that this unfortunate measure is necessary,” Banerjee explained.

Goa: ‘Government should take over private hospitals’,1661,"PANAJI: With Goa Medical College (GMC) being overburdened with Covid patients, the BJP core committee on Friday urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to take over private hospitals to increase bed capacity.
A senior core committee member said that the decision to take over private hospitals for Covid patients is left up to the government.

No compatible source was found for this media.

The BJP core committee had a nearly two-hour-long discussion on Covid management.
Sawant said that he has briefed the core committee about the steps taken by the state government over Covid management.

The senior member said that it has come to the notice of BJP that private hospitals treat Covid patients in the initial stage and shift them to GMC when they turn critical, which places an additional load on the hospital’s infrastructure.
Another senior core committee member said that as per government information, GMC is a 250-bed hospital, but has more than 600 Covid patients admitted.
Another senior member said that if, in Mumbai, a single order by the municipal commissioner allowed the state to take over all private hospitals to treat Covid patients, why then could the Goa government not do the same. “They will get an additional around 400 beds,” the member said.
The state government can pay the doctors as per the fees prescribed by the Centre for treating Covid patients, the member added.
The core committee also requested the CM to speed up the vaccination drive in the state. Core committee also requested the chief minister to speed testing and results. As of now at least three days are required to get the covid test report.

"Goa: Stop feud, resolve oxygen issue, says Congress",1260,"PANAJI: Instead of fighting among themselves, chief minister Pramod Sawant should call an emergency all-party meeting to find solutions and resolve the problem of irregular oxygen supply, beds, ventilators and vaccinations at the earliest, said Congress mahila president Beena Naik on Friday.
Naik criticised the BJP government for passing the buck to each other’s departments. “In reality there are no medicines, no vaccinations and no discipline among BJP leaders,” she said.

“I want to ask BJP government if they intend to print Modi’s picture on the death certificate of persons who died due to Covid-19,” she said.
Naik said that it is “disheartening” to hear that between 2am to 6am there have been 62 deaths in three days.

Congress also said that it is shameful that the state can provide hundreds of trucks with drivers to supply coal to the neighbouring Karnataka but cannot manage to supply few trolleys and drivers to supply oxygen cylinders to hospitals in the state.
“Is it because you are not going to get any revenue through the supply of oxygen that you have neglected it? It’s ridiculous and a total failure and mismanagement of the government,” said Naik.
Naik said that Goans are getting ready to defeat not just Covid-19 but the BJP too.

Odisha: Doctors demand priority vaccine for family members,1888,"BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha Medical Services Association (OMSA) on Friday urged the state government to give vaccines to family members of healthcare providers, including doctors, on a priority basis.
In a letter to Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health), OMSA has expressed unhappiness for not adding family members of healthcare workers in the priority vaccination programme.

“Doctors and healthcare providers have been fighting this Covid-19 pandemic for a year and a half. Their family members are also getting exposed to the virus. Some family members of healthcare workers have died of Covid-19 as well. But the family members are yet to be considered for vaccination on priority basis,” said Narayana Rout, president of OMSA.
He said family members of doctors and other healthcare workers are living in a state of fear as their kin have been treating Covid patients. “To boost their morale and protect them, the government should vaccinate the family members on a priority basis,” Rout added.

The association members said the government has allowed priority vaccination for people of some professions. “The healthcare providers, including doctors, are dissatisfied with this discrimination to frontline Covid workers,” the association letter read.
The resident doctors’ association, Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (Vimsar), Burla, has also requested the government to vaccinate family members of healthcare workers. In a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the resident doctors have requested him to allocate special session for first degree relatives of healthcare workers to boost their moral and spirit.
“Healthcare workers are exhausted fighting against Covid-19. Their family members are significantly at higher risk to Covid infection than general people,” said the resident doctors’ association in the memorandum.

Kerala: Hospitals seek clarity on treatment cost,2909,"KOCHI: Private hospitals have alleged that lack of clarity in the government order fixing Covid treatment rates for walkin patients in private hospitals has led to increased incidents of conflict between patients’ relatives and hospital administration. Meanwhile, several medical insurance companies have also informed private hospitals that they will only pay as per government treatment rates.
Upset with this, private hospitals managements — Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter) and Kerala Private Hospital Association (KPHA)—have written to the state government seeking early intervention by bringing in more clarity in the order issued on May 10, “lest private hospitals which are even otherwise stressed turn into battle grounds”.

KPHA in their letter to the government has asked clarity on three key issues — private rooms and suite rent, treatment cost of those covered by insurance and treatment of patients with comorbidities.
“The government in the order is only talking about patients admitted to wards. But what about those who are admitted to private rooms or suites? They should be excluded from the package. Patients who can afford comfort and highend treatment should be allowed the same,” said KPHA secretary Dr Benevan Joseph.

Further, KPHA has asked to exempt patients insured with private insurance agencies since they are fully covered by insurance on cashless payment. “With the government order not mentioning exclusion of insurance, the companies are refusing to pay hospitals prefixed contract rates. This adds to the financial stress of healthcare institutions,” the letter said.
“It is a known fact that hospitals will not be able to provide free treatment for pre-existing comorbidities under the package rates fixed for Covid treatment. It is kindly requested that the same may be explicitly mentioned in the government order,” the letter added.
Private hospital managements alleged that due to lack of clarity, though patients agree to high end initially, at the time of payment of bill they refuse stating that the hospital is overcharging. “Healthcare is complex and lot of clarity is required in many areas. We are waiting for more clarity from the government, otherwise service of quality will be affected,” said Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter) president Dr M I Sahadulla.
“Added with this, the government toll-free number operator advises patients and bystanders that, “If the hospital charges a patient for anything more than the two investigations and medicines, kindly inform the authorities and action will be taken against the hospital,” added Dr Joseph.
“We are really saddened by the developments. Lack of clarity in the government order has led to increased conflict between patient and hospital administration. How can we treat Covid patients under such circumstances?” asked Kerala IMA secretary Dr Gopikumar P.

Covishield interval increase to help 45+ group get 1st shot,3081,"PUNE: The increase in the interval between two Covishield doses to 12-16 weeks is likely to work to the advantage of beneficiaries aged 45 years and above currently scrambling to get their first shots, state public health authorities told TOI on Friday.
Since the citizens, whose Covishield inoculation began from March, will now be due for the second shot only around May last week or later, the (Covishield) first doses would be more readily available for the 45+ category till then, officials said.


The state has been giving preference to those due for second doses following the shortage of vaccines. But as the number of beneficiaries who were earlier due for Covishield second doses has now decreased because of the change in guidelines, this would automatically mean that the first-time beneficiaries could access more Covishield doses that are at the state’s disposal, an official said.

This only applies to Covishield, as there is no change in the interval of Covaxin vaccine doses.
The officials also said it would now not be possible for citizens (who had received the Covishield first shot) to avail of online appointments or onsite walk-ins before they complete 84 days (12 weeks) after their first dose. However, those who have already booked appointments for the second doses will be given the shots even if the Covishield two-dose interval is less than 84 days. “Suitable changes on Co-WIN are being made,” an official said.
“Vaccination for citizens above the age of 45 years (60+ and 45+ with comorbidities) was started from March 1. They would be due for the second doses from May last week as per the revised guidelines. Healthcare and frontline workers who were inoculated during the earlier phases of the drive will primarily be eligible to receive the second Covishield shots during the ongoing period, provided they have completed 84 days (12 weeks) after the first dose,” said Dr Archana Patil, director (family welfare), directorate of health services.
She added that this effectively meant that once the healthcare and frontline workers, and those with confirmed appointments till now, got their second shots, the remaining quota would be used for those who want first doses among the 45+ age group. “This naturally means that those seeking first doses will now have more vaccine availability,” said Dr Patil.
Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Till Friday, confirmed appointments and walk-ins of Covishield beneficiaries seeking second shots (as per the earlier due date) were being honoured. But this system will stop from Saturday, when only those who have completed 12 weeks or more can get the Covishield second shots. This will automatically lead to exclusion of 3/4th of beneficiaries from the ongoing vaccination drive, as their due date has shifted to May last week or beyond.”
Suitable changes were being made on Co-WIN reflecting the increase in the minimum period between first and second dose of Covishield from the earlier 42 days to 84 days. These changes were made effective from midnight of May 14.

"Ficci West Bengal, GE Healthcare to unveil Covid bridge course",1654,"Kolkata: Ficci West Bengal has tied up with multinational healthcare giant GE Healthcare for a bridge course in Covid-19 management.
The course aims to teach paramedical staff and nurses the essential skills of managing a Covid patient. This includes adequate oxygen therapy, pharmacology of drugs used in Covid management, categories of Covid and AIIMS treatment protocol, basics of mechanical ventilation, post-Covid complications and recovery, mucormycosis etc. The apex industry body is also in discussion with industries for setting up oxygen plants.

Rudra Chatterjee, chairman, Ficci West Bengal, said that this tie-up would immensely benefit health workers to counter the killer virus. He has also called on industry and Ficci members to come forward and extend all help necessary. “Ensuring staff are trained in Covid-compliant behaviour, donating oxygen concentrators, buying and distributing reusable masks are some options. Ficci will continue reaching out to the state government and stands ready to extend any help necessary,” he added.
According to Chatterjee, interventions of Ficci in West Bengal to combat Covid-19 includes assistance to members and to support government. The Ficci state office has been interacting with their members regularly to share updates on orders and notifications by the Government of West Bengal as well as sharing advisory on current status on impact of Covid.

Aggregation of data on requirement of vaccines from members for their employees and families are being done. “ Our members like Neotia Group, ITC, Luxmi Tea, Dhunseri have come forward to donate concentrators to the state government,” he added.

Maharashtra: Healthcare & frontline workers due for 2nd dose to get priority,2168,"MUMBAI: In the wake of the Centre’s decision to extend dosage interval of Covishield, the state’s immunisation in-charge Dr Dilip Patil said a meeting has been called with all district officials on Saturday to gauge their stock positions.
“We are willing to give the first dose to 45+, but before that we will have to prioritise healthcare and frontline workers who qualify for the second dose. Only 60%-65% from these two categories have taken the second dose,” he said. He added the state had 5-6-lakh doses of Covishield to sustain vaccination for 3 days.

Numbers show 11.3 lakh healthcare workers have taken the first dose, while a little over 6.89 lakh have taken the second in the state. Similarly, 15.51 lakh frontline workers have taken the first dose and 6.8 lakh have taken both. The drive for healthcare workers had started on January 16 while that for frontline workers had started on February 3. He said a decision will be taken after Saturday’s meeting.
For Covaxin though, priority will be given to those waiting for a second dose as their interval remains unchanged at 28 days-42 days. The state has received 1.13 lakh doses of Covaxin on Friday, which will be mainly used for second doses.

Immunisation officials had to return to their drawing boards. Mumbai, for instance, had called off the vaccination drive on Saturday and Sunday to conserve doses for three days of walk-ins from Monday. Officials said the walk-in plan is likely to remain unchanged for Covaxin seekers on Monday.
AMC Suresh Kakani said they would also rejig their plans for next week. “Because of the new rule, we suddenly have few people eligible for a second shot from more than a lakh. The walk-in planned for Covaxin and those who qualify for Covishield (if they have completed 84 days) will most likely go on, but we will take some decisions on Saturday,” he said.
Executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the city has 50,000 to 60,000 doses. “We may consider giving the first doses depending on what the state decides,” she said. She added around 10,000 to 15,000 frontliners are waiting for their second dose. On Friday, 23,924 people got vaccinated in the city.

Compensate kin of Covid victims: Kamat,968,"Margao: Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat has demanded compensation for the kin of those who died of Covid, and that a judicial probe be conducted on Covid deaths.
“As the government has clearly admitted now that deaths in GMC occurred due to gross negligence. Chief minister Pramod Sawant must own the responsibility and immediately announce substantial compensation to the families of those patients who were murdered by government apathy and blunder,” he said.

Questioning the government’s failure in fixing responsibility for 74 deaths in GMC in last four days due to oxygen shortage, Kamat said he was exploring legal options for demanding judicial Inquiry into the Covid deaths.
“A judicial inquiry is a must to probe the entire handling of the Covid pandemic by the government. People want to know what is the actual reason for a sudden rise in Covid deaths in Goa. Prepare a audit report from a team of experts adopting scientific methodology,” Kamat said.

Citizens irked over refusal to dispose off Covid bodies,2876,"Margao: Refusal to allow cremation/burial of bodies of Covid-19 victims by the management committees of some crematoriums and burial grounds has irked conscientious citizens.
Dr Anthony Rodrigues, who had petitioned the Goa Human Rights Commission in 2012 over a similar issue, said such instances were in violation of the commission’s ruling delivered in November 2017. “Disposal of bodies is the responsibility of the state. The Goa Municipalities Act and the Goa Panchayat Raj Act mandates that local bodies take responsibility of disposal of the bodies. Moreover, there should be no discrimination over their faith,” Rodrigues said.

Referring to the GHRC’s order, in a recent letter, the department of urban development has directed all municipalities “to take appropriate steps” to provide burial grounds and crematoriums in all municipal areas.
The department’s additional director, Clen Madeira, in the same letter, has ordered municiplaities “to take urgent steps to ensure that burial grounds are made available to all persons in your respective municipal areas.”

“We recommend that the director of municipal administration and the director of panchayats shall take urgent steps to ensure that crematorium grounds and burial grounds are made available to all persons in the respective municipal areas and village panchayat areas so that the basic human rights of all persons are protected,” the GHRC had said while disposing the petition.
The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) had then told the GHRC of how its plans of providing burial space for persons professing different faiths were scuttled owing to the delay in the proposed kabrastan at Sonsoddo. The MMC had pointed out that “within this land that was supposed to be developed for the purpose of kabrastan, a part of it was reserved as a burial ground for such persons who were from different faiths.”
“(The) Council has all good intentions to comply with the directions of the GHRC and the moment the work of kabrastan is taken up, adequate care would be taken to ensure that a decent burial ground, having an area of 1,000 sqm is also developed by us,” the action taken report of MMC filed before GHRC had stated.
The situation has since remained unchanged. The MMC acquired 31,000 sqm of land at Sonsoddo for a kabrastan in May 2011. Though the work of construction of the kabrastan was sanctioned by the state government in November 2011 at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore, for various reasons the work never took off.
Nevertheless, the Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha, Margao, which manages the Hindu crematorium at Pajifond, Margao, has come to the aid of the authorities by making available several pyres for cremating bodies of Covid victims, which take place between 5pm and 6 pm. Cremation of unclaimed bodies, which is undertaken by the Margao municipality, also takes place at the Pajifond crematorium.

Fastest fingers first as vaccine slots for 18+ fill up in minutes on Friday,2693,"Panaji: Many eager citizens aged between 18 and 44 were left disappointed on Friday after they failed to get a vaccination slot. While a very few tasted success in registering for slots, many found that booking a slot was akin to buying tatkal tickets.
Within minutes of vaccination slots being opened for those between 18 to 44 years of age, all the available slots for four days were booked. While tech-savvy users used multiple devices and also relied on bots for notifications about slots, other quick-thinking users were willing to go the extra mile to get vaccinated, opting for rural locations despite residing in the state capital.

“400 vaccine slots for 18+ in Goa gone in less than two minutes,” said Shannon. “Is anyone actually able to book an appointment or are these slots just for show? I kept getting a ‘wrong security code’ message until it said that all the slots have been booked for that date.”
Goa is all set to launch the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for people in the age group 18-45 years from May 15. Citizens were urged to register themselves on the CoWin portal starting at 12pm.

“I was excited but when I was checking for the slots it kept showing booked. In Margao they were showing booked so I was trying other places in South Goa. When I tried to register it would not allow me to enter the captcha and then it would crash,” said Margao resident Vinda Kare.
Frustrated with her experience, Kare asked her friend to try for a slot. “He booked a slot for me in Ponda but I could not even see the slots in Ponda on my computer,” Kare, who got a slot for Sunday, said.
Many who tried to book vaccination slots at a private hospital at Dona Paula have faced similar problems with slots getting taken within five minutes.
Where Kare succeeded many others were left desperately searching.
“It was... a rollercoaster,” a 33-year-old told TOI when asked about his meticulous search to find a slot on the portal. “I tried for one and a half hours. It showed unavailable and then immediately booked. No middle ground.”
Commander (rtd) Abhilash Tomy, who circumnavigated the earth non-stop, had his own disappointment. “Vaccine slots for 18+ opened today for Goa. For two minute,” said Tomy in a tweet. “Five days slots gone in two minutes. fastest fingers, fast internet didn’t work. Happy to say I got nine OTPs.”
Some residents of Margao, Mapusa and Panaji searched for rural vaccination locations such as Aldona, Corlim, Cuncolim, Mandur and others on the assumption that the urban centres would be in high demand.
The tech savvy relied on platforms and automated bots which send alerts whenever a vaccine slot becomes available using the public API.

Odisha: Doctors seek priority vaccination for family members,2065,"BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha Medical Services Association (OMSA) on Friday urged the state government to give an order for special provision of vaccination to family members of all healthcare providers including doctors.
In a letter to Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health), OMSA has expressed unhappiness for not adding family members of healthcare workers in priority vaccination programmes.

“Doctors and healthcare providers have been fighting this Covid-19 pandemic during the last one and a half years. Their family members are also getting exposed to Covid with the same frequency. Even some family members of healthcare workers have died of Covid-19. But the family members are yet to be considered to receive vaccines on priority basis,” said Narayana Rout, president of OMSA.
He said family members of the doctors and other healthcare workers are living in a state of fear as their kin work in hospitals to treat Covid patients. To strengthen their morale and protect them, the government should vaccinate the family members on a priority basis immediately,” said Rout.

The association members said the government has given special provision to the people from some professions to get vaccines. “All healthcare providers including doctors are very much dissatisfied with this discrimination to frontline Covid workers,” said the association letter to the health department.
Similarly, the Resident Doctors' Association, Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, has also requested the government to vaccinate family members of healthcare workers.
In a memorandum to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the resident doctors have requested him to allocate special sessions for the first degree relatives of healthcare workers to boost their morale and spirit.
“Healthcare workers are busy and exhausted in hospitals while fighting against the Covid-19. Their family members are significantly at higher risk to Covid infection than general people,” said the resident doctor’s association in the memorandum.

Goa: Valpoi separates testing facility from vaccine centre,1625,"VALPOI: To separate the crowds of people getting vaccinated from the hordes queuing up to get tested at the Valpoi Community Health Centre, the vaccination centre has been moved to Kadamba bus stand hall, Velus, from Thursday onwards.
“As per the order of the Disaster Management Authority, Kadamba bus stand hall has been handed over to Sattari disaster management cell to set up a vaccination centre. This setup has been made for 45+ age group and the services has been started from Thursday. The vaccination for 18-45 age groups will be started at the same Kadamba hall when the vaccine stock arrives,” said Sattari mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas.

Gawas added that the vaccination will take place at Kadamba hall which is very wide and has enough ventilation.
He said that since a large number of people come for Covid testing as well as for vaccination at Valpoi CHC, controlling the crowd and the spread of the virus is difficult. Now people need not have to worry as the new premises at Kadamba is independently for vaccination services and CHC premises will continue to be used for Covid testing.

Many people put off taking the vaccine as they fear they may contract the virus while waiting with those come for testing under the same roof.
These days Valpoi CHC has witnessed a surge in Covid testing and people have to wait for hours in a queue. Few patients were also seen fainting. The wait is especially hard on senior citizens.
“Now we hope that there won’t be any fear for those who come to get vaccinated as the government has made an appropriate decision to shift the vaccination centre,” a Valpoi resident said.
