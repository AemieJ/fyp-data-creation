COVID-19's Third Surge Is Breaking Health-Care Workers - The Atlantic,17465,"On Saturday morning, Megan Ranney was about to put on her scrubs when she heard that Joe Biden had won the presidential election. That day, she treated people with COVID-19 while street parties erupted around the country. She was still in the ER in the late evening when Biden and Vice President–elect Kamala Harris made their victory speeches. These days, her shifts at Rhode Island Hospital are long, and they “are not going to change in the next 73 days,” before Biden becomes president, she told me on Monday. Every time Ranney returns to the hospital, there are more COVID-19 patients. In the months since March, many Americans have habituated to the horrors of the pandemic. They process the election’s ramifications. They plan for the holidays. But health-care workers do not have the luxury of looking away: They’re facing a third pandemic surge that is bigger and broader than the previous two. In the U.S., states now report more people in the hospital with COVID-19 than at any other point this year—and 40 percent more than just two weeks ago. Emergency rooms are starting to fill again with COVID-19 patients. Utah, where Nathan Hatton is a pulmonary specialist at the University of Utah Hospital, is currently reporting 2,500 confirmed cases a day, roughly four times its summer peak. Hatton says that his intensive-care unit is housing twice as many patients as it normally does. His shifts usually last 12 to 24 hours, but can stretch to 36. “There are times I’ll come in in the morning, see patients, work that night, work all the next day, and then go home,” he told me. I asked him how many such shifts he has had to do. “Too many,” he said. Hospitals have put their pandemic plans into action, adding more beds and creating makeshift COVID-19 wards. But in the hardest-hit areas, there are simply not enough doctors, nurses, and other specialists to staff those beds. Some health-care workers told me that COVID-19 patients are the sickest people they’ve ever cared for: They require twice as much attention as a typical intensive-care-unit patient, for three times the normal length of stay. “It was doable over the summer, but now it’s just too much,” says Whitney Neville, a nurse based in Iowa. “Last Monday we had 25 patients waiting in the emergency department. They had been admitted but there was no one to take care of them.” I asked her how much slack the system has left. “There is none,” she said. Read: America is trapped in a pandemic spiral The entire state of Iowa is now out of staffed beds, Eli Perencevich, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Iowa, told me. Worse is coming. Iowa is accumulating more than 3,600 confirmed cases every day; relative to its population, that’s more than twice the rate Arizona experienced during its summer peak, “when their system was near collapse,” Perencevich said. With only lax policies in place, those cases will continue to rise. Hospitalizations lag behind cases by about two weeks; by Thanksgiving, today’s soaring cases will be overwhelming hospitals that already cannot cope. “The wave hasn’t even crashed down on us yet,” Perencevich said. “It keeps rising and rising, and we’re all running on fear. The health-care system in Iowa is going to collapse, no question.” In the imminent future, patients will start to die because there simply aren’t enough people to care for them. Doctors and nurses will burn out. The most precious resource the U.S. health-care system has in the struggle against COVID-19 isn’t some miracle drug. It’s the expertise of its health-care workers—and they are exhausted. The struggles of the first two COVID-19 surges in the United States helped hospitals steel themselves for the third. Hardened by the crucible of March and April, New York City built up its ability to spot burgeoning hot spots, trace contacts, and offer places where infected people can isolate. “We’re seeing red flags but we’ve prepared ourselves,” says Syra Madad from NYC Health + Hospitals. Experienced health-care workers are less fearful than they were earlier this year. “We’ve been through this before and we know what we have to do,” says Uché Blackstock, an emergency physician who works in Brooklyn. And with the new generation of rapid tests, Blackstock says she can now tell patients if they have the coronavirus within minutes—a huge improvement over the spring, when tests were scarce and slow. Smaller clinics, nursing homes, and long-term-care facilities are still struggling to provide personal protective equipment, including gloves and masks. “About a third are completely out of at least one type of PPE” despite having COVID-19 cases, says Esther Choo, a physician at Oregon Health and Science University and a founder of Get Us PPE. But larger hospitals are doing better, having built up stockpiles and backup plans in case supply chains become strained again. “The hospital is probably the safest place to work in Iowa, because we actually have PPE,” Perencevich said. Most important, COVID-19 is no longer a total mystery. Health-care workers now have a clearer idea of what the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is capable of. Protocols that didn’t exist in the spring have become habit. “It used to be that to do a single thing, people would start email chains and you’d be 100 emails in before we knew the answer,” Choo says. “Now we’re moving faster. It feels a lot more confident.” Read: The difference between feeling safe and being safe There are still no cures, and the best drug on offer—the steroid dexamethasone—reduces the odds of dying from COVID-19 by at most 12 percent. But doctors know how to triage patients, which tests to order, and which treatments to use. They know that ventilators can sometimes hurt patients, and that “proning”—flipping patients onto their stomach—can help. They know about the blood clots and kidney problems. They know that hydroxychloroquine doesn’t work. This cumulative knowledge means that death rates from COVID-19 are much lower now than they were in the spring. Flattening the curve worked as intended, giving health-care workers some breathing room to learn how to handle a disease that didn’t even exist this time last year. But these hard-earned successes are brittle. If death rates have fallen thanks to increasing medical savvy, they might rise again as nurses and doctors burn out. “If we can get patients into staffed beds, I feel like they’re doing better,” Perencevich said. “But that requires a functional health-care system, and we’re at the point where we aren’t going to have that.” Intensive-care units are called that for a reason. A typical patient with a severe case of COVID-19 will have a tube connecting their airways to a ventilator, which must be monitored by a respiratory therapist. If their kidneys shut down, they might be on 24-hour dialysis. Every day, they’ll need to be flipped onto their stomach, and then onto their back again—a process that requires six or seven people. They’ll have several tubes going into their heart and blood vessels, administering eight to 12 drugs—sedatives, pain medications, blood thinners, antibiotics, and more. All of these must be carefully adjusted, sometimes minute to minute, by an ICU nurse. None of these drugs is for treating COVID-19 itself. “That’s just to keep them alive,” Neville, the Iowa nurse, said. An ICU nurse can typically care for two people at a time, but a single COVID-19 patient can consume their full attention. Those patients remain in the ICU for three times the length of the usual stay. Nurses and doctors are also falling sick themselves. “The winter is traditionally a very stressful time in health care, and everyone gets taken down at some point,” says Saskia Popescu, an infection preventionist at George Mason University, who is based in Arizona. The third COVID-19 surge has intensified this seasonal cycle, as health-care workers catch the virus, often from outside the hospital. “Our unplanned time off is double what it was last October,” says Allison Suttle of Sanford Health, a health system operating in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. Many hospitals have staff on triple backup: While off their shifts, they should expect to get called in if a colleague and their first substitute and the substitute’s substitute are all sick. At least 1,375 U.S. health-care workers have died from COVID-19. The first two surges were concentrated in specific parts of the country, so beleaguered hospitals could call for help from states that weren’t besieged. “People were coming to us in our hour of need,” says Madad, from NYC Health + Hospitals, “but now the entire nation is on fire.” No one has reinforcements to send. There are travel nurses who aren’t tied to specific health systems, but the hardest-hit rural hospitals are struggling to attract them away from wealthier, urban centers. “Everyone is tapping into the same pool, and people don’t want to work in Fargo, North Dakota, for the holidays,” Suttle says. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum recently said that nurses who are positive for COVID-19 but symptom-free can return to work in COVID-19 units. “That’s just a big red flag of just how serious it is,” Suttle says. (The North Dakota Nurses Association has rejected the policy.) Read: This overlooked variable is key to the pandemic Short-staffed hospitals could transfer their patients—but to where? “A lot of smaller hospitals don’t have ventilators or staff trained to take care of someone in critical condition,” says Renae Moch, the director of Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, North Dakota. “They’re looking to larger hospitals,” but those are also full. Making matters worse, patients with other medical problems are sicker than usual, several doctors told me. During the earlier surges, hospitals canceled elective surgeries and pulled in doctors from outpatient clinics. People with heart problems, cancers, strokes, and other diseases found it harder to get medical help, and some sat on their illness for fear of contracting COVID-19 at the hospital. Now health-care workers are facing an influx of unusually sick people at a time when COVID-19 has consumed their attention and their facilities. “We’re still catching up on all of that,” says Choo, the Oregon physician. “Even the simplest patients aren’t simple.” For many health-care workers, the toll of the pandemic goes beyond physical exhaustion. COVID-19 has eaten away at the emotional core of their work. “To be a nurse, you really have to care about people,” Neville said. But when an ICU is packed with COVID-19 patients, most of whom are likely to die, “to protect yourself, you just shut down. You get to the point when you realize that you’ve become a machine. There’s only so many bags you can zip.” As the pandemic moved out of big coastal cities and into rural communities, health-care workers were more likely to treat people they knew personally—relatives, hospital colleagues, the bus driver who drove their kids to school. And across the country, doctors and nurses have struggled with the same anxieties as everyone else—loneliness, extra child-care burdens, the stress of a tumultuous year, fear. “The lines between our personal lives and our careers have completely gone,” says Laolu Fayanju, senior medical director in Ohio of Oak Street Health, a national network of primary-care centers. “We’re often thinking about how we protect ourselves, our families, and our neighborhoods” from the pandemic. After SARS hit Toronto in 2003, health-care workers at hospitals that treated SARS patients showed higher levels of burnout and posttraumatic stress up to two years later, compared with those at hospitals in nearby cities that didn’t see the disease. That outbreak lasted just four months. The COVID-19 pandemic is now in its tenth month. “I’ve had conversations with people who’ve been nurses for 25 years, and all of them say the same thing: ‘We’ve never worked in this environment before,’” says Jennifer Gil from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, who contracted COVID-19 herself in March. “How much can meditation or mental-health resources help when we’re doing this every day?” Even after cases stop climbing, health-care workers will have to catch up on a new round of procedures that didn’t happen because of COVID-19—but without the adrenaline that a packed hospital brings. “Everyone talks about fatigue during the surge, but one of the hardest things is coming down from it,” Popescu says. “You’re exhausted but you still don’t get that mental break.” Read: Long-haulers are redefining COVID-19 As hard as the work fatigue is, the “societal fatigue” is harder, said Hatton, the Utah pulmonary specialist. He is tired of walking out of an ICU where COVID-19 has killed another patient, and walking into a grocery store where he hears people saying it doesn’t exist. Health-care workers and public-health officials have received threats and abusive messages accusing them of fearmongering. They’ve watched as friends have adopted Donald Trump’s lies about doctors juking the hospitalization numbers to get more money. They’ve pleaded with family members to wear masks and physically distance, lest they end up competing for ICU beds that no longer exist. “Nurses have been the most trusted profession for 18 years in a row, which is now bullshit because no one is listening to us,” Neville said. Trump is still falsely claiming victory over the virus that ran amok because of his incompetence, and he is unlikely to do anything more to control it during the dusk of his presidency. Neither a vaccine nor a Biden administration will arrive quickly enough to turn the current surge around. The next months will be bleak. But Biden’s election “has given me a second wind,” Fayanju says. Biden openly wears a mask, and has urged Americans to do the same. He has released a sound COVID-19 plan that, he said during his acceptance speech, is “built on a bedrock of science.” He has assembled a coronavirus task force composed of 13 people with medical expertise. He has committed to rejoining the World Health Organization. His presidency, many health-care workers hope, will mark a newfound commitment to stopping the pandemic, restoring the humbled Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and ending a steady stream of gaslighting and misinformation from the federal government itself. “I slept this weekend like I haven’t slept since February—without the same demons,” Choo says. “I woke up doped up on sleep.” Choo also studies the impacts of health-care policy, and has found that health-care systems sometimes react to imminent policies months before they are actually come into force. Could that happen with Biden’s pandemic plan? “It absolutely could, and there’s precedent for it,” she says. She expects that state leaders will start to coalesce around his plan and consult with his task force. Still, “you can’t just fix a pandemic this far down the rabbit hole,” Popescu says. “I’m hopeful, but I don’t expect this to suddenly turn itself around overnight.” Biden will inherit a health-care system that is battered at best and broken at worst, a polarized electorate, and many local leaders who are doubling down on bad policies. Trump won Iowa by eight points, which Governor Kim Reynolds took as validation of the state’s COVID-19 response thus far. Bars, restaurants, and schools in Iowa are still fully open, and a recently announced mask mandate applies only for gatherings of 25 people or more. “That takes away my hope,” Perencevich said. “We can’t just sit on our hands and wait for Jan. 20 to come,” said Megan Ranney, the Rhode Island physician. Several health-care workers I spoke with are trying to keep mild cases of COVID-19 from becoming severe enough to warrant an ICU bed. The Oak Street Health primary-care centers deliver fluids, pulse oximeters, and smart tablets to the homes of newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients, so doctors can check on their symptoms virtually. In North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, the Sanford Health network has set up outpatient “infusion centers” where elderly COVID-19 patients or those with chronic illnesses can get drugs that might slow the progression of their disease. These drugs will include the antibody therapy bamlanivimab, which received an emergency-use authorization from the FDA on Monday, Suttle told me. But the best strategy remains the obvious one: Keep people from getting infected at all. Once again, the fate of the U.S. health-care system depends on the collective action of its citizens. Once again, the nation must flatten the curve. This need not involve a lockdown. We now know that the coronavirus mostly spreads through the air, and does so easily when people spend prolonged periods together in poorly ventilated areas. People can reduce their risk by wearing masks and avoiding indoor spaces such as restaurants, bars, and gyms, where the possibility of transmission is especially high (no matter how often these places clean their surfaces). Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings, for which several generations will travel around the country for days of close indoor contact and constant conversation, will be risky too. Preliminary results suggest that at least one effective vaccine is on the way. The choices made in the coming weeks will influence how many Americans die before they have a chance to receive it, and how many health-care workers are broken in the process.","NOVEMBER 13, 2020"
You're Getting Too Much Healthcare - The Atlantic,9435,"For people who had been awaiting the rollout of the Affordable Care Act in order to obtain health insurance for the first time, the major problem associated with American healthcare has been a lack of access to it. But for a surprising number of Americans, the greater problem may be exactly the opposite: They are receiving too much healthcare. And that’s not good news for either their wallets or their physical well-being. The most recent estimate from the Institute of Medicine is that about 30 percent of total healthcare expenditures in America go toward unneeded care. Doctors, too, have acknowledged the problem: In a 2011 survey published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, 42 percent of American primary care physicians said that patients in their own practice were getting more care than necessary. Excessive care typically takes the form of overabundant referrals to specialists, more diagnostic tests than would be medically necessary, or too many prescriptions—but in some cases, it can extend to actual treatments or surgeries that are not clinically indicated. Richard Baron, president of the American Board of Internal Medicine, is candid about the problem. “There were and are lots of things being done in healthcare that don’t reliably benefit patients,” he says. From a patient perspective, it can be hard to see at first glance how too much care could be a problem. What’s wrong with an extra test, just to be safe? That almost sounds like a good thing. But unneeded healthcare can be physically damaging. “Anything we do in medicine and healthcare has expected benefits and harms,” says Brenda Sirovich, a research associate at the VA Medical Center in White River Junction, Vermont, and the lead researcher behind the physician survey mentioned earlier. “Any time you have an intervention for a patient, no matter how small […] there is also the chance that it’s going to do some harm.” She points to the example of CT scans: for patients who are genuinely sick, they’re an important diagnostic tool. But they also expose patients to radiation, and when used too liberally, their harms outweigh their benefits. Even for initial screening tests that pose no risk in themselves, there’s the problem of the “downstream effect;” if the first test produces an ambiguous result or a false positive, it can lead to more invasive testing that does carry substantial risk. “As you intervene on patients who have less and less reason to intervene and less and less chance of benefiting, you still retain that probability of harming them,” says Sirovich. “In a word, that is the biggest problem with doing too much—the risk of harm.” In some cases, the roots of the excess care are noble: Doctors just want to provide the best possible care for their patients. The operating assumption for many both inside and outside the medical field tends to be that if a little care does a little good, a lot of care will do a lot of good. Given the time constraints that many physicians are under, it can seem safest to default to over-ordering. But there are several other major drivers of overutilization, as well. Experts debate exactly how much the threat of lawsuits influences physicians in their practice of medicine, but physicians themselves say that fear of legal challenges is a substantial factor in motivating them to provide too much care. (In Sirovich’s physician survey, malpractice was cited far more frequently than any other factor as incentivizing physicians to do more than they felt was clinically necessary.) Skeptics challenge that physicians might not be in the best position to know exactly what motivates their own behavior. But a study published in Health Affairs this summer suggests that the malpractice effect is real. According to the report, doctors who acknowledge having a strong fear of malpractice are more likely to show a pattern of ordering aggressive diagnostic tests, and they’re also more likely to refer patients to the ER for treatment. This makes intuitive sense: Doctors are rarely asked if they did too much, but they are constantly questioned as to whether or not they did enough—and they know they can wind up in legal trouble if patients don’t think their care was sufficient. Perhaps more troubling than medical liability issues are the financial incentives inherent in the American healthcare system. Most American healthcare currently operates on a fee-for-service model, where physicians receive payment for every service performed, regardless of whether that service actually benefits the patient or not. In some cases, especially where physicians self-refer their patients for expensive diagnostic tests and treatments, there can be substantial financial incentives for ordering interventions that might not be medically necessary. Several recent studies have explored whether financial incentives influence how physicians practice, and the answer, unsurprisingly, is that they do. In October, for example, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine examined the “self-referral effect” among urologists treating patients for prostate cancer. The study found that doctors are substantially more likely to order radiation therapy for their prostate cancer patients if those doctors have ownership interests in the radiation services they are offering. Over the five-year period from 2005 to 2010, the use of radiation therapy by self-referring urologists in private practice jumped 19.2 percentage points, whereas the rate among their non self-referring peers barely budged, going up just 1.3 percentage points. Jean Mitchell, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and the author of the report, acknowledges that her study can’t ultimately speak to the motivations of the physicians involved. But she sees reason to be concerned. “There’s been this dramatic trend [among self-referring physicians] toward aggressive treatment of prostate cancer, even though basically the clinical data suggest that we should move away from that,” she says. “The issue is that it seems like [patients are] being steered toward the treatment that is going to have the most financial benefit for the urologist.” The self-referral effect isn’t unique to radiology. Earlier this summer, a report of the United States Government Accountability Office examined rates of referrals for biopsies and found that between 2004 and 2010, referrals for biopsies more than doubled among self-referring physicians, even while they increased only 38 percent among those who referred outside their own practices. Another report published in Radiology in September found the same pattern among physicians referring for advanced knee imaging. Of course, self-referrals aren't all bad: proponents argue that they allow physicians to make diagnoses quickly and that they offer patients easier access to needed tests and treatments. Still, it’s hard for Mitchell not to think physicians are self-referring more than necessary. “I don’t entirely blame the doctors,” she says. “A lot of this is the equipment manufacturers too. They’re out there trying to sell what they manufacture. [But] it’s really scary.” As physicians, researchers, and policy experts have grown to recognize the problem of excessive care, there have been a number of attempts to combat the problem. One of the most talked-about provisions of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, for example, is the provision for Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Under this provision, a network of doctors and hospitals that agrees to act as an ACO receives financial incentives to figure out how to maximize quality while simultaneously reducing costs and eliminating waste in the system. The idea is to encourage healthcare networks to take more collective responsibility for population health and reward better care, rather than simply more care. Physician groups are also stepping up to solve the problem. One widely publicized effort is the Choosing Wisely campaign, an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation. Realizing that stewardship of finite resources has been a weakness of the medical community, the campaign set out to promote conversations between doctors and patients about utilizing the most effective tests and treatments while avoiding unnecessary care. To this end, organizers began calling on physician societies to compile lists of the top five tests and procedures in their respective specialties that were most susceptible to overuse. To date, more than 50 physician societies have joined the campaign, each contributing their own “top 5” list. For Sirovich, these initiatives offer signs of hope. Fifteen years ago, she says, conversations about the harms of medical care or excessive spending weren't likely to come up, but today, she hears more patients—and fellow physicians—talking about the harms of overuse. “We’re definitely seeing some signs that people are starting to think differently about this,” she says. But despite hints of change, the problem of overutilization is likely to persist for some time. After all, it took more than a century to construct the current healthcare system, and change does not come easily. “There’s an inertia in how we think about things, there’s an inertia in how we've organized our system, and there’s an inertia in parties that benefit from the way things have been,” says Sirovich. “I do think we’re going to be struggling with this for a while.”","DECEMBER 9, 2013"
U.S. Healthcare: Most Expensive and Worst Performing - The Atlantic,2359,"The origin of the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" is sometimes attributed to the fashion mogul Aldo Gucci, who said, ""The bitterness of low quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price has faded."" But when it comes to healthcare, Americans get neither quality nor affordability. The United States healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, but when it comes to health outcomes, it performs worse than 11 other similar industrialized nations, according to a new report released today by the Commonwealth Fund. The nonprofit examined the health systems of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and it found that the U.S. was last or near-last in measures of health access, efficiency, and equity. According to the report, the United Kingdom, which has a single-payer healthcare system, ranks first. In second place is Switzerland, which like the U.S. has a compulsory health insurance system—though Swiss health insurers are not allowed to make a profit off their basic insurance plans. It's important to note that one reason for America's lag, as the authors explain, is our historic absence of universal health coverage. But the data for the report was collected before the full implementation of Obamacare, which dramatically expanded health insurance, so it's possible that the U.S. may rise in future rankings. And notably, both the U.K. and U.S. ranked low on the ""Healthy lives"" scale, which considers infant mortality, healthy life expectancy at age 60, and mortality from preventable conditions, such as high blood pressure. The U.S. spends 17.7 percent of GDP on healthcare, much more than all of the other countries, while Australia spends the least—8.9 percent: The metric the U.S. performed best on was ""effective care."" Particularly laudable were our preventative care efforts, which included things like physicians asking patients to eat healthy and exercise, and doctors' offices sending patients appointment reminders. The U.S. fared poorly, meanwhile, when it came to managing administrative hassles for both doctors and patients, avoiding emergency room use, and reducing duplicative medical testing, all part of the score for ""efficient care."" Americans also had the worst equity of care between high-income and low-income patients.","JUNE 16, 2014"
Here's a Map of the Countries That Provide Universal Health Care (America's Still Not on It) - The Atlantic,3256,"The U.S. stands almost entirely alone among developed nations that lack universal health care. As excited as American liberals and proponents of expanding access to health care might be about the Supreme Court's decision to largely uphold the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. still stands out from much of the developed world in state efforts to make medical care available to the public. If universal health care in the U.S. is your goal, then today was a big step forward, but maybe also a reminder of how far behind America still lags. The above map shows, in green, countries that administer some sort of universal health care plan. Most are through compulsory but government-subsidized public insurance plans, such as the UK's National Health Service. Some countries that have socialized and ostensibly universal health care systems but do not actually apply them universally, for example in poverty- and corruption-rife states in Africa or Latin America, are not counted. What's astonishing is how cleanly the green and grey separate the developed nations from the developing, almost categorically. Nearly the entire developed world is colored, from Europe to the Asian powerhouses to South America's southern cone to the Anglophone states of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The only developed outliers are a few still-troubled Balkan states, the Soviet-style autocracy of Belarus, and the U.S. of A., the richest nation in the world. The handful of developing countries that provide universal access to health care include oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Oman, Latin success story Costa Rica, Kyrgyzstan, and, famously, Cuba, among a few others. A number of countries have attempted universal health care but failed, such as South Africa, which maintains a notoriously inefficient and troubled public plan to complement the private plans popular among middle- and upper-class citizens. None of this is to downplay the importance of today's Supreme Court ruling for supporters of the U.S. effort to expand health care coverage, nor to argue that U.S. health care is equivalent to that in, say, Egypt or Belarus. It's precisely because the quality of U.S. health care is so high that makes this map interesting. That brings us to another way that America is a big outlier on health care. The grey countries on this map tend to spend significantly less per capita on health care than do the green countries -- except for the U.S., where the government spends way more on health care per person than do most countries with free, universal health care. This is also true of health care costs as a share of national GDP -- in other words, how much of a country's money goes into health care. ""The overall level of health spending in the United States is so high that public (i.e. government) spending on health per capita is still greater than in all other OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, except Norway and the Netherlands,"" according to a recent OECD report, which covers most of the developed world. Whether or not that will change with President Obama's health care reform now Supreme Court-approved, access to health care will remain yet another way in which the U.S. stands out from the rest of the developed world.","JUNE 29, 2012"
Why Do Other Rich Nations Spend So Much Less on Healthcare? - The Atlantic,8599,"Despite the news last week that America's healthcare spending will not be rising at the sky-high rate that was once predicted, the fact remains that the U.S. far outspends its peer nations when it comes to healthcare costs per capita. This year the United States will spend almost 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare—six percentage points more than the Netherlands, the next highest spender. Because the U.S. GDP in 2014 will be approximately 17 trillion dollars, those six percentage points over the Netherlands amount to one trillion dollars in additional spending. The burden to the average household through lost wages, insurance premiums, taxes, out-of-pocket care, and other costs will be more than $8,000. Why does the United States spend so much more? The biggest reason is that U.S. healthcare delivers a more expensive mix of services. For example, a much larger proportion of physician visits in the U.S. are to specialists who get higher fees and usually order more high-tech diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than primary care physicians. Compared with the average OECD country, the U.S. delivers (population adjusted) almost three times as many mammograms, two-and-a-half times the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C-sections. Also, the U.S. has more stand-by equipment, for example, 1.66 MRI machines per 6,000 annual scans vs. 1.06 machines. The extra machines provide easier access for Americans, but add to cost. Similarly, occupancy rates in U.S. acute care hospitals are much lower than in OECD countries, reducing the likelihood of delays in admissions, but building that extra capacity adds to cost. Aggressive treatment of very sick elderly also makes the mix expensive. In the U.S. many elderly patients are treated in intensive care units (ICUs), but in other countries they would receive only palliative care. More amenities such as privacy and space in hospitals and more attractive clinics also add to U.S. costs. While the U.S. mix of services is disproportionately tilted toward more expensive interventions, the other OECD countries emphasize a “plain vanilla” mix. Compared with the U.S., the average OECD country has 30 percent more physician visits and more than 30 percent more hospital days per capita. One reason for the more expensive mix in the U.S. is it produces more income for drug manufacturers, specialist physicians, and others who have considerable influence on policy. Second, some patients prefer the more expensive mix, just as some prefer to shop at Whole Foods rather than Walmart. Third, some workers mistakenly believe that employers pay for their healthcare and that more expensive means better care. Health economists believe that the premiums for employer-sponsored insurance come out of potential wages. Similarly, the extra money the government spends for health could be used for education, infrastructure, the environment, and other public investment, but these alternatives are not readily apparent or agreed upon. Does the more expensive mix result in better health outcomes? There are no definitive studies to answer this question. Superficially, it appears that the systems in the other countries are more effective because their life expectancy is higher. But their advantage may be attributable to non-medical factors such as significantly lower poverty rates. A second important reason for higher healthcare spending in the U.S. is higher prices for inputs such as drugs and the services of specialist physicians. The prices of branded prescription drugs in the U.S. are, on average, about double those in other countries. The fees of specialist physicians are typically two to three times as high as in other countries. The lower prices and fees abroad are achieved by negotiation and controls by governments who typically pay for about 75 percent of all medical care. Government in the U.S. pays about 50 percent, which would still confer considerable bargaining power, but the government is kept from exerting it by legislation and a Congress sensitive to interest-group lobbying. The third and last important reason for higher spending in the U.S. is high administrative costs of insurance. This includes private insurance which covers more than half the insured population. Each year scores of insurance companies must estimate appropriate premiums for plans they wish to sell to several million employers plus 20 to 30 million individuals. In addition, hospitals, clinics, and individual physicians incur substantial costs in billing for each test, visit, and procedure regardless of whether they are covered by private or public insurance or self-pay. Many of our peer countries have lower administrative costs through more coordination, standardization, and in some countries a single national system or several regional healthcare-insurance systems, even when the provision of care is primarily a private-sector responsibility. The complexity of private-sector insurance is not in the public interest. Each company offers many plans that differ in coverage, deductibles, co-pays, premiums, and other features that make it difficult for buyers to compare the prices of different policies. For most goods and services, wider choice for consumers is assumed to contribute to well-being. In the case of health insurance, however, the fact that the customer knows more than the insurance company about his or her likely use of care results in adverse selection. If the company sets a premium based on average utilization, the company will lose money on the high users and will lose as customers those who expect to use less than the average. It is not efficient or fair to allow a family to choose a plan with generous maternity benefits when they are planning to have a baby and then switch to a plan with no maternity benefits when they are not. If we turn the question around and ask why healthcare costs so much less in other high-income countries, the answer nearly always points to a larger, stronger role for government. Governments usually eliminate much of the high administrative costs of insurance, obtain lower prices for inputs, and influence the mix of healthcare outputs by arranging for large supplies of primary-care physicians and hospital beds while keeping tight control on the number of specialist physicians and expensive technology. In the United States, the political system creates many “choke points” for diverse interest groups to block or modify government’s role in these areas. For those who would like to limit government control, there is an alternative route to more efficient healthcare through “managed competition,” proposed by Alain Enthoven, a Stanford University Business School Professor, more than 25 years ago. It is based on integrated group practice, which brings the insurance function, physicians, hospital, drugs, and other elements of care into a single organization that takes responsibility for the health of a defined population for an annual risk-adjusted per capita payment. Examples include the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound in Seattle and the Kaiser Permanente organizations in California. Such organizations deliver high-quality care at lower costs, and some employers offer such a plan as one option, but most don’t. And even those employers that do offer a low-cost integrated group practice as an option typically pay the same percentage subsidy of premium regardless of whether the employee chooses an expensive plan or the low-cost plan. For managed competition to be most effective, employees should be required to pay the marginal excess of a high-cost plan over the low-cost plan. For one large employer who did follow this approach, 71 percent of the hourly paid men chose the low-cost integrated group practice while 63 percent of the salaried men chose one of the more expensive plans. (This statistic comes from a study in progress by Enthoven and myself.) With regard to healthcare, the United States is at a crossroads. Whether the Affordable Care Act will significantly control costs is uncertain; its main thrust is to reduce the number of uninsured. The alternatives seem to be a larger role for government or a larger role for managed competition in the private sector. Even if the latter route is pursued, government is the only logical choice if the country wants to have universal coverage. There are two necessary and sufficient conditions to cover everyone for health insurance: Subsidies for the poor and the sick and compulsory participation by everyone. Only government can create those conditions.","JULY 23, 2014"
What If America Had Canada's Healthcare System? - The Atlantic,3318,"It's not uncommon, when Republicans score a major political victory, for American liberals to throw up their hands and say, ""Screw this! I'm moving to Canada."" More often than not, it's an empty threat—deterred either by the intricacies of the visa process or a glance at the January weather forecast in Winnipeg. But what if the opposite happened? What if Canada moved here? Specifically, what if its healthcare system were to pack up, migrate southward, and rain its single-payer munificence over America, for a change? Earlier this year, the Commonwealth Fund released a ranking of 11 developed countries' healthcare systems. The American one, the world's most expensive, ranked dead last. As I wrote at the time, the U.S. scored poorly on managing administrative hassles for both doctors and patients, avoiding emergency-room use, and reducing duplicative medical testing, among other things. To be fair, the Canadian system didn't fare much better, coming in 10th out of 11. Still, according to a new interactive released by the Commonwealth Fund and based on the earlier report, if Americans had Canada's healthcare, we might see some surprising gains in our quality of life and reductions in our healthcare expenditures. First, the good news: 5,400 fewer babies would die in infancy, and we'd save about $1.3 trillion dollars in healthcare spending. (The green blocks on the right show the number of dollars or lives saved, while the red blocks on the left show the expenditures or deaths that would still happen.) What's more, 57 million fewer people would go without medical care because of the cost. ""Roughly 40 percent of both insured and uninsured U.S. respondents spent $1,000 or more out-of-pocket during the year on medical care, not counting premiums,"" the report authors write. (Though, it's worth noting that the data for the report was collected before the full implementation of Obamacare, which dramatically expanded health insurance coverage in the U.S.) And, perhaps as a result, more than 50,000 preventable deaths would be avoided: But it wouldn't all be good news. Canada's free system comes at the cost of greater wait times for some services. In 2010, the Commonwealth Fund found that 33 percent of Canadians waited six days or more to see a specialist, compared with 19 percent of Americans. And Canadians tend to wait longer for ER care than patients in other countries: One in 10 patients in a Canadian ER will wait eight hours or more, and the average wait time is four hours. (Here, the shorter red blocks below represent how many additional patients would have to wait or would visit the ER if we had the Canadian system.) On top of that, more people would visit the ER in general: That last point could either be a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. On one hand, having lots of ER patients is expensive and inefficient for hospitals, and Canadians might be headed to emergency departments because wait times for regular doctors are too long. But on the other hand, it's free for patients—so, some might wonder, why not use it if it's there? The Commonwealth Fund site's interactive allows users to compare the healthcare systems of 11 different countries, so if Canada's not your cup of tea, you can try, say, England, or Sweden, or France. Bon healthcare voyage!","OCTOBER 21, 2014"
What the U.S. Can Learn From Brazil's Healthcare Mess - The Atlantic,21194,"On a recent afternoon in Boa Vista, a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Sao Paulo, Brazil, Noranei Oliveira Miranda waited patiently on a small couch for the local community health workers to arrive. Her aging father, Dirceu, was seated next to her, not as patiently. Trembling and non-verbal, he reared up from the couch and reached in vain for the front door. She held him down with a pillow, her strong arms forming a seatbelt across his torso. “Sit still, dad!” she cried in Portuguese. Dirceu was a professional driver until Alzheimer’s robbed him of his mental faculties and an HIV infection further depleted him. Now he’s delirious and desperate to get back onto the hilly, narrow streets where he made his living as a younger man. His face is riddled with wounds from falls he incurred during past escape attempts. Noranei, the youngest child, has quit her restaurant job to help take care of him. At last, the health workers arrived, clad in matching sky-blue vests. “Look, it’s Daiana and Gabriela!” Noranei told her father. Dirceu smiled and stopped flailing. The two health workers are middle-aged women who live in the community. They aren’t doctors, nor do they have any medical training. But they spend their days making the rounds through the 180 or so local families that have been assigned to them, asking, essentially, “How’s life?” They make sure Dirceu feels okay on his HIV medications. They admonish kids not to drink standing water and diabetics not to eat too many cookies. If one of their charges is having a personal problem—say with domestic abuse or alcohol—they try to help. They’re armed with exercise and nutrition tips, but they don’t dispense medication. Overall, they help ensure no one gets lost in Brazil’s enormous state-sponsored healthcare system. “I feel good because they help me,” said Maria Camargo, a wheelchair-bound 68-year-old woman, when Daiana and Gabriela dropped in for a visit. “No one forgets about me.” Ever since 1988, the Brazilian constitution has promised free public healthcare to every citizen. “‘Health is a private right and a duty of the state,’” said Alexandre Chiavegatto Filho, a health policy professor at the University of Sao Paulo, quoting the statute. “People do love that phrase. It would be crazy and impossible for any government to change that.” By a lot of measures, Brazil’s Sistema Único de Saúde—or SUS—has led to huge health gains. The country now has an infant mortality rate of about 13 per 1,000 live births, down from about 27 in 2000. Maternal mortality has also been cut in half since 1990. The average Brazilian only lived to about 66 in 1990; today, life expectancy is at a respectable 74. But take a closer look, and the system seems more like “a safety net with holes,” as one Brazilian doctor put it to me. There are only about two hospital beds for every 1,000 people. It can take months to get an X-ray in Sao Paulo. A quarter of Brazilians are able to afford private doctors, paying with American-style insurance they get through work. But a sizable chunk of the population is still poor, living in remote jungles and farms or in ghettoized favelas, and relies on the publicly funded SUS. The health outcomes of the two groups are just as strikingly different as their life circumstances. In a 2013 poll, 48 percent of respondents said they thought healthcare was Brazil’s biggest problem, ranking the issue well above education, corruption, violence, and unemployment. In other words, universal healthcare looks very different in Brazil than it does in, say, Scandinavia. Finland, for example, provides free healthcare to all its citizens, but the country is smaller and more homogeneous than the state of Minnesota. Brazil, meanwhile, has 200 million people. And it has roughly the same landmass of the continental U.S., if you shaved off the entire West Coast and some of Florida. Brazil was also one of the last countries in the Western world to abolish slavery, and it has the lasting racial issues to show for it. In essence, Brazil is not unlike a slightly smaller, warmer America, except with soccer. Here, then, is what the U.S. can learn from Brazil’s healthcare system—and where we should avoid imitating them at all costs. Americans have been resisting the idea of universal healthcare since at least the 1940s, when President Harry Truman tried to launch a federal program to train doctors and insure every American. His effort disintegrated amid anti-Soviet sentiments. “Would socialized medicine lead to socialization of other phases of American life?” asked one pamphlet put out by the American Medical Association at the time. “Lenin thought so.” By that time, most nations in Northern Europe had been running national healthcare programs for years. Germany was the first: In 1883, Otto von Bismarck sought to shore up his power by granting sick leave and health insurance to workers. Some neighboring countries followed Germany’s lead; others, like the U.K., opted for a single-payer system, which is like Medicare for everyone. But in America, fears of income redistribution loomed large. On a 1961 LP record, Ronald Reagan called medicine “one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people.” To this day, conservatives often use the word “socialism” as a kind of shorthand for the dangers of Obamacare. Brazil was unbothered by such taboos in the late 1980s, when it transitioned to democracy after a brutal 20-year military dictatorship. Throughout the 60s and 70s, the country’s health indicators had lagged far behind those of its neighbors. Disproportionate shares of housing subsidies and social welfare money had gone, perversely, to the wealthy. A patchwork of insurance plans had covered certain unionized and white-collar workers, while a clumsy and cash-strapped health ministry was supposed to help the vast underclass. The poor had gone not just without healthcare, but also without essentials like water, sewage, and housing. A 1979 New York Times article noted that in the favelas, “disease from vermin is rampant among children.” Democracy movements throughout the late 70s and 80s pressed for social-service reform, and after the military regime collapsed in 1985, social welfare spending increased by a third in just three years. The 1988 Constitution comprised 245 articles that touched nearly every dimension of Brazilian life. Along with provisions abolishing censorship and creating maternity leave, it enshrined healthcare as a basic right. Today, the SUS is cherished as a protection against steep medical bills. “Brazil has the lowest rate of catastrophic health expenditures (2.2 percent) of nearly any other country in the region,” James Macinko, an associate professor of public health at New York University, told me. “That is a higher level of financial protection than Chile, Mexico, and certainly the U.S. have achieved.” Universal healthcare is also, as it turns out, relatively cheap: Brazil spends just 9 percent of GDP on healthcare to the U.S.’s 18 percent. But the funding for the SUS system is split between the federal, state, and municipal governments, and that’s where the trouble begins. Brazilians in the wealthy south tend to live better, healthier lives than their poorer northern countrymen. The infant mortality rate of the north is twice as high as that of the south. That poor northeastern area of Maranhao has only about 0.58 doctors per 1,000 people, while the richer Rio de Janeiro has 3.44. The richest fifth of Brazil’s population is twice as likely to receive prenatal care as the poorest fifth. In 2012, between 62 and 75 percent of people in the south who needed kidney transplants received one, but only 13 to 27 of those living in the rest of Brazil were able to. “In addition to a lack of adequate laboratories, blood circulation support networks, and intensive care units, there is an ongoing shortage of essential healthcare infrastructure, such as beds and X-ray machines,” wrote Eduardo Gomez, a senior lecturer in international development at King’s College London, in a recent working paper. “Again, the more affluent southern region fares better … when compared to the north.” Although high-earners tend to visit private doctors, they flock to the public system to get costly procedures, crowding out poor people who have no choice but to use the SUS. And rich Brazilians take their right to free healthcare seriously. A 2011 Lancet article described how the wealthy often sue for pricey experimental drugs or elective procedures to be provided to them for free. After all, they argue, the constitution demands it. In 2008, Rio Grande do Sul spent 22 percent of its total drug budget to comply with 19,000 such court orders. “There have been efforts by health managers to ‘educate’ judges so that they would not issue such court orders,” Cesar Victoria, author of the Lancet article, told me. “But it still happens all the time.”  In Brazil, as in the U.S., income inequality impacts health in banal, hidden ways. “If you're wealthy you’re fine. If you’re poor, you’re not,” Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American studies program at Johns Hopkins University, told me. When Recife’s sanitation workers recently protested their poor working conditions, free sunscreen was among their demands. At a Recife bodega, a 200-milliliter bottle of SPF 30 costs 35 reais, or $15.60. Brazil’s minimum wage is 2.48 reais per hour (about $1.12). “When you put sunscreen on, you need the amount of a cup of espresso and to put all over your skin,” said Claudia Magalhaes, a dermatologist in Recife, told me. “You have to repeat it every two hours. Then, if you stay around six hours in the sun, you need around two bottles.” By some measures, Brazil’s income inequality is even worse than America’s. One segment of the population—the part that conjures up images of Gisele Bundchen and microscopic swimsuits—is modern and rich, employing household help and dining out on $50 steaks. Then there are the 11.4 million people living in favelas where, according to Rodrigo D'Aurea, a primary-care doctor in Boa Vista, crack is “easier to get than McDonalds.” In these communities, drug lords rule the streets, open sewers spread disease, and social services are sparsely provided. On the outskirts of Recife, I met teenagers who were raising newborns in plywood shacks—partly because abortion is illegal in Brazil, but also because having children is one of the few status symbols available to the country’s slum-dwelling girls. Brazil also has a newish middle class—36 million people who climbed out of extreme poverty in the past few decades. This group is now struggling with American-style non-communicable diseases. “Junk food is the first thing that comes with economic development,” Janos Valery Gyuricza, a primary care physician, said. He calls the Boa Vista neighborhood where he works, “a dormitory for mid-low and lower-class workers, who need to travel between an hour and 30 minutes to three hours to come and go to work every day. The lack of open-air spaces for leisure and sports are clear.” Nearly half of Brazilians are overweight, and about 15 percent are obese. At the current rate, Brazil’s obesity rate could reach that of America’s by 2022. The country has swung so rapidly from malnutrition to obesity that it prompted former Health Minister José Temporão to exclaim in 2010, “We are in a situation of red alert … We are sitting on a ticking time bomb!” As in the U.S., healthier food is pricier in Brazil, and most people get too little exercise. Gyms are for the ultra-rich, favelas are at times too violent for exercise, and with an unemployment rate of about 5 percent, everyone else is busy hustling to and from work. Over the past half-century, Brazilians have also been moving from farms to urban centers, distancing themselves from their traditional cooking practices. At a clinic near Recife, a patient named Paulete Alves Do Nasceimento tells me that until recently few in the community had diabetes, but now, “it’s everywhere.” She said she now has it, too, but she doesn’t know why. “Maybe it's because I gained weight,” she said. “I gained a lot of weight.” At Brazil’s public clinics, children wait on bare benches in the hallways as their mothers check in with rushed doctors. The rooms are hot and stuffy; the walls look like no one ever had time to paint them. Doctors bring their own furniture from home. One clinic I visited had something Americans might find unthinkable: several non-partitioned dental chairs in one room. These clinics get the job done, but to Americans, being treated at one might hold all of the allure of getting one’s blood drawn at a low-rent pizza shop. There are roughly 40,000 of these bare-bones health centers throughout the country. The doctors there work in teams with the community health workers and nurses. The Spartan ethic results in conveniences: Each family’s medical records are held in one folder; medication is dispensed right at the clinic. And annoyances: The medication sometimes runs out; electronic records are a distant dream. Noranei explained how her neighborhood had been divvied up into “zones” of different colors to better allocate doctors’ appointments. ""They said, ‘You’re from the ‘green area,’ so you have to go in the morning. But I work, so I can’t get there at that time."" The private system comes with shorter wait times and better facilities, but it has its own problems. “It's a money machine,” said Ivana Borges, a Recife woman in her 20s, describing how her private doctor had harangued her into getting a C-section—all while complaining that he couldn’t wait to wrap up so he could finish his whisky. One Sao Paulo doctor told me that some physicians exact bribes in exchange for allowing mothers to deliver naturally, since C-sections are more efficient and lucrative. Wealthy patients may complain about corruption and poor bedside manner, but at least they have specialists at their disposal. In Brazil, as in the United States, doctors tend to come from wealthier areas—and largely, that’s where they stay. More than half of the country’s neurologists, for example, live along the well-heeled southeast corridor; just one percent live in the north. Few young doctors want to set up shop in one-horse towns on the fringes of the jungle, where equipment is shoddy, if it’s there at all, and job opportunities for spouses are nonexistent. (Think of Joel Fleischman, the Jewish New York doctor banished to Alaska in the 1990s TV series Northern Exposure.) “Brazil is a fairly elitist society, so if you’re a doctor practicing in Sao Paulo, you have no interest in going to the Amazon, or to a poor rural state,” Roett said. “The frustration of going to work every day is going to undermine your morale.” Even in urban areas, entire clinics lack pediatricians or other key providers for years at a time. “You have to take four busses to get to the ER,” said Gyuricza, the Boa Vista physician. “Your stomach could explode before you get there.” One woman told me about making a specialist appointment and arriving after a long, expensive bus journey to learn that it had been cancelled. The shortages are part of what sparked last summer’s protests in Brazil’s major cities. The country is hosting the World Cup this June—a huge source of pride for a soccer-worshipping country. (Imagine an American city hosting the Super Bowl, the World Series, and an international hot-dog eating championship all at once.) But some aren’t thrilled at the expense of it all. “We have beautiful and monumental stadiums,” goes one line in a viral protest song called “Desculpa Neymar” (Neymar is a popular Brazilian soccer star). “In the meantime schools and hospitals are about to fail. I saw an abyss between the two Brazils.” Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff responded to the complaints by swearing to bolster healthcare. Over the past year, her government imported 13,000 doctors from abroad, primarily Cuba. Maria Cristina Neves, a Spanish physician who came to a clinic near Recife three months ago under this “Mais Medicos” (More Doctors) program, said she was struck by the disparities in the system. “In Spain, people believe everyone should have the same health system,” Neves said. “That’s a concept that has to be started here. And that’s a big challenge.” Still, she doesn’t live in the same rough suburb where she works, opting instead for an apartment in a chicer part of town. She recalled how a group of local men had cat-called her as she walked out of the clinic, hooting and derisively asking her for a prostate exam. “I’m a 60-year-old woman,” she said. “I don’t need to be hearing this kind of stuff. You don’t have to sacrifice yourself. I am no Mother Teresa.” In some ways, the U.S. is better positioned for universal healthcare than Brazil was in 1988. We’re far richer, and we’ve been a functioning democracy for 238 years. We also have a culture, and a network of laws, that makes it easier to avoid the waste and corruption that plague Brazil’s healthcare system. (When the Brazilian government solicited contractors for health and development projects, the call for bids appeared just an hour before the deadline—and the only firms to meet the time limit were headed by relatives of local politicians.) But American health coverage is still far from universal, even under Obamacare. Vermont and Maryland are experimenting with increasing government controls on healthcare right now, but few states are likely to follow their lead anytime soon. In fact, 19 states are refusing to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. And at least 30 million people are expected to remain uninsured even after Obamacare is fully implemented because they refuse to buy insurance on the newly created exchanges, can’t afford coverage, or are not authorized to live in the U.S. As Matthew Buettgens of the Urban Institute told the Washington Post last year, “The Obamacare law will cut the number of the uninsured in half. This is an important development, but it certainly isn’t the definition of universal.” Even so, Obamacare will give millions of Americans better access to doctors, and that’s where Brazil provides a true cautionary tale: Expanding access on paper is meaningless without the resources to make it work. According to some groups, the U.S. needs 91,500 more doctors by 2020 in order to treat the newly insured. Already, about 20 percent of Americans live in areas without enough general practitioners. Too few people from rural areas apply to medical school, and when they do, not enough want to move back to set up their practices. Live Oak County, Texas, for example, encompasses 1,000 square miles and is home to 12,000 residents. It has zero primary care physicians. And it’s not just primary care: The Association of American Medical Colleges also projects we'll need 46,000 more specialists within the next decade. Newly insured Medicaid patients will likely fare even worse: nearly a third of doctors don’t accept Medicaid patients because of the program’s lower reimbursement rates and administrative hassles. Some experts have suggested that we may soon see a two-tiered healthcare system not unlike Brazil’s, in which Medicaid patients wait weeks to see any physician available while richer patients use generous PPO plans to see the best doctors they can find. At the same time, some of Brazil’s health innovations are worth emulating. Its community health worker program now reaches about 60 percent of the population, and it’s reduced the number of people showing up at emergency rooms for low-scale maladies. The U.S. has been trying to introduce more lay healthcare liaisons, as well: A recent JAMA study found that a Pennsylvania-based community health worker pilot project decreased hospital readmissions by using workers who made just $15 an hour. Brazil has also attacked non-communicable diseases with swift social policy. The first signs of an obesity epidemic there were met with a rash of portion-control and school-lunch laws. The country’s popular Bolsa Familia program pays poor mothers to get check-ups for themselves and their children. And like many other countries with universal healthcare, Brazil aggressively negotiates drug prices to help keep prescriptions cheap and available. The country was able to sharply reduce AIDS deaths by providing free antiretrovirals after going to war with American drug companies. It may be many years before all Americans can get decent, affordable healthcare. Our staggering income inequality manifests itself in our well-being: Large segments of the U.S. population lack good housing, education, and working conditions, not to mention access to fresh food. Poor Americans live sicker and die earlier than wealthier ones, suffering at higher rates from conditions like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. As we grapple with the flaws in our own medical system, our most valuable lessons may come less from the well-oiled healthcare machinery of Northern Europe than the messy, half-fulfilled promises of Brazil. Olga Khazan reported from Brazil as a fellow with the International Reporting Project.","MAY 8, 2014"
How American Health Care Killed My Father - The Atlantic,67386,"About a week after my father’s death, The New Yorker ran an article by Atul Gawande profiling the efforts of Dr. Peter Pronovost to reduce the incidence of fatal hospital-borne infections. Pronovost’s solution? A simple checklist of ICU protocols governing physician hand-washing and other basic sterilization procedures. Hospitals implementing Pronovost’s checklist had enjoyed almost instantaneous success, reducing hospital-infection rates by two-thirds within the first three months of its adoption. But many physicians rejected the checklist as an unnecessary and belittling bureaucratic intrusion, and many hospital executives were reluctant to push it on them. The story chronicled Pronovost’s travels around the country as he struggled to persuade hospitals to embrace his reform. It was a heroic story, but to me, it was also deeply unsettling. How was it possible that Pronovost needed to beg hospitals to adopt an essentially cost-free idea that saved so many lives? Here’s an industry that loudly protests the high cost of liability insurance and the injustice of our tort system and yet needs extensive lobbying to embrace a simple technique to save up to 100,000 people. And what about us—the patients? How does a nation that might close down a business for a single illness from a suspicious hamburger tolerate the carnage inflicted by our hospitals? And not just those 100,000 deaths. In April, a Wall Street Journal story suggested that blood clots following surgery or illness, the leading cause of preventable hospital deaths in the U.S., may kill nearly 200,000 patients per year. How did Americans learn to accept hundreds of thousands of deaths from minor medical mistakes as an inevitability? My survivor’s grief has taken the form of an obsession with our health-care system. For more than a year, I’ve been reading as much as I can get my hands on, talking to doctors and patients, and asking a lot of questions. Keeping Dad company in the hospital for five weeks had left me befuddled. How can a facility featuring state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment use less-sophisticated information technology than my local sushi bar? How can the ICU stress the importance of sterility when its trash is picked up once daily, and only after flowing onto the floor of a patient’s room? Considering the importance of a patient’s frame of mind to recovery, why are the rooms so cheerless and uncomfortable? In whose interest is the bizarre scheduling of hospital shifts, so that a five-week stay brings an endless string of new personnel assigned to a patient’s care? Why, in other words, has this technologically advanced hospital missed out on the revolution in quality control and customer service that has swept all other consumer-facing industries in the past two generations? I’m a businessman, and in no sense a health-care expert. But the persistence of bad industry practices—from long lines at the doctor’s office to ever-rising prices to astonishing numbers of preventable deaths—seems beyond all normal logic, and must have an underlying cause. There needs to be a business reason why an industry, year in and year out, would be able to get away with poor customer service, unaffordable prices, and uneven results—a reason my father and so many others are unnecessarily killed. Like every grieving family member, I looked for someone to blame for my father’s death. But my dad’s doctors weren’t incompetent—on the contrary, his hospital physicians were smart, thoughtful, and hard-working. Nor is he dead because of indifferent nursing—without exception, his nurses were dedicated and compassionate. Nor from financial limitations—he was a Medicare patient, and the issue of expense was never once raised. There were no greedy pharmaceutical companies, evil health insurers, or other popular villains in his particular tragedy. Indeed, I suspect that our collective search for villains—for someone to blame—has distracted us and our political leaders from addressing the fundamental causes of our nation’s health-care crisis. All of the actors in health care—from doctors to insurers to pharmaceutical companies—work in a heavily regulated, massively subsidized industry full of structural distortions. They all want to serve patients well. But they also all behave rationally in response to the economic incentives those distortions create. Accidentally, but relentlessly, America has built a health-care system with incentives that inexorably generate terrible and perverse results. Incentives that emphasize health care over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing. And that—most important—remove consumers from our irreplaceable role as the ultimate ensurer of value. These are the impersonal forces, I’ve come to believe, that explain why things have gone so badly wrong in health care, producing the national dilemma of runaway costs and poorly covered millions. The problems I’ve explored in the past year hardly count as breakthrough discoveries—health-care experts undoubtedly view all of them as old news. But some experts, it seems, have come to see many of these problems as inevitable in any health-care system—as conditions to be patched up, papered over, or worked around, but not problems to be solved. That’s the premise behind today’s incremental approach to health-care reform. Though details of the legislation are still being negotiated, its principles are a reprise of previous reforms—addressing access to health care by expanding government aid to those without adequate insurance, while attempting to control rising costs through centrally administered initiatives. Some of the ideas now on the table may well be sensible in the context of our current system. But fundamentally, the “comprehensive” reform being contemplated merely cements in place the current system—insurance-based, employment-centered, administratively complex. It addresses the underlying causes of our health-care crisis only obliquely, if at all; indeed, by extending the current system to more people, it will likely increase the ultimate cost of true reform. I’m a Democrat, and have long been concerned about America’s lack of a health safety net. But based on my own work experience, I also believe that unless we fix the problems at the foundation of our health system—largely problems of incentives—our reforms won’t do much good, and may do harm. To achieve maximum coverage at acceptable cost with acceptable quality, health care will need to become subject to the same forces that have boosted efficiency and value throughout the economy. We will need to reduce, rather than expand, the role of insurance; focus the government’s role exclusively on things that only government can do (protect the poor, cover us against true catastrophe, enforce safety standards, and ensure provider competition); overcome our addiction to Ponzi-scheme financing, hidden subsidies, manipulated prices, and undisclosed results; and rely more on ourselves, the consumers, as the ultimate guarantors of good service, reasonable prices, and sensible trade-offs between health-care spending and spending on all the other good things money can buy. These ideas stand well outside the emerging political consensus about reform. So before exploring alternative policies, let’s reexamine our basic assumptions about health care—what it actually is, how it’s financed, its accountability to patients, and finally its relationship to the eternal laws of supply and demand. Everyone I know has at least one personal story about how screwed up our health-care system is; before spending (another) $1trillion or so on reform, we need a much clearer understanding of the causes of the problems we all experience. “Money is honey,” my grandmother used to tell me, “but health is wealth.” She said “health,” not “health care.” Listening to debates over health-care reform, it is sometimes difficult to remember that there is a difference. Medical care, of course, is merely one component of our overall health. Nutrition, exercise, education, emotional security, our natural environment, and public safety may now be more important than care in producing further advances in longevity and quality of life. (In 2005, almost half of all deaths in the U.S. resulted from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, homicide, suicide, and accidents—all of which are arguably influenced as much by lifestyle choices and living environment as by health care.) And of course even health itself is only one aspect of personal fulfillment, alongside family and friends, travel, recreation, the pursuit of knowledge and experience, and more. Yet spending on health care, by families and by the government, is crowding out spending on almost everything else. As a nation, we now spend almost 18 percent of our GDP on health care. In 1966, Medicare and Medicaid made up 1 percent of total government spending; now that figure is 20 percent, and quickly rising. Already, the federal government spends eight times as much on health care as it does on education, 12 times what it spends on food aid to children and families, 30 times what it spends on law enforcement, 78 times what it spends on land management and conservation, 87 times the spending on water supply, and 830 times the spending on energy conservation. Education, public safety, environment, infrastructure—all other public priorities are being slowly devoured by the health-care beast. It’s no different for families. From 2000 to 2008, the U.S. economy grew by $4.4 trillion; of that growth, roughly one out of every four dollars was spent on health care. Household expenditures on health care already exceed those on housing. And health care’s share is growing. By what mechanism does society determine that an extra, say, $100 billion for health care will make us healthier than even $10 billion for cleaner air or water, or $25 billion for better nutrition, or $5 billion for parks, or $10 billion for recreation, or $50 billion in additional vacation time—or all of those alternatives combined? The answer is, no mechanism at all. Health care simply keeps gobbling up national resources, seemingly without regard to other societal needs; it’s treated as an island that doesn’t touch or affect the rest of the economy. As new tests and treatments are developed, they are, for the most part, added to our Medicare or commercial insurance policies, no matter what they cost. But of course the money must come from somewhere. If the amount we spend on care had grown only at the general rate of inflation since 1970, annual health-care costs now would be roughly $5,000 less per American—that’s about 10 percent of today’s median income, to invest for the future or to spend on all the other things that contribute to our well-being. To be sure, our society has become wealthier over the years, and we’d naturally want to spend some of this new wealth on more and better health care; but how did we choose to spend this much? The housing bubble offers some important lessons for health-care policy. The claim that something—whether housing or health care—is an undersupplied social good is commonly used to justify government intervention, and policy makers have long striven to make housing more affordable. But by making housing investments eligible for special tax benefits and subsidized borrowing rates, the government has stimulated not only the construction of more houses but also the willingness of people to borrow and spend more on houses than they otherwise would have. The result is now tragically clear. As with housing, directing so much of society’s resources to health care is stimulating the provision of vastly more care. Along the way, it’s also distorting demand, raising prices, and making us all poorer by crowding out other, possibly more beneficial, uses for the resources now air-dropped onto the island of health care. Why do we view health care as disconnected from everything else? Why do we spend so much on it? And why, ultimately, do we get such inconsistent results? Any discussion of the ills within the system must begin with a hard look at the tax-advantaged comprehensive-insurance industry at its center. How often have you heard a politician say that millions of Americans “have no health care,” when he or she meant they have no health insurance? How has a method of financing health care become synonymous with care itself? The reason for financing at least some of our health care with an insurance system is obvious. We all worry that a serious illness or an accident might one day require urgent, extensive care, imposing an extreme financial burden on us. In this sense, health-care insurance is just like all other forms of insurance—life, property, liability—where the many who face a risk share the cost incurred by the few who actually suffer a loss. But health insurance is different from every other type of insurance. Health insurance is the primary payment mechanism not just for expenses that are unexpected and large, but for nearly all health-care expenses. We’ve become so used to health insurance that we don’t realize how absurd that is. We can’t imagine paying for gas with our auto-insurance policy, or for our electric bills with our homeowners insurance, but we all assume that our regular checkups and dental cleanings will be covered at least partially by insurance. Most pregnancies are planned, and deliveries are predictable many months in advance, yet they’re financed the same way we finance fixing a car after a wreck—through an insurance claim. Comprehensive health insurance is such an ingrained element of our thinking, we forget that its rise to dominance is relatively recent. Modern group health insurance was introduced in 1929, and employer-based insurance began to blossom during World War II, when wage freezes prompted employers to expand other benefits as a way of attracting workers. Still, as late as 1954, only a minority of Americans had health insurance. That’s when Congress passed a law making employer contributions to employee health plans tax-deductible without making the resulting benefits taxable to employees. This seemingly minor tax benefit not only encouraged the spread of catastrophic insurance, but had the accidental effect of making employer-funded health insurance the most affordable option (after taxes) for financing pretty much any type of health care. There was nothing natural or inevitable about the way our system developed: employer-based, comprehensive insurance crowded out alternative methods of paying for health-care expenses only because of a poorly considered tax benefit passed half a century ago. In designing Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, the government essentially adopted this comprehensive-insurance model for its own spending, and by the next year had enrolled nearly 12 percent of the population. And it is no coinci­dence that the great inflation in health-care costs began soon after. We all believe we need comprehensive health insurance because the cost of care—even routine care—appears too high to bear on our own. But the use of insurance to fund virtually all care is itself a major cause of health care’s high expense. Insurance is probably the most complex, costly, and distortional method of financing any activity; that’s why it is otherwise used to fund only rare, unexpected, and large costs. Imagine sending your weekly grocery bill to an insurance clerk for review, and having the grocer reimbursed by the insurer to whom you’ve paid your share. An expensive and wasteful absurdity, no? Is this really a big problem for our health-care system? Well, for every two doctors in the U.S., there is now one health-insurance employee—more than 470,000 in total. In 2006, it cost almost $500 per person just to administer health insurance. Much of this enormous cost would simply disappear if we paid routine and predictable health-care expenditures the way we pay for everything else—by ourselves. Society’s excess cost from health insurance’s administrative expense pales next to the damage caused by “moral hazard”—the tendency we all have to change our behavior, becoming spendthrifts and otherwise taking less care with our decisions, when someone else is covering the costs. Needless to say, much medical care is unavoidable; we don’t choose to become sick, nor do we seek more treatment than we think we need. Still, hospitals, drug companies, health insurers, and medical-device manufacturers now spend roughly $6 billion a year on advertising. If the demand for health care is purely a response to unavoidable medical need, why do these companies do so much advertising? Medical ads on TV typically inform the viewer that a specific treatment—a drug, device, surgical procedure—is available for a chronic condition. Many also note that the product or treatment is eligible for Medicare or private-insurance reimbursement. In some cases, the advertiser will offer to help the patient obtain that reimbursement. The key message: you can benefit from this product and pass the bill on to someone else. Every time you walk into a doctor’s office, it’s implicit that someone else will be paying most or all of your bill; for most of us, that means we give less attention to prices for medical services than we do to prices for anything else. Most physicians, meanwhile, benefit financially from ordering diagnostic tests, doing procedures, and scheduling follow-up appointments. Combine these two features of the system with a third—the informational advantage that extensive training has given physicians over their patients, and the authority that advantage confers—and you have a system where physicians can, to some extent, generate demand at will. Do they? Well, Medicare spends almost twice as much per patient in Dallas, where there are more doctors and care facilities per resident, as it does in Salem, Oregon, where supply is tighter. Why? Because doctors (particularly specialists) in surplus areas order more tests and treatments per capita, and keep their practices busy. Many studies have shown that the patients in areas like Dallas do not benefit in any measurable way from all this extra care. All of the physicians I know are genuinely dedicated to their patients. But at the margin, all of us are at least subconsciously influenced by our own economic interests. The data are clear: in our current system, physician supply often begets patient demand. Moral hazard has fostered an accidental collusion between providers benefiting from higher costs and patients who don’t fully bear them. In this environment, trying to control costs is awfully tough. When Medicare cut reimbursement rates in 2005 on chemotherapy and anemia drugs, for instance, it saved almost 20 percent of the previously billed costs. But Medicare’s total cancer-treatment costs actually rose almost immediately. As The New York Times reported, some physicians believed their colleagues simply performed more treatments, particularly higher-profit ones. Want further evidence of moral hazard? The average insured American and the average uninsured American spend very similar amounts of their own money on health care each year—$654 and $583, respectively. But they spend wildly different amounts of other people’s money—$3,809 and $1,103, respectively. Sometimes the uninsured do not get highly beneficial treatments because they cannot afford them at today’s prices—something any reform must address. But likewise, insured patients often get only marginally beneficial (or even outright unnecessary) care at mind-boggling cost. If it’s true that the insurance system leads us to focus on only our direct share of costs—rather than the total cost to society—it’s not surprising that insured families and uninsured ones would make similar decisions as to how much of their own money to spend on care, but very different decisions on the total amount to consume. The unfortunate fact is, health-care demand has no natural limit. Our society will always keep creating new treatments to cure previously incurable problems. Some of these will save lives or add productive years to them; many will simply make us more comfortable. That’s all to the good. But the cost of this comfort, and whether it’s really worthwhile, is never calculated—by anyone. For almost all our health-care needs, the current system allows us as consumers to ask providers, “What’s my share?” instead of “How much does this cost?”—a question we ask before buying any other good or service. And the subtle difference between those two questions is costing us all a fortune. Perhaps the greatest problem posed by our health-insurance-driven regime is the sense it creates that someone else is actually paying for most of our health care—and that the costs of new benefits can also be borne by someone else. Unfortunately, there is no one else. For fun, let’s imagine confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies. That would pay for four days of health care for all Americans. Let’s add in the profits of the 10 biggest rapacious U.S. drug companies. Another 7 days. Indeed, confiscating all the profits of all American companies, in every industry, wouldn’t cover even five months of our health-care expenses. Somebody else always seems to be paying for at least part of our health care. But that’s just an illusion. At $2.4 trillion and growing, our nation’s health-care bill is too big to be paid by anyone other than all of us. In 2007, employer-based health insurance cost, on average, more than $12,000 per family, up 78 percent since 2001. I’ve run several companies and company divisions of various sizes over the course of my career, so I can confidently tell you that raises (and even entry-level hiring) are tightly limited by rising health-care costs. You may think your employer is paying for your health care, but in fact your company’s share of the insurance premium comes out of your potential wage increase. Where else could it come from? Let’s say you’re a 22-year-old single employee at my company today, starting out at a $30,000 annual salary. Let’s assume you’ll get married in six years, support two children for 20 years, retire at 65, and die at 80. Now let’s make a crazy assumption: insurance premiums, Medicare taxes and premiums, and out-of-pocket costs will grow no faster than your earnings—say, 3 percent a year. By the end of your working days, your annual salary will be up to $107,000. And over your lifetime, you and your employer together will have paid $1.77 million for your family’s health care. $1.77 million! And that’s only after assuming the taming of costs! In recent years, health-care costs have actually grown 2 to 3 percent faster than the economy. If that continues, your 22-year-old self is looking at an additional $2 million or so in expenses over your lifetime—roughly $4 million in total. Would you have guessed these numbers were so large? If not, you have good cause: only a quarter would be paid by you directly (and much of that after retirement). The rest would be spent by others on your behalf, deducted from your earnings before you received your paycheck. And that’s a big reason why our health-care system is so expensive. Every proposal for health-care reform has featured some element of cost control to “balance” the inflationary impact of expanding access. Yet it goes without saying that in the big picture, all government efforts to control costs have failed. Why? One reason is a fixation on prices rather than costs. The government regularly tries to cap costs by limiting the reimbursement rates paid to providers by Medicare and Medicaid, and generally pays much less for each service than private insurers. But as we’ve seen, that can lead providers to perform more services, and to steer patients toward higher-priced, more lightly regulated treatments. The government’s efforts to expand “access” to care while limiting costs are like blowing up a balloon while simultaneously squeezing it. The balloon continues to inflate, but in misshapen form. Cost control is a feature of decentralized, competitive markets, not of centralized bureaucracy—a matter of incentives, not mandates. What’s more, cost control is dynamic. Even the simplest business faces constant variation in its costs for labor, facilities, and capital; to compete, management must react quickly, efficiently, and, most often, prospectively. By contrast, government bureaucracies set regulations and reimbursement rates through carefully evaluated and broadly applied rules. These bureaucracies first must notice market changes and resource misallocations, and then (sometimes subject to political considerations) issue additional regulations or change reimbursement rates to address each problem retrospectively. As a result, strange distortions crop up constantly in health care. For example, although the population is rapidly aging, we have few geriatricians—physicians who address the cluster of common patient issues related to aging, often crossing traditional specialty lines. Why? Because under Medicare’s current reimbursement system (which generally pays more to physicians who do lots of tests and procedures), geriatricians typically don’t make much money. If seniors were the true customers, they would likely flock to geriatricians, bidding up their rates—and sending a useful signal to medical-school students. But Medicare is the real customer, and it pays more to specialists in established fields. And so, seniors often end up overusing specialists who are not focused on their specific health needs. Many reformers believe if we could only adopt a single-payer system, we could deliver health care more cheaply than we do today. The experience of other developed countries suggests that’s true: the government as single payer would have lower administrative costs than private insurers, as well as enormous market clout and the ability to bring down prices, although at the cost of explicitly rationing care. But even leaving aside the effects of price controls on innovation and customer service, today’s Medicare system should leave us skeptical about the long-term viability of that approach. From 2000 to 2007, despite its market power, Medicare’s hospital and physician reimbursements per enrollee rose by 5.4 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, per year. As currently structured, Medicare is a Ponzi scheme. The Medicare tax rate has been raised seven times since its enactment, and almost certainly will need to be raised again in the next decade. The Medicare tax contributions and premiums that today’s beneficiaries have paid into the system don’t come close to fully funding their care, which today’s workers subsidize. The subsidy is getting larger even as it becomes more difficult to maintain: next year there will be 3.7 working people for each Medicare beneficiary; if you’re in your mid-40s today, there will be only 2.4 workers to subsidize your care when you hit retirement age. The experience of other rich nations should also make us skeptical. Whatever their histories, nearly all developed countries are now struggling with rapidly rising health-care costs, including those with single-payer systems. From 2000 to 2005, per capita health-care spending in Canada grew by 33 percent, in France by 37 percent, in the U.K. by 47 percent—all comparable to the 40 percent growth experienced by the U.S. in that period. Cost control by way of bureaucratic price controls has its limits. In 2007, health companies in the Fortune 1,000 earned $71 billion. Of the 52 industries represented on Fortune’s list, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment ranked third and fourth, respectively, in terms of profits as a share of revenue. From 2000 to 2007, the annual profits of America’s top 15 health-insurance companies increased from $3.5 billion to $15 billion. In competitive markets, high profits serve an important social purpose: encouraging capital to flow to the production of a service not adequately supplied. But as long as our government shovels ever-greater resources into health care with one hand, while with the other restricting competition that would ensure those resources are used efficiently, sustained high profits will be the rule. Health care is an exceptionally heavily regulated industry. Health-insurance companies are regulated by states, which limits interstate competition. And many of the materials, machines, and even software programs used by health-care facilities must be licensed by state or federal authorities, or approved for use by Medicare; these requirements form large barriers to entry for both new facilities and new vendors that could equip and supply them. Many health-care regulations are justified as safety precautions. But many also result from attempts to redress the distortions that our system of financing health care has created. And whatever their purpose, almost all of these regulations can be shaped over time by the powerful institutions that dominate the health-care landscape, and that are often looking to protect themselves from competition. Take the ongoing battle between large integrated hospitals and specialty clinics (for cardiac surgery, orthopedics, maternity, etc.). The economic threat posed by these facilities is well illustrated by a recent battle in Loma Linda, California. When a group of doctors proposed a 28-bed private specialty facility, the local hospitals protested to the city council that it was unnecessary, and launched a publicity campaign to try to block it; the council backed the facility anyway. So the nonprofit Loma Linda University Medical Center simply bought the new facility for $80 million in 2008. Traditional hospitals got Congress to include an 18-month moratorium on new specialty hospitals in the 2003 Medicare law, and a second six-month ban in 2005. The hospitals’ argument has some merit: less complicated surgical cases (the kind specialty clinics typically take on) tend to be more profitable than complex surgeries and nonsurgical admissions. Without those profitable cases, hospitals can’t subsidize the cases on which they lose money. But why are simple surgeries more profitable? Because of the nonmarket methods by which Medicare sets prices. The net effect of the endless layers of health-care regulation is to stifle competition in the classic economic sense. What we have instead is a noncompetitive system where services and reimbursement are negotiated above consumers’ heads by large private and government institutions. And the primary goal of any large noncompetitive institution is not cost control or product innovation or customer service: it’s maintenance of the status quo. In 1751, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Thomas Bond founded Pennsylvania Hospital, the first in America, “to care for the sick-poor and insane who were wandering the streets of Philadelphia.” Since then, hospitals have come to dominate the American medical landscape. Yet in recent decades, the rationale for concentrating so much care under one roof has diminished steadily. Many hospitals still exist in their current form largely because they are protected by regulation and favored by government payment policies, which effectively maintain the existing industrial structure, rather than encouraging innovation. Between 1970 and 2006, annual Medicare payments to hospitals grew by roughly 3,800 percent, from $5 billion to $192 billion. Total annual hospital-care costs for all patients grew from $28 billion to almost $650 billion during that same period. Since 1975, hospitals’ enormous revenue growth has occurred despite a 35 percent decline in the number of hospital beds, no meaningful increase in total admissions, and an almost 50 percent decline in the average length of stay. High-tech equipment has been dispersed to medical practices, recovery periods after major procedures have shrunk, and pharmaceutical therapies have grown in importance, yet over the past 40 years, hospitals have managed to retain the same share (roughly one-third) of our nation’s health-care bill. Hospitals have sought to use the laws and regulations originally designed to serve patients to preserve their business model. Their argument is the same one that’s been made before by regulated railroads, electric utilities, airlines, Ma Bell, and banks: new competitors, they say, are using their cost advantages to skim off the best customers; without those customers, the incumbents will no longer be able to subsidize essential services that no one can profitably provide to the public. Hospitals are indeed required to provide emergency care to any walk-in patient, and this obligation is a meaningful public service. But how do we know whether the charitable benefit from this requirement justifies the social cost of expensive hospital care and poor quality? We don’t know. Our system of health-care law and regulation has so distorted the functioning of the market that it’s impossible to measure the social costs and benefits of maintaining hospitals’ prominence. And again, the distortions caused by a reluctance to pay directly for health care—in this case, emergency medicine for the poor—are in large part to blame. Consider the oft-quoted “statistic” that emergency-room care is the most expensive form of treatment. Has anyone who believes this ever actually been to an emergency room? My sister is an emergency-medicine physician; unlike most other specialists, ER docs usually work on scheduled shifts and are paid fixed salaries that place them in the lower ranks of physician compensation. The doctors and other workers are hardly underemployed: typically, ERs are unbelievably crowded. They have access to the facilities and equipment of the entire hospital, but require very few dedicated resources of their own. They benefit from the group buying power of the entire institution. No expensive art decorates the walls, and the waiting rooms resemble train-station waiting areas. So what exactly makes an ER more expensive than other forms of treatment? Perhaps it’s the accounting. Since charity care, which is often performed in the ER, is one justification for hospitals’ protected place in law and regulation, it’s in hospitals’ interest to shift costs from overhead and other parts of the hospital to the ER, so that the costs of charity care—the public service that hospitals are providing—will appear to be high. Hospitals certainly lose money on their ERs; after all, many of their customers pay nothing. But to argue that ERs are costly compared with other treatment options, hospitals need to claim expenses well beyond the marginal (or incremental) cost of serving ER patients. In a recent IRS survey of almost 500 nonprofit hospitals, nearly 60 percent reported providing charity care equal to less than 5 percent of their total revenue, and about 20 percent reported providing less than 2 percent. Analyzing data from the American Hospital Directory, The Wall Street Journal found that the 50 largest nonprofit hospitals or hospital systems made a combined “net income” (that is, profit) of $4.27 billion in 2006, nearly eight times their profits five years earlier. How do we know whether the value of hospitals’ charitable services compensates for the roughly 100,000 deaths from hospital-borne disease, their poor standards of customer service, and their extraordinary diseconomies of both scale and scope? Might we be better off reforming hospitals, and allowing many of them to be eliminated by competition from specialty clinics? As a society, couldn’t we just pay directly for the services required by the poor? We don’t know how many hospitals would even survive if they were not so favored under the law; anyone who has lost a loved one to a preventable hospital death will wonder how many should. What amazed me most during five weeks in the ICU with my dad was the survival of paper and pen for medical instructions and histories. In that time, Dad was twice taken for surgical procedures intended for other patients (fortunately interrupted both times by our intervention). My dry cleaner uses a more elaborate system to track shirts than this hospital used to track treatment. Not every hospital relies on paper-based orders and charts, but most still do. Why has adoption of clinical information technology been so slow? Companies invest in IT to reduce their costs, reduce mistakes (itself a form of cost-saving), and improve customer service. Better information technology would have improved my father’s experience in the ICU—and possibly his chances of survival. But my father was not the customer; Medicare was. And although Medicare has experimented with new reimbursement approaches to drive better results, no centralized reimbursement system can be supple enough to address the many variables affecting the patient experience. Certainly, Medicare wasn’t paying for the quality of service during my dad’s hospital stay. And it wasn’t really paying for the quality of his care, either; indeed, because my dad got sepsis in the hospital, and had to spend weeks there before his death, the hospital was able to charge a lot more for his care than if it had successfully treated his pneumonia and sent him home in days. Of course, one area of health-related IT has received substantial investment—billing. So much for the argument, often made, that privacy concerns or a lack of agreed-upon standards has prevented the development of clinical IT or electronic medical records; presumably, if lack of privacy or standards had hampered the digitization of health records, it also would have prevented the digitization of the accompanying bills. To meet the needs of the government bureaucracy and insurance companies, most providers now bill on standardized electronic forms. In case you wonder who a care provider’s real customer is, try reading one of these bills. For that matter, try discussing prices with hospitals and other providers. Eight years ago, my wife needed an MRI, but we did not have health insurance. I called up several area hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices—all within about a one-mile radius—to find the best price. I was surprised to discover that prices quoted, for an identical service, varied widely, and that the lowest price was $1,200. But what was truly astonishing was that several providers refused to quote any price. Only if I came in and actually ordered the MRI could we discuss price. Several years later, when we were preparing for the birth of our second child, I requested the total cost of the delivery and related procedures from our hospital. The answer: the hospital discussed price only with uninsured patients. What about my co-pay? They would discuss my potential co-pay only if I were applying for financial assistance. Keeping prices opaque is one way medical institutions seek to avoid competition and thereby keep prices up. And they get away with it in part because so few consumers pay directly for their own care—insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid are basically the whole game. But without transparency on prices—and the related data on measurable outcomes—efforts to give the consumer more control over health care have failed, and always will. Here’s a wonderful example of price opacity. Advocates for the uninsured complain that hospitals charge uninsured patients, on average, 2.5 times the amount charged to insured patients. Hospitals defend themselves by contending that they earn from uninsured patients only 25 percent of the amount they do from insured ones. Both statements appear to be true! How is this possible? Well, hospitals bill according to their price lists, but provide large discounts to major insurers. Individual consumers, of course, don’t benefit from these discounts, so they receive their bills at full list price (typically about 2.5 times the bill to an insured patient). Uninsured patients, however, pay according to how much of the bill the hospital believes they can afford (which, on average, amounts to 25 percent of the amount paid by an insured patient). Nonetheless, whatever discount a hospital gives to an uninsured patient is entirely at its discretion—and is typically negotiated only after the fact. Some uninsured patients have been driven into bankruptcy by hospital collections. American industry may offer no better example of pernicious “price discrimination,” nor one that entails greater financial vulnerability for American families. It’s astonishingly difficult for consumers to find any health-care information that would enable them to make informed choices—based not just on price, but on quality of care or the rate of preventable medical errors. Here’s one place where legal requirements might help. But only a few states require institutions to make this sort of information public in a usable form for consumers. So while every city has numerous guidebooks with reviews of schools, restaurants, and spas, the public is frequently deprived of the necessary data to choose hospitals and other providers. One of the most widely held pieces of conventional wisdom about health care is that new technology is relentlessly driving up costs. Yet over the past 20 years, I’ve bought several generations of microwave ovens, personal computers, DVD players, GPS devices, mobile phones, and flat-screen TVs. I bank mostly at ATMs, check out my own goods at self-serve supermarket scanners, and attend company meetings by video­conference. Technology has transformed much of our daily lives, in almost all cases by adding quantity, speed, and quality while lowering costs. So why is health care different? Well, for the most part, it isn’t. Whether it’s new drugs to control previously untreatable conditions, diagnostic equipment that enhances physician productivity, or minimally invasive techniques that speed patient recovery, technology-driven innovation has been transforming care at least as greatly as it has transformed the rest of our lives. But most health-care technologies don’t exist in the same world as other technologies. Recall the MRI my wife needed a few years ago: $1,200 for 20 minutes’ use of a then 20-year-old technology, requiring a little electricity and a little labor from a single technician and a radiologist. Why was the price so high? Most MRIs in this country are reimbursed by insurance or Medicare, and operate in the limited-competition, nontransparent world of insurance pricing. I don’t even know the price of many of the diagnostic services I’ve needed over the years—usually I’ve just gone to whatever provider my physician recommended, without asking (my personal contribution to the moral-hazard economy). By contrast, consider LASIK surgery. I still lack the (small amount of) courage required to get LASIK. But I’ve been considering it since it was introduced commercially in the 1990s. The surgery is seldom covered by insurance, and exists in the competitive economy typical of most other industries. So people who get LASIK surgery—or for that matter most cosmetic surgeries, dental procedures, or other mostly uninsured treatments—act like consumers. If you do an Internet search today, you can find LASIK procedures quoted as low as $499 per eye—a decline of roughly 80 percent since the procedure was introduced. You’ll also find sites where doctors advertise their own higher-priced surgeries (which more typically cost about $2,000 per eye) and warn against the dangers of discount LASIK. Many ads specify the quality of equipment being used and the performance record of the doctor, in addition to price. In other words, there’s been an active, competitive market for LASIK surgery of the same sort we’re used to seeing for most goods and services. The history of LASIK fits well with the pattern of all capital-intensive services outside the health-insurance economy. If you’re one of the first ophthalmologists in your community to perform the procedure, you can charge a high price. But once you’ve acquired the machine, the actual cost of performing a single procedure (the marginal cost) is relatively low. So, as additional ophthalmologists in the neighborhood invest in LASIK equipment, the first provider can meet new competition by cutting price. In a fully competitive marketplace, the procedure’s price will tend toward that low marginal cost, and ophthalmologists looking to buy new machines will exert downward pressure on both equipment and procedure prices. No business likes to compete solely on price, so most technology providers seek to add features and performance improvements to new generations of a machine—anything to keep their product from becoming a pure commodity. Their success depends on whether the consumers will pay enough for the new feature to justify its introduction. In most consumer industries, we can see this dynamic in action—observe how DVD players have moved in a few years from a high-priced luxury to a disposable commodity available at discount stores. DVD players have run out of new features for which customers will pay premium prices. Perhaps MRIs have too. After a long run of high and stable prices, you can now find ads for discount MRIs. But because of the peculiar way we pay for health care, this downward price pressure on technology seems less vigorous. How well can insurance companies and government agencies judge the value of new features that tech suppliers introduce to keep prices up? Rather than blaming technology for rising costs, we must ask if moral hazard and a lack of discipline in national health-care spending allows health-care companies to avoid the forces that make nonmedical technology so competitive. In 2002, the U.S. had almost six times as many CT scanners per capita as Germany and four times as many MRI machines as the U.K. Traditional reformers believe it is this rate of investment that has pushed up prices, rather than sustained high prices that have pushed up investment. As a result, many states now require hospitals to obtain a Certificate of Need before making a major equipment purchase. In its own twisted way, this makes sense: moral hazard, driven by insurance, for years allowed providers to create enough demand to keep new MRI machines humming at any price. But Certificates of Need are just another Scotch-tape reform, an effort to maintain the current system by treating a symptom rather than the underlying disease. Technology is driving up the cost of health care for the same reason every other factor of care is driving up the cost—the absence of the forces that discipline and even drive down prices in the rest of our economy. Only in the bizarre parallel universe of health care could limiting supply be seen as a sensible approach to keeping prices down. A wasteful insurance system; distorted incentives; a bias toward treatment; moral hazard; hidden costs and a lack of transparency; curbed competition; service to the wrong customer. These are the problems at the foundation of our health-care system, resulting in a slow rot and requiring more and more money just to keep the system from collapsing. How would the health-care reform that’s now taking shape solve these core problems? The Obama administration and Congress are still working out the details, but it looks like this generation of “comprehensive” reform will not address the underlying issues, any more than previous efforts did. Instead it will put yet more patches on the walls of an edifice that is fundamentally unsound—and then build that edifice higher. A central feature of the reform plan is the expansion of comprehensive health insurance to most of the 46 million Americans who now lack private or public insurance. Whether this would be achieved entirely through the extension of private commercial insurance at government-subsidized rates, or through the creation of a “public option,” perhaps modeled on Medicare, is still being debated. Regardless, the administration has suggested a cost to taxpayers of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That, of course, will mean another $1 trillion or more not spent on other things—environment, education, nutrition, recreation. And if the history of previous attempts to expand the health safety net are any guide, that estimate will prove low. The reform plan will also feature a variety of centrally administered initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve quality. These will likely include a major government investment to promote digitization of patient health records, an effort to collect information on best clinical practices, and changes in the way providers are paid, to better reward quality and deter wasteful spending. All of these initiatives have some theoretical appeal. And within the confines of the current system, all may do some good. But for the most part, they simply do not address the root causes of poor quality and runaway costs. Consider information technology, for instance. Of course the health system could benefit from better use of IT. The Rand Corporation has estimated that the widespread use of electronic medical records would eventually yield annual savings of $81 billion, while also improving care and reducing preventable deaths, and the White House estimates that creating and spreading the technology would cost just $50 billion. But in what other industry would an investment with such a massive annual return not be funded by the industry itself? (And while $50 billion may sound like a big investment, it’s only about 2 percent of the health-care industry’s annual revenues.) Technology is effective only when it’s properly applied. Since most physicians and health-care companies haven’t adopted electronic medical records on their own, what makes us think they will appropriately use all this new IT? Most of the benefits of the technology (record portability, a reduction in costly and dangerous clinical errors) would likely accrue to patients, not providers. In a consumer-facing industry, this alone would drive companies to make the investments to stay competitive. But of course, we patients aren’t the real customers; government funding of electronic records wouldn’t change that. I hope that whatever reform is finally enacted this fall works—preventing people from slipping through the cracks, raising the quality standard of the health-care industry, and delivering all this at acceptable cost. But looking at the big picture, I fear it won’t. So I think we should at least begin to debate and think about larger reforms, and a different direction—if not for this round of reform, then for the next one. Politics is, of course, the art of the possible. If our health-care crisis does not abate, the possibilities for reform may expand beyond their current, tight limits. The most important single step we can take toward truly reforming our system is to move away from comprehensive health insurance as the single model for financing care. And a guiding principle of any reform should be to put the consumer, not the insurer or the government, at the center of the system. I believe if the government took on the goal of better supporting consumers—by bringing greater transparency and competition to the health-care industry, and by directly subsidizing those who can’t afford care—we’d find that consumers could buy much more of their care directly than we might initially think, and that over time we’d see better care and better service, at lower cost, as a result. A more consumer-centered health-care system would not rely on a single form of financing for health-care purchases; it would make use of different sorts of financing for different elements of care—with routine care funded largely out of our incomes; major, predictable expenses (including much end-of-life care) funded by savings and credit; and massive, unpredictable expenses funded by insurance. For years, a number of reformers have advocated a more “consumer-driven” care system—a term coined by the Harvard Business School professor Regina Herzlinger, who has written extensively on the subject. Many different steps could move us toward such a system. Here’s one approach that—although it may sound radical—makes sense to me. First, we should replace our current web of employer- and government-based insurance with a single program of catastrophic insurance open to all Americans—indeed, all Americans should be required to buy it—with fixed premiums based solely on age. This program would be best run as a single national pool, without underwriting for specific risk factors, and would ultimately replace Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. All Americans would be insured against catastrophic illness, throughout their lives. Proposals for true catastrophic insurance usually founder on the definition of catastrophe. So much of the amount we now spend is dedicated to problems that are considered catastrophic, the argument goes, that a separate catastrophic system is pointless. A typical catastrophic insurance policy today might cover any expenses above, say, $2,000. That threshold is far too low; ultimately, a threshold of $50,000 or more would be better. (Chronic conditions with expected annual costs above some lower threshold would also be covered.) We might consider other mechanisms to keep total costs down: the plan could be required to pay out no more in any year than its available premiums, for instance, with premium increases limited to the general rate of inflation. But the real key would be to restrict the coverage to true catastrophes—if this approach is to work, only a minority of us should ever be beneficiaries. How would we pay for most of our health care? The same way we pay for everything else—out of our income and savings. Medicare itself is, in a sense, a form of forced savings, as is commercial insurance. In place of these programs and the premiums we now contribute to them, and along with catastrophic insurance, the government should create a new form of health savings account—a vehicle that has existed, though in imperfect form, since 2003. Every American should be required to maintain an HSA, and contribute a minimum percentage of post-tax income, subject to a floor and a cap in total dollar contributions. The income percentage required should rise over a working life, as wages and wealth typically do. All noncatastrophic care should eventually be funded out of HSAs. But account-holders should be allowed to withdraw money for any purpose, without penalty, once the funds exceed a ceiling established for each age, and at death any remaining money should be disbursed through inheritance. Our current methods of health-care funding create a “use it or lose it” imperative. This new approach would ensure that families put aside funds for future expenses, but would not force them to spend the funds only on health care. What about care that falls through the cracks—major expenses (an appendectomy, sports injury, or birth) that might exceed the current balance of someone’s HSA but are not catastrophic? These should be funded the same way we pay for most expensive purchases that confer long-term benefits: with credit. Americans should be able to borrow against their future contributions to their HSA to cover major health needs; the government could lend directly, or provide guidelines for private lending. Catastrophic coverage should apply with no deductible for young people, but as people age and save, they should pay a steadily increasing deductible from their HSA, unless the HSA has been exhausted. As a result, much end-of-life care would be paid through savings. Anyone with whom I discuss this approach has the same question: How am I supposed to be able to afford health care in this system? Well, what if I gave you $1.77 million? Recall, that’s how much an insured 22-year-old at my company could expect to pay—and to have paid on his and his family’s behalf—over his lifetime, assuming health-care costs are tamed. Sure, most of that money doesn’t pass through your hands now. It’s hidden in company payments for premiums, or in Medicare taxes and premiums. But think about it: If you had access to those funds over your lifetime, wouldn’t you be able to afford your own care? And wouldn’t you consume health care differently if you and your family didn’t have to spend that money only on care? For lower-income Americans who can’t fund all of their catastrophic premiums or minimum HSA contributions, the government should fill the gap—in some cases, providing all the funding. You don’t think we spend an absurd amount of money on health care? If we abolished Medicaid, we could spend the same money to make a roughly $3,000 HSA contribution and a $2,000 catastrophic-premium payment for 60 million Americans every year. That’s a $12,000 annual HSA plus catastrophic coverage for a low-income family of four. Do we really believe most of them wouldn’t be better off? Some experts worry that requiring people to pay directly for routine care would cause some to put off regular checkups. So here’s a solution: the government could provide vouchers to all Americans for a free checkup every two years. If everyone participated, the annual cost would be about $30 billion—a small fraction of the government’s current spending on care. Today, insurance covers almost all health-care expenditures. The few consumers who pay from their pockets are simply an afterthought for most providers. Imagine how things might change if more people were buying their health care the way they buy anything else. I’m certain that all the obfuscation over prices would vanish pretty quickly, and that we’d see an end to unreadable bills. And that physicians, who spend an enormous amount of time on insurance-related paperwork, would have more time for patients. In fact, as a result of our fraying insurance system, you can already see some nascent features of a consumer-centered system. Since 2006, Wal-Mart has offered $4 prescriptions for a month’s supply of common generic medications. It has also been slowly rolling out retail clinics for routine care such as physicals, blood work, and treatment for common ailments like strep throat. Prices for each service are easily obtained; most are in the neighborhood of $50 to $80. Likewise, “concierge care,” or the “boutique” style of medical practice—in which physicians provide unlimited services and fast appointments in return for a fixed monthly or annual fee—is beginning to spread from the rich to the middle class. Qliance Medical Group, for instance, now operates clinics serving some 3,000 patients in the Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, areas, charging $49 to $79 a month for unlimited primary care, defined expansively. It’s worth pausing over this last example. Many experts believe that the U.S. would get better health outcomes at lower cost if payment to providers were structured around the management of health or whole episodes of care, instead of through piecemeal fees. Medicare and private insurers have, to various degrees, moved toward (or at least experimented with) these sorts of payments, and are continuing to do so—but slowly, haltingly, and in the face of much obstruction by providers. But aren’t we likely to see just these sorts of payment mechanisms develop organically in a consumer-centered health-care system? For simplicity and predictability, many people will prefer to pay a fixed monthly or annual fee for primary or chronic care, and providers will move to serve that demand. Likewise, what patient, when considering getting an artificial hip, would want to deal with a confusion of multiple bills from physicians, facilities, and physical therapists? Aren’t providers likely to organize themselves to provide a single price to the consumer for care and rehabilitation? And won’t that, in itself, put pressure on providers to work together as efficiently as possible, and to minimize the medical errors that would eat into their joint fee? I suspect we would see a rapid decline in the predominance of the fee-for-service model, making way for real innovation and choice in service plans and funding. And the payment system would not be set by fiat; it would remain responsive to treatment breakthroughs and changes in consumer demand. Many consumers would be able to make many decisions, unaided, in such a system. But we’d also probably see the rise of health-care agents—paid by, and responsible to, the consumer—to help choose providers and to act as advocates during long and complex care episodes. How else might the system change? Technological innovation—which is now almost completely insensitive to costs, and which often takes the form of slightly improved treatments for much higher prices—would begin to concern itself with value, not just quality. Many innovations might drive prices down, not up. Convenient, lower-cost specialty centers might proliferate. The need for unpaid indigent care would go away—everyone, recall, would have both catastrophic insurance and an HSA, funded entirely by the government when necessary—and with it much of the rationale for protecting hospitals against competition. Of course, none of this would happen overnight. And the government has an essential role to play in arming consumers with good information. Congress should require maximum transparency on services, prices, and results (and some elements of the Obama administration’s reform plan would move the industry in this direction). We should establish a more comprehensive system of quality inspection of all providers, and publish all the findings. Safety and efficacy must remain the cornerstone of government licensing, but regulatory bias should favor competition and prevent incumbents from using red tape to forestall competition. Moving from the system we’ve got now to the one I’ve outlined would be complicated, and would take a long time. Most of us have been paying into an insurance system for years, expecting that our future health-care bills would be paid; we haven’t been saving separately for these expenses. It would take a full generation to completely migrate from relying on Medicare to saving for late-life care; from Medicaid for the disadvantaged to catastrophic insurance and subsidized savings accounts. Such a transition would require the slow reduction of Medicare taxes, premiums, and benefit levels for those not yet eligible, and a corresponding slow ramp-up in HSAs. And the national catastrophic plan would need to start with much broader coverage and higher premiums than the ultimate goal, in order to fund the care needed today by our aging population. Nonetheless, the benefits of a consumer-centered approach—lower costs for better service—should have early and large dividends for all of us throughout the period of transition. The earlier we start, the less a transition will ultimately cost. Many experts oppose the whole concept of a greater role for consumers in our health-care system. They worry that patients lack the necessary knowledge to be good consumers, that unscrupulous providers will take advantage of them, that they will overspend on low-benefit treatments and under-spend on high-benefit preventive care, and that such waste will leave some patients unable to afford highly beneficial care. They are right, of course. Whatever replaces our current system will be flawed; that’s the nature of health care and, indeed, of all human institutions. Our current system features all of these problems already—as does the one the Obama reforms would create. Because health care is so complex and because each individual has a unique health profile, no system can be perfect. I believe my proposed approach passes two meaningful tests. It will do a better job than our current system of controlling prices, allocating resources, expanding access, and safeguarding quality. And it will do a better job than a more government-driven approach of harnessing medicine’s dynamism to develop and spread the new knowledge, technologies, and techniques that improve the quality of life. We won’t be perfect consumers, but we’re more likely than large bureaucracies to encourage better medicine over time. All of the health-care interest groups—hospitals, insurance companies, professional groups, pharmaceuticals, device manufacturers, even advocates for the poor—have a major stake in the current system. Overturning it would favor only the 300 million of us who use the system and—whether we realize it or not—pay for it. Until we start asking the type of questions my father’s death inspired me to ask, until we demand the same price and quality accountability in health care that we demand in everything else, each new health-care reform will cost us more and serve us less. Ten days after my father’s death, the hospital sent my mother a copy of the bill for his five-week stay: $636,687.75. He was charged $11,590 per night for his ICU room; $7,407 per night for a semiprivate room before he was moved to the ICU; $145,432 for drugs; $41,696 for respiratory services. Even the most casual effort to compare these prices to marginal costs or to the costs of off-the-shelf components demonstrates the absurdity of these numbers, but why should my mother care? Her share of the bill was only $992; the balance, undoubtedly at some huge discount, was paid by Medicare. Wasn’t this an extraordinary benefit, a windfall return on American citizenship? Or at least some small relief for a distraught widow? Not really. You can feel grateful for the protection currently offered by Medicare (or by private insurance) only if you don’t realize how much you truly spend to fund this system over your lifetime, and if you believe you’re getting good care in return. Would our health-care system be so outrageously expensive if each American family directly spent even half of that $1.77 million that it will contribute to health insurance and Medicare over a lifetime, instead of entrusting care to massive government and private intermediaries? Like its predecessors, the Obama administration treats additional government funding as a solution to unaffordable health care, rather than its cause. The current reform will likely expand our government’s already massive role in health-care decision-making—all just to continue the illusion that someone else is paying for our care. But let’s forget about money for a moment. Aren’t we also likely to get worse care in any system where providers are more accountable to insurance companies and government agencies than to us? Before we further remove ourselves as direct consumers of health care—with all of our beneficial influence on quality, service, and price—let me ask you to consider one more question. Imagine my father’s hospital had to present the bill for his “care” not to a government bureaucracy, but to my grieving mother. Do you really believe that the hospital—forced to face the victim of its poor-quality service, forced to collect the bill from the real customer—wouldn’t have figured out how to make its doctors wash their hands?",SEPTEMBER 2009 ISSUE
Why I Had to Close My Preventive Healthcare Clinic - The Atlantic,11430,"On December 27, I closed MDPrevent, the preventive-medical practice that I co-founded three years ago in Delray Beach, Florida. The practice was created with the premise that patients would be better off if doctors focused their attention more on preventing disease than simply treating it. In clinical parlance, “primary prevention” means preventing disease occurrence, while “secondary prevention” means early diagnosis and treatment of existing disease before it causes significant harm. The thrust of MDPrevent was primary prevention: to help patients identify their risk factors for the major chronic diseases and leading killers, such as diabetes, heart and lung disease, stroke, and cancer, and to help them make lifestyle changes to prevent these factors from evolving to illness. I focused on lifestyle counseling, rather than diagnostic tests meant for early detection. But ultimately, the three major healthcare industry players—the providers, the payers, and the patients—all shared some responsibility for our failure. Some may say that most start-ups fail. But what happened to MDPrevent is a cautionary tale. My incentives for creating this new model were more altruistic than financial. I previously cofounded, built, and sold a successful healthcare-services company. After spending years involved with the care of institutionalized elderly past the point where prevention makes any real difference, my ultimate goal became demonstrating that doctors could afford to focus on prevention without sacrificing their livelihoods. Of course, to start focusing on primary prevention, most doctors would have to undergo further re-education, as few have training in nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, and the like. MDPrevent realized this and assembled a team that included a health psychologist, registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, yoga instructor, health educator, and nurse practitioners. Our system was predicated on an integrated model of care in which the physician would complete an initial thorough health risk assessment, make appropriate internal and external referrals, and then monitor progress by reviewing records and periodically meeting with the patient. In addition to personalized care, our custom facility, which included a teaching kitchen, a gym, and classrooms, allowed us to also offer our patients group classes focused on healthy cooking, exercise, nutritional therapy, diabetes education, and mindfulness meditation. We knew that for the model to be scalable, it had to be based on insurance reimbursement rather than out-of-pocket payments. We hoped that once we demonstrated the value of primary prevention in a setting that derived its revenue primarily from insurance, the rest of the medical establishment would see the merit and follow suit. Of course, in my mind, at that point we would also be well along in creating our own successful financial endeavor based on the premise of doing well by doing good. First, the good news: On the personal front, after reading 50 books and more than 30,000 abstracts and studies, I reversed my own health issues. I dropped 25 pounds, brought my cholesterol under 200 and stopped taking medication for it, eliminated my irritable bowel syndrome and heartburn, markedly decreased my left hip osteoarthritic pain, and started running again for the first time in 10 years. On the practice side, more than 1,000 patients came through our doors. Many people told us they loved the program, and we received many positive testimonials. Dozens of our patients sustained marked weight loss without drugs, supplements, or surgery. We successfully discontinued our patients’ statins, lowered or discontinued blood pressure and blood sugar medications, and watched people finally take control of their health. We religiously followed an insurance-based reimbursement model. We lost money. The bad news was that for every dollar we collected, our expenses equaled three dollars. I didn’t need my MBA to know that this was unsustainable, so I started cutting our costs. At the end, we were left with a health psychologist, a registered dietitian, and me. Even though I never took a paycheck, the Medicare reimbursement we received for our services still could not cover our costs. I even abandoned the offices we had built-out and moved to less expensive quarters we shared with an internist. It still made no difference. So what had gone wrong? First, few primary care and internal medicine doctors would refer to us. When I first met with a few dozen of them to introduce myself and the model, they raved about the concept and assured me they would make referrals. They said there was nothing like us, and they were right. Yet, other than for a small handful, they did not refer. When I asked several of these doctors why they had not referred, the most common explanation was that they simply forgot, or that they had made a referral, but their patients chose to not come. Some local specialists told us they would not refer to us because of fears of offending their primary care and internal medicine referral sources. The hospitals were no better. One local hospital initially asked us to open a Certified Diabetes Education Center because the hospital was shutting down its own program for financial reasons. As opening the center was consistent with our educational focus, we exerted much time and money to get certified so we would be open by the time the hospital shut down its program. The hospital initially told us they would refer diabetics to us, but then someone reversed the decision and the hospital decided to refer to its sister hospital instead. We also met with another local hospital and asked them to allow us to incorporate our prevention model into their primary care practice, and they also turned us down. Then there were the payer problems. Most of the third-party insurance companies in the area did not cover our services at all. Medicare was the exception, but reimbursement was insufficient to cover our costs. Although the Affordable Care Act included provisions to reimburse for services such as an Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) and Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity (IBTO), Medicare still paid less for such visits than other appointments of a similar length. As a result, many doctors told me that they had simply started lumping the AWV with a scheduled medical visit, often spending less than 15 minutes on a service that, when done right, could easily exceed an hour. We also approached the larger Medicare managed care companies, thinking that they would embrace our model as a way to save money on hospitalizations, prescriptions, emergency care, and specialist doctor visits. One small insurance company did contract with us in 2013, and not a single one of their patients needed a hospital visit after seeing us all year. We attribute that to the fact that each patient was offered, and most took advantage of, no-cost nutritional and psychological counseling. The other companies rejected us, and we were told by their representatives that they did not want to threaten or dilute their existing doctor relationships. But the final, and possibly most important, factor was a Medicare contracted audit we went through. A few months ago, we received a letter requesting we submit records for services we rendered and billed for Intensive Behavior Therapy for Obesity (IBTO). This new service introduced by CMS in 2012, allows doctors and nurse practitioners to provide obesity counseling to patients who qualify with a body mass index over 30. The service involves 15-minute weight-loss counseling sessions, for which Medicare reimburses about $25. Meanwhile, 15 minutes of any other kind of medical counseling is reimbursed by Medicare at about $75. Based on our cost structure, by the time we finished paying for the costs of the provider and the overhead, we were losing about $25 for every 15-minute visit. If we had billed $75 instead, we would have netted $25. So imagine our shock when we received a letter from a Medicare sub-contractor informing us that we would need to submit to a record review. After submitting our records, we were told that our claims were inappropriate. When we questioned the results, the response was that the records indicated that the obesity-counseling service had been mostly provided by a registered dietitian instead of a physician or nurse practitioner, as required. When we responded that we had used a registered dietitian under Medicare’s “incident to” rule, which allows a licensed professional to take over for a physician after the initial physician visit, the reviewer claimed she wasn’t aware of this Medicare provision. Eventually, we spoke with her supervisor, who told us that if I had co-signed the records, they would have been approved. But when we explained that the rules did not require a signature, she concurred. She advised us that the denial would probably be overturned during the mandated appeal process, but since they had already completed their review, there was nothing more she could do. In a last-ditch effort, we told them the following: MDPrevent was the largest provider of IBTO in Florida and had only billed all year a total of approximately $35,000 for the procedure. We further explained that this low amount, which led to losses for us, was why few others were providing the service. National statistics suggested that we may have provided the service more frequently than any other doctor in the U.S., even though it was not financially worthwhile. But now, we were being asked to potentially refund the little money we did get paid. The supervisor agreed to consult with CMS. Eight weeks later, we have yet to hear back from her. Nevertheless, the audit convinced us it was time to call it quits. The final contributors to our demise were the patients themselves. Primary prevention requires work: making better food choices, adding more physical activity, engaging in meaningful activities, and developing tools to better manage stress. Based on our review of the credible research, our model mostly excluded dietary supplements and multivitamins because the science mostly did not support their use. When it came to pharmaceuticals, we didn’t rush to prescribe if there were a non-drug alternative. This approach was a turn-off to many patients who expected a prescription or emphatically clung to beliefs in supplements. And the no-cost, no-deductible, no co-payment provisions in Medicare’s preventive benefits may have had an adverse effect on people’s sense of its value. How much would you appreciate something that has no cost to you? For many patients, it seemed easier to take supplements than to be more attentive to food labels and exercise habits. So after losing $2 million, yet reaping heartfelt thanks from patients who benefited from us, I have hung up my stethoscope. Patients loved my practice because I was willing to spend up to two full hours with them, most of it not reimbursed by insurance. The extra time often meant successfully making a diagnosis that had eluded other doctors for many years. It takes a very long time to get a thorough history and do a good exam and almost no time to prescribe a medication for a presumed illness. I chose the former. Insurance pays for the latter. Unfortunately, we still have a healthcare system that makes money by treating disease, rather than by preventing it.","JANUARY 13, 2014"
How Women's ‘Health-Care Gaslighting’ Went Mainstream - The Atlantic,10432,"After a while, the true-life horror stories women tell about their struggles to get reproductive health care start to bleed together. They almost always feature some variation on the same character: the doctor who waves a hand and says, “You’ll be fine,” or “That’s just in your head,” or “Take a Tylenol.” They follow an ominous three-act structure, in which a woman expresses concern about a sexual or reproductive issue to a doctor; the doctor demurs; later, after either an obstacle course of doctor visits or a nightmare scenario coming to life, a physician at last acknowledges her pain was real and present the whole time. Sometimes there’s a quietly gloomy boyfriend or husband in a secondary-character role, frustrated by the strain his partner’s health issue is putting on their intimacy. That many women have stories of medical practitioners dismissing, misdiagnosing, or cluelessly shrugging at their pain is, unfortunately, nothing new. Research cited in the Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics in 2001, for example, indicated that women get prescribed less pain medication than men after identical procedures (controlling for body size), are less likely to be admitted to hospitals and receive stress tests when they complain of chest pain, and are significantly more likely than men to be “undertreated” for pain by doctors. And there’s a multi-million dollar industry of questionable alternative health remedies that was arguably built at least in part on a history of doctors being dismissive toward women’s bodily health. How doctors take women's pain less seriously But in 2018, these stories of neglect and unhelpfulness within women’s health care, especially women’s sexual and reproductive health care, are bubbling up to the surface—being documented, circulated, and acknowledged by public discourse—in curious abundance. It started early in the year. In January, a widely cited Vogue cover story on the tennis great Serena Williams, who gave birth to a daughter in September of 2017, told the harrowing tale of how Williams had to urgently insist to the hospital staff in her recovery room that what she was experiencing after her C-section was a pulmonary embolism in order to get the treatment she needed to stay alive. “The nurse thought her pain medicine might be making her confused,” the story reads. A month later, Vogue published an essay by the Girls creator Lena Dunham on her choice to have a hysterectomy at age 31 to end her struggle with what she understood to be endometriosis. “I had to work so hard to have my pain acknowledged,” she writes. “And while I’ve been battling endometriosis for a decade and this will be my ninth surgical procedure, no doctor has ever confirmed this for me.” After her uterus is removed and she wakes up in a recovery room, she writes, the doctors are eager to tell her she was right: her uterus is “worse than anyone could have imagined.” Then, in April, The New York Times published Linda Villarosa’s revealing report on the dangerous endeavor of being black and pregnant in America, a phenomenon partly attributed to medical practitioners’ “dismissal of legitimate concerns and symptoms.” The story’s primary character, 23-year-old New Orleans mother of two, Simone Landrum, recalls being told by a doctor to calm down and take Tylenol when she complained of headaches during a particularly exhausting pregnancy; those headaches were later found to be caused by pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure and can result in the placenta separating from the uterus before the baby is born. This happened to Landrum, and her pregnancy ended in a stillbirth. The stories kept coming. Netflix’s The Bleeding Edge, a documentary released last month, is primarily about the poor testing of many medical devices on the market, but it nonetheless also functions as an indictment of carelessness toward women’s health at the regulatory-body level. Three of the four primary narratives  are about medical devices hastily approved by the FDA and marketed to women as safe, easy solutions for fertility- and childbirth-related issues. One prominently featured woman whose medical device—the birth-control implant Essure—lands her in the hospital so many times she loses her job, her home, and her kids over the course of the documentary, recalls being told by a doctor that her abnormally heavy, persistent vaginal bleeding after its insertion is “because she’s Latina” and that her problems are all in her head. The new KCRW podcast Bodies, a series about medical mysteries in women’s health that launched in July, kicked off its run with the story of a woman in her twenties who experiences deep, burning pain during sex and is initially told by a doctor that nothing’s wrong, lots of women have pain during sex, and that she should just wait and it’ll probably go away. After getting a referral for a specialist from a friend who visited 20 doctors over the course of  seven years before getting a diagnosis, she’s diagnosed with and successfully treated for a type of vulvodynia—which the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology describes as “common” (though “rarely diagnosed”). Sasha Ottey calls this phenomenon “health-care gaslighting.” Ottey founded the Atlanta-based nonprofit PCOS Challenge: The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association in 2009 to raise awareness of PCOS, a hormonal disorder affecting the ovaries that’s often linked to infertility, diabetes, and pelvic pain. Despite the fact that PCOS was first identified and researched in 1935 and the CDC has estimated it affects some 6 to 12 percent of adult women in the United States, many doctors still don’t recognize the symptoms. Women with PCOS and similar conditions like endometriosis and uterine fibroids, Ottey says, “have been told to suffer in silence.” Additionally, because PCOS often causes obesity or weight problems, many women with PCOS experience not just sexism but what Ottey calls “weight bias” in the health-care system. “Many women and young girls are told, ‘Oh, it's all in your head. Just eat less and exercise more,’” says Ottey, who herself recalls being initially instructed by an endocrinologist to lose weight and come back in six months. “People who are following an eating plan and present their diaries to their physicians or nutritionists will be told, ‘You left something off. You're lying. You're not doing enough.’” When missed periods are a metabolic problem Ottey, who spearheaded the PCOS Challenge’s first-ever day of advocacy on Capitol Hill in May, has noted the recent shift in how—and where—women talk about their struggles getting the sexual and reproductive health care they need. “We're at a critical juncture in women's health, where women are now feeling more empowered to speak up. Because frankly, we're frustrated,” she says. “We're frustrated with the type of care that we've gotten. We're frustrated that it sometimes takes someone decades to get a diagnosis. It's been a year, or a few years, of being empowered and emboldened."" Katherine Sherif, an internist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and the director of the hospital’s women’s primary care unit, says she hears “day in and day out” from patients “about how they are not listened to [by other doctors], how they’re blown off, how a clue was missed.” Sherif believes most of the minimization of women’s health concerns is “unconscious” on the part of both male and female doctors, but blames general societal sexism for the gaps in women’s sexual and reproductive health care. Men with sexual and reproductive dysfunction have to fight for the care they need sometimes too, she points out, but “to a lesser extent” from what she’s seen. In her 23 years practicing medicine, Sherif has received a lot of thank-you notes from women she’s treated—and “they don’t say ‘Thank you for saving my life’ or ‘Thank you for that great diagnosis,’” she says. “They say, ‘Thank you for listening to me.’ Or ‘I know we couldn’t get to the bottom of it, but thank you for being there.’” So Sherif sees a common theme in the recent flurry of high-profile expressions of disappointment in women’s reproductive health care, feminist protests against President Donald Trump, and the #MeToo movement: All three, she says, result from women feeling that their complaints, concerns, and objections aren’t being listened to. “Perhaps it parallels what’s changing in our society,” Sherif says. “When we shine a light in those dirty, dark corners, I think it may give us courage to shed light on other things.” Ottey, meanwhile, believes women’s increasing candor about their health- and health care-related frustrations can be traced back to the advent of social media. Ottey describes her own struggle to finally get a diagnosis and a treatment plan for PCOS in 2008 as one that made her feel “absolutely alone,” but in the years since, she says, she’s seen women with similar conditions and complaints find and support each other on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. “Women see other women, and other girls, speaking up,” she says. Ottey’s social-media strength-in-numbers theory is borne out in The Bleeding Edge, too: Women whose health deteriorated after getting the Essure birth-control device implanted eventually created an advocacy campaign after finding each other through a Facebook group launched in 2011. Thirty-five thousand women had joined by the time The Bleeding Edge was filmed. Angie Firmalino, the Facebook group’s founder, remembers being surprised at how many women quickly joined the group, despite it being a project she’d started just so she could warn her female friends about the device. “We became a support group for each other,” Firmalino says, as a montage of selfie videos women have posted to the group page play onscreen. “The day I was implanted, I left the hospital and I was in pain,” says one woman. “They told me to take some ibuprofen and it’ll get better,” says another. When Firmalino researched the process by which Essure was approved for sale and implantation, she found the FDA hearings had been videotaped, but the video company that owned the tapes would only release them to her for several hundred dollars. So she posted on the Facebook group asking for donations to buy the video—clips of which are repurposed in the documentary and account for its most chilling moments. They raised $900 in 15 minutes.","AUGUST 10, 2018"
The States With the Worst Healthcare Systems - The Atlantic,3243,"Minnesota has the nation's best-performing healthcare system, according to a Commonwealth Fund ranking released this week, and Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire are tied for second. Mississippi ranks last, just as it did on the previous ranking in 2009. Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas round out the bottom of the list. For the ranking, the Commonwealth Fund relied on 42 different metrics that gauged everything from insurance coverage to avoidable hospital stays to vaccination rates, at the systemic level; and from obesity rates to how many adults have lost six or more teeth, at the individual level. Here's the tooth map: Almost all states either stagnated or declined in performance since the survey was performed five years ago, and once again, Southern states scored especially poorly across all of the dimensions. What's more, there were wide mortality differences between black and white residents of several states in the Deep South. ""Racial and ethnic minorities in Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina faced some of widest disparities relative to the national average across all of the indicators assessed in our Equity dimension,"" the group wrote. Demographically, Mississippi is already at a disadvantage. A black man in Mississippi has a shorter life expectancy than the average American did in 1960. The state has an obesity rate of 35 percent, one of the highest poverty rates in the country, and just one abortion clinic. Healthcare in Mississippi and in other Southern states is unlikely to become more equitable anytime soon, however. As the study authors note, 16 of the states in the bottom half of the ranking have opted not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In Mississippi, for example, ""Medicaid eligibility for non-disabled adults is limited to parents with incomes below 29 percent of poverty, or about $6,800 a year for a family of four, and adults without dependent children remain ineligible regardless of their income,"" as the Kaiser Family Foundation points out. Those Mississippians making between 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or $23,850 for a family of four, and 400 percent, can qualify for subsidies to buy health insurance on the exchanges. But 30 percent of uninsured Mississippians fall into the ""coverage gap"" between the state's current income cutoff for Medicaid and the federal cutoff for health insurance subsidies. They don't qualify for any kind of financial help to buy health insurance and are likely to remain uninsured. Mississippi also had the largest percentage of adults who went without medical care because of cost issues, according to the Commonwealth Fund report. In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association yesterday, the Commonwealth Fund's Douglas McCarthy and David Radley highlighted Medicaid expansion as one way to bridge the North-South healthcare divide. ""If all states participate in Medicaid expansions, the geographic divide documented by the scorecard might narrow,” they wrote. “However, if many states do not, the divide could widen in the future.""

Doctors’ #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia - The Atlantic,3646,"In spite of all of our teachers' and bosses' warnings that it's not a trustworthy source of information, we all rely on Wikipedia. Not only when we can’t remember the name of that guy from that movie, which is a fairly low-risk use, but also when we find a weird rash or are just feeling a little off and we’re not sure why. One in three Americans have tried to diagnose a medical condition with the help of the Internet, and a new report says doctors are just as drawn to Wikipedia’s flickering flame. According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics’ “Engaging patients through social media” report, Wikipedia is the top source of healthcare information for both doctors and patients. Fifty percent of physicians use Wikipedia for information, especially for specific conditions. Generally, more people turn to Wikipedia for rare diseases than common conditions. The top five conditions looked up on the site over the past year were: tuberculosis, Crohn’s disease, pneumonia, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Patients tend to use Wikipedia as a “starting point for their online self education,” the report says. It also found a “direct correlation between Wikipedia page visits and prescription volumes.” We already knew that more and more people were turning to the Internet in general and Wikipedia specifically for health information, and we could hardly stop them if we tried. “Wikipedia entries often appear highest in the results pages of various search engines and the public perception of Wikipedia being a legitimate source of information has increased dramatically in recent years,” the report reads. “For healthcare in particular, patients are concerned about the validity and neutrality of the information they seek out, and Wikipedia increasingly meets this need, providing supplemental information to that which they receive from clinicians.” Being crowd-sourced, the information may well be neutral, but is it accurate? Knowing that doctors, too, are using these resources raises old concerns about the quality of information that comes up when you type your condition into Google. But doctors are aware of this, and an effort called Wikiproject Medicine is dedicated to improving the quality of medical information on Wikipedia. The IMS report looked at changes to five articles—diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer and prostate cancer—and found them to be in a state of constant flux. Those articles were changed, on average, between 16 and 46 times a month. But one of the major contributors to those articles was Dr. James Heilman, the founder of Wikiproject Medicine’s Medicine Translation task force. “This task force’s goal is getting 200 medical articles to a good or featured status (only 0.1 percent of articles on Wikipedia have this status), simplifying the English and then translating this content to as many languages as possible,” the report says. “The aim is to improve the quality of the most read medical articles on Wikipedia and ensure that this quality will reach non-English speakers.” A class offered at the University of California, San Francisco last fall also had medical students editing Wikipedia for class credit. I spoke with Dr. Amin Azzam, the professor teaching the course, in October, about the importance of getting doctors to put their medical knowledge online. “I do feel we have a moral obligation, as members of the profession to be reaching out to the people we intend to serve, where they are—and they are on the Internet,” he told me. And now it seems that not only doctors’ patients are finding medical information online—so are their colleagues.","MARCH 5, 2014"
The Quiet Health-Care Revolution - The Atlantic,22224,"Half an hour later, the phone rang. It was Sandra at the clinic. She too was concerned about Ellen’s weight, which had jumped three pounds since the previous day. Sandra knew this because Ellen’s scale had transmitted its reading to the clinic over a wireless connection. Given that Ellen had a history of congestive heart failure, a three-pound weight gain in 24 hours was a potentially dangerous development, a sign of possible fluid buildup in the lungs and increasing pressure on an already stressed heart. Sandra wanted her to come in for an immediate visit: the clinic would provide a car to pick her up and bring her back home. Ellen’s treatment began that very morning and continued for two weeks until she was out of danger. Had the warning signs not been noticed and addressed so quickly, she might easily have suffered a long, painful, and expensive hospitalization. Dan, a retired letter carrier, is a patient at a clinic in the same system. At 87, he is decidedly frail, his once-sturdy legs now weak and unsteady. He is a classic candidate for a fall of the kind that has injured many of his friends, in some cases leading to weeks in the hospital and months of rehab. The elderly are prone to falls for many obvious reasons, including weak limbs, impaired vision, and medication side effects. But Dan’s doctors knew that some less obvious causes included shag carpets and long, untrimmed toenails. Because of this, they’d sent someone from the clinic to visit Dan’s apartment and make sure that his daughter replaced the 1980s-vintage carpets with low-pile rugs. Dan also visits the clinic regularly for light muscle-training sessions and periodic toenail clipping. Due to these preventive measures, Dan and his fellow clinic patients are one-fifth as likely as comparable patients elsewhere to suffer falls. Joe, a 79-year-old diabetic, cut his foot when he banged it against a door. When it didn’t heal after a couple of days, he limped into the office of his family physician. After glancing at the cut, his doctor immediately sent Joe to a clinic in the same system as those that treated Ellen and Dan. For diabetics, even small cuts can be a serious matter: untended, they can become infected and contribute to an alarmingly high rate of amputation. At the clinic, a nurse practitioner cleaned and dressed the wound, and told Joe she wanted to see him there in two days so she could inspect and treat it again—and two days after that, and two days after that, until it was fully healed. The clinic would arrange for transportation if needed. Thanks to the steady, regular care, Joe’s foot healed without any infection or threat of amputation. Ellen, Dan, and Joe are all real people, though their names have been changed. The clinics that serve them are all affiliated with CareMore, a company based in Cerritos, California, that operates 26 care centers across the Southwest, serving more than 50,000 Medicare Advantage patients. Those numbers are likely to grow, perhaps dramatically, in the next few years: in August, CareMore was acquired by the insurer and health-services provider WellPoint, which serves 70 million people nationwide directly or through subsidiaries, and has plans to expand the CareMore model. CareMore, through its unique approach to caring for the elderly, is routinely achieving patient outcomes that other providers can only dream about: a hospitalization rate 24 percent below average; hospital stays 38 percent shorter; an amputation rate among diabetics 60 percent lower than average. Perhaps most remarkable of all, these improved outcomes have come without increased total cost. Though they may seem expensive, CareMore’s “upstream” interventions—the wireless scales, the free rides to medical appointments, etc.—save money in the long run by preventing vastly more costly “downstream” outcomes such as hospitalizations and surgeries. As a result, CareMore’s overall member costs are actually 18 percent below the industry average. In addition to policies designed to extend health-care benefits to more than 30 million previously uninsured Americans, the Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law in 2010, contains a host of provisions aimed at lowering overall health-care costs and improving quality of care at the same time. These provisions include the adoption of electronic medical records, programs to increase at-home care and preventive care, the development of evidence-based protocols to improve quality, disincentives for unnecessary rehospitalizations, and other measures, many of them focused on Medicare, which is a primary driver of increasing costs. The central idea that quality can be improved while costs are being reduced has been met with varying degrees of hope and skepticism. Yet many of the provisions called for have been standard operating practice at CareMore for years. And the company’s success to date suggests that such efforts to “bend the curve,” achieving better outcomes at a lower cost, may be more plausible than they sound. The implications for the future of Medicare—and the nation’s fiscal health—may be substantial. Zinberg was alarmed. Back in the 1960s, he’d founded a large internal-medicine practice that had grown to include some 20 physicians in a range of specialties, from cardiology and oncology to rheumatology and nephrology. But by the late 1980s, with a small number of HMOs growing more dominant, referrals were dwindling and restrictions on services were multiplying. Zinberg and his colleagues were forced to spend ever more time on the phone with “benefits coordinators,” whose main job seemed to be finding reasons to deny coverage. Already in his late 50s, Zinberg could have simply retired and walked away from the problem, as many of his colleagues were doing. Instead, he made a different decision. Zinberg had long been mulling the elements of a coordinated-care system that would be centered on reducing hassles and improving outcomes for patients rather than simply cutting costs. He began to envision a health-care organization in which teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, trainers, and other professionals worked together, continually sharing information and insights about their mutual clients and providing whatever services were needed to keep those clients in the best possible physical and mental health. Zinberg spent almost two years struggling to recruit physicians to launch his program. “During 1991 and ’92 my wife barely saw me,” he recalls. “I was having dinner four nights a week with groups of doctors, explaining my concept. I was begging them, literally begging them, to help me create a new health-care-delivery system.” Fortunately, a few of the doctors Zinberg approached were moved to join by their personal connections with him or by the depth and sincerity of his commitment to the cause. By 1993, physicians and teams of physicians operating 28 separate medical offices had agreed to become affiliates of Zinberg’s new system, CareMore Medical Group. Zinberg had always seen his vision of coordinated care as especially well suited to the needs of the elderly. As a gastroenterologist, he naturally saw a high percentage of older patients in his practice, and as he himself grew older, his interest in the physiology of aging deepened. (His ideas on the subjects of exercise, nutrition, genetics, and memory retention would lead to his 2003 book, Win in the Second Half.) And Zinberg recognized that elderly patients covered by Medicare—the people normally regarded as the greatest drain on the health-care system—could benefit the most from special attention. Because the existing system failed to connect the dots, they experienced a variety of unnecessary complications: avoidable hospitalizations, duplication of treatment, misdiagnoses, needless suffering, and sheer neglect. At first, CareMore accepted patients of all ages, but in 1997 Zinberg and his team restructured the company around his original concept, focusing on the elderly and eventually accepting payment exclusively from the Medicare Advantage program. Rather than paying for services rendered (the traditional fee-for-service model), Medicare Advantage pays CareMore an annual per-patient fee, adjusted according to each client’s risk profile. This system, by replacing the distorted incentives of the fee-for-service economic model, allows CareMore to be rewarded for innovative, results-oriented care. In particular, it enables the company to build specialized programs for its highest-risk patients, who generally suffer more—and run up astronomical costs—under traditional fee-for-service plans. One of CareMore’s critical insights was the application of an old systems-management principle first developed at Bell Labs in the 1930s and refined by the management guru W. Edwards Deming in the 1950s: you can fix a problem at step one for $1, or fix it at step 10 for $30. The American health-care system is repair-centric, not prevention-centric. We wait for train wrecks and then clean up the damage. What would happen if we prevented the train wrecks in the first place? The doctors at CareMore decided to find out. An early discovery was that CareMore’s elderly patients failed to show up for as many as one-third of their doctor appointments. As Charles Holzner, one of Zinberg’s initial partners at CareMore and now a senior physician with the company, explains, “About one in three of the elderly people we were taking care of were home by themselves. They’d outlived their family resources, they couldn’t drive, and their kids lived out of town. So when they got sick, they ended up calling 911. And when it came to routine doctor visits, they sometimes just couldn’t make it at all.” CareMore’s unconventional solution to the problem was to provide transportation, at no charge, to get patients to their medical appointments. Local car-service companies were happy to have the business, and while the transportation cost money, it ultimately saved a lot more. Increased regularity and consistency of medical care meant that many simple problems were recognized and treated in their early stages: complications were avoided, and rates of hospitalization and nursing-home admittance began to fall. The problem of “noncompliance” isn’t limited to missed appointments, either. Patients, especially elderly ones, also leave prescriptions unfilled, medicines untaken, exercise-and-diet regimens unfollowed, and symptoms unnoticed and unreported. Health-care professionals often grumble about noncompliance, but given the myriad demands on their time, they generally can do very little about it. At CareMore, by contrast, Zinberg decided, “noncompliance is our problem, not the patient’s.” So the company began adding more nonmedical services to its routine care in order to improve compliance rates—for example, sending health-care professionals to its patients’ homes to make sure they had scales to keep tabs on their weight, to look for loose throw rugs that might cause falls, and to provide “talking pill boxes” that remind patients to take their medicine with preset alarms. Each of these innovations led to a small improvement in patient wellness and a corresponding improvement in the economics of providing care. Next, CareMore began experimenting with an aggressive treatment of diabetes, one of the most widespread and debilitating illnesses suffered by elderly patients. The primary treatment for diabetes, insulin injection, had long been considered inappropriate for the elderly—too intrusive, too difficult, and too costly for patients whose life expectancy was already short. But CareMore doctors made insulin-injection treatment available to their patients. They also set about investigating exactly how the worst complications associated with diabetes occurred. Take amputations, for example. The typical chain of events begins with a small cut on the foot suffered by a diabetic patient and self-treated using an ordinary home remedy such as a Band-Aid. If the cut resists healing for a week or more, the patient visits her primary-care physician. The doctor cleans the wound, changes the dressing, and advises the patient on further care, but with no way of knowing whether the advice will be followed. A week later, with the wound getting worse, the patient visits her doctor again and is referred to a surgeon. After the typical two-week wait for an appointment, the patient learns from the surgeon that gangrene is now beginning to develop, and she is referred to a specialized vascular surgeon. After yet another two-week delay, the vascular surgeon sees a wound so serious that a hospital stay and amputation are now inevitable—at a cost of many thousands of dollars and an untold degree of suffering. All beginning with a single, scarcely noticeable cut. CareMore responded by creating a wound clinic, staffed by nurses whose primary job was to care for diabetic patients with small cuts. The wound-clinic nurses would change the dressing every other day and spend a few minutes talking with the patient, making sure the wound was healing on schedule. Over time, amputation rates for CareMore’s diabetic patients fell to 60 percent below the Medicare average. Another recent CareMore innovation is wireless monitoring for patients with congestive heart failure or hypertension: the former, such as Ellen, receive wireless scales on which to weigh themselves every day; the latter, wireless blood-pressure cuffs. After six months of using the wireless-scale system, CareMore found that hospital readmissions for congestive heart failure had fallen by 56 percent. Now the company is testing similar systems for diabetes monitoring, as well as the use of camera phones for daily conversations with a nurse practitioner. Not all of these innovations are unique to CareMore—wound clinics for diabetics, for example, are becoming more common. But the company’s focus on integrated care is exceptional, and at the center of it all is a care manager called an “extensivist.” The term originated to describe a physician who served as a bridge, or “extension,” connecting hospital care with outpatient follow-up treatments. At CareMore, it refers to a doctor who coordinates multiple kinds of care for an individual patient. The underlying philosophy is simple: a patient is one unified human being, not a collection of disconnected symptoms. One New England Journal of Medicine study looking at the care received by Medicare beneficiaries found that those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and lung cancer were typically visiting several different primary-care doctors and specialists. These doctors only rarely speak to one another, coordinate their plans, or consult on the possible interactions among their treatments. In such cases, it generally falls to the patients to keep track of their various treatments—a role that very few laypeople have the time, energy, and expertise to play effectively. “When we started CareMore, we found … a sizable fraction of our patients would inevitably get readmitted over and over again, if you treated them like routine patients,” explains Charles Holzner. “So to keep our patients out of the hospital, I began seeing them myself every week or two. I basically became their personal doctor, making sure they understood their postoperative regimen and were following it correctly. But very rapidly, I became overloaded. So I told Dr. Zinberg, ‘We need more people like me.’” An extensivist must be a knowledgeable physician, of course, and must have the proper tools available. (One such tool is QuickView, a system of unified electronic health-care records of the kind that the Affordable Care Act aims to promote on an experimental basis around the country, but which is already up and running at CareMore.) But people skills and a talent for clear, effective communication are even more important. “I saw that when I got involved in a patient’s care, if I gained his trust, he would do anything I told him to do,” Holzner emphasizes. “So showing patients that we have their best interests at heart—unlike some of the HMOs and other providers out there—is key to a strong and healthy relationship.” In the long run, though, the company’s impact on the economics of health care may be more important still. When he launched CareMore in 1993, Sheldon Zinberg told his partners, “If you put people before profit, everyone profits.” During its first four years, operating as a more-or-less conventional health-care provider, CareMore accumulated losses of about $11 million. But as the system of Medicare-financed, coordinated care Zinberg had initially envisioned came into being, the company turned the corner, showing a $24 million profit in 2000. It has remained solidly in the black ever since. The economic logic behind CareMore is unusual. Every additional service it provides costs money, and the professionals at CareMore have to take on tasks and responsibilities that physicians don’t traditionally assume. CareMore employs more staffers per patient than other companies, and they spend more time with patients and their families than is typical. But every dollar CareMore spends saves multiple dollars down the line, resulting in those member costs that are 18 percent below the industry average. The crucial question is whether the CareMore model—or models like it—can work on a much larger scale. The American health-care marketplace, after all, has had many one-off success stories that have defied replication. The few examples of successful expansion—Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic, for instance—tend to highlight just how slow and difficult the process can be. And many medical groups have found to their dismay that something peculiar to their culture or leadership does not translate to new clinics or markets. It was with this challenge in mind that a group of private-equity investors purchased CareMore from Zinberg and his partners in 2006 and made Alan Hoops the CEO. Hoops’s experience and mind-set were well suited to the task of expanding and replicating the CareMore model for new regions and patients. As the chairman and CEO of PacifiCare in the 1990s, he’d led the health-care company to achieve exceptional growth, with revenues increasing from $2 billion in 1993 to $11 billion in 2000. Hoops also started PacifiCare’s Secure Horizons program, which under his leadership became the country’s largest Medicare HMO, serving more than 1 million beneficiaries. Hoops knew from the beginning that CareMore’s operational and clinical processes could be documented, systematized, streamlined, and replicated. But he also knew that the real magic of the company was in the physician-led culture and the top-to-bottom commitment to patients. The growth challenge, as he saw it, involved replicating the model in local communities, not building “scale” in a single location. “Scale implies we need huge numbers of patients to make our system work,” Hoops explains. “That’s not so. We can set up shop in a community, attract 3,000 to 5,000 patients, and begin having an impact in terms of reduced costs and improved patient outcomes right away.” Hoops’s focus has been on making this replication strategy work—and so far he appears to have been successful. From 2005 to 2010, CareMore managed to grow its membership by 15 percent each year. And despite differences in population demographics and community environments, CareMore has branched out into Arizona and Nevada, while expanding in its native California. The company hires a leadership team for a new market almost a year in advance and has them work in an existing clinic to learn the specific CareMore patient-care model. When the new center opens, an experienced leadership team works side by side with the new team for the first six months of operation. New employees are integrated into the company culture and encouraged to become active members of the continuous-learning and -improvement environment. Hoops’s efforts to replicate the CareMore model should gain new momentum following the company’s August acquisition by WellPoint, which operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country. WellPoint serves 34 million members in its affiliated health plans and another 35 million through subsidiaries. “CareMore was a perfect strategic fit with the direction in which we’re moving our company,” said Angela Braly, the CEO of WellPoint. “We have been focused on delivering greater health-care value, and finding ways to put the patient in the center of the system … That’s the entire focus of the CareMore model.” WellPoint’s extensive infrastructure, access to capital, national Health Information Technology capabilities, and existing relationships with patients and physicians could all accelerate the process of replicating the CareMore model. “In our service areas, 1 million Baby Boomers will be joining Medicare from now until 2030,” Braly said. “That’s an extraordinary level of potential demand.” Moreover, the population that CareMore serves—the elderly, and in particular the frail, high-risk elderly—is crucial when it comes to controlling overall health-care costs. “We talk as if we need to overhaul the entire health-care system,” Hoops says. “But that’s not quite correct. The biggest problem—and opportunity—lies with the part of the system that serves our high-risk populations. That’s the part of the system that’s unsustainable.” Braly believes that as CareMore continues to expand, it will help redirect the health-care conversation in Washington. “Many people are skeptical that it is possible to significantly improve quality and reduce costs at the same time,” she says. “The CareMore experience shows that if you change the underlying process, you can, in fact, achieve both objectives, and you can do so consistently.” It remains to be seen whether the WellPoint-CareMore partnership will work as planned and replicate CareMore’s experience on a mass scale. But whether this endeavor succeeds or not, the integrated, early-intervention model pioneered by Sheldon Zinberg in the mid-1990s is likely to offer lessons for American health-care reform, now and in the future.",NOVEMBER 2011 ISSUE
Universal Rural Health Care in China? Not So Fast - The Atlantic,5575,"China’s top health authority announced Friday that 99 percent of rural Chinese, or 800 million individuals, are now covered by the country’s New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Ten years ago, in 2003, just 8 million rural Chinese had health insurance. By 2005 that number had jumped to 179 million, and in less than ten years, according to official statistics, China has attained near universal coverage in rural areas. Dr. Qiulin Chen, Assistant Professor of Population and Labor Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, is skeptical of these numbers. He explained that the rural population as a whole may be underestimated, leaving out unregistered people ineligible for the NCMS. These individuals remain uninsured. “Some rural people work in the city and are not covered [under the rural health insurance program] or any urban health insurance program,” Chen said. “Only those with official citizenship are [included].” By 2010, 93 percent of the population was covered by some form of health insurance. The lower number of urban residents covered (65 percent) reflects some of the difficulties in tracking rural-to-urban migrants. From 1950 to the early 1980s, China’s rural health scheme depended mainly on Mao Zedong’s “barefoot doctors” and a remarkable public health network that was almost exclusively government funded and run. Rural health care coverage reached almost 90 percent during this time. This was brought to a halt after the economic reforms of the late 1970s, when healthcare as a state-owned enterprise was transformed and privatized. Rural health insurance programs ceased operating, and urban schemes floundered under the crippling cost of health care and the inefficiency of state-run hospitals. As the number of healthcare workers in the countryside plummeted in the wake of the reforms, the cost of medicine soared. Soon, pharmacies were closing, and by the late 1980s the rural healthcare system had all but collapsed, draining the countryside of quality healthcare workers. Public dissatisfaction grew as health care costs continued to rise sharply and quality service became increasingly unaffordable. This scrutiny came to a head during the SARS outbreak in 2003, during which the public decried a system that provided little preventative and emergency care. Over the course of the next decade, the government rolled out one of the most extensive health care coverage systems in history. In 2009 China unveiled its blueprint for health reform, guaranteeing that in three years its goal of universal coverage would be met. Authorities committed 850 billion RMB (about US $126 billion) to the “four beams” of reform: public health care, medical care, essential drugs and health insurance (including the Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, the Urban Employee-based Basic Medical Insurance Scheme and the Urban Resident-Based Basic Medical Insurance Scheme). While there has been undeniable progress, some groups still lack coverage. This is particularly true for disabled and vulnerable people in China’s countryside. Dr. Gry Sagli of the Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, who researches poverty and disability in China, explained that “high out-of-pocket expenses remain a major problem, the rates for reimbursement are far too low and the insurance covers only a narrow range of conditions.” Care for individuals with disabilities remains problematic. Citing 2009 data from the China Disabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF), Dr. Sagli stated that “less than 10 percent of the people with disabilities in rural areas receive treatment and rehabilitation training. This did not change much in the period from 2007-2009 (8.4 percent in 2007, 9.0 percent in 2008 and 9.5 percent in 2009—the period of the new insurance). That is a positive, but small change.” Because the rural health insurance program runs primarily on public funds, it is not able to provide generous drug reimbursement. Co-payments are still high and financial risk protection is limited, although there is a medical financial assistance program that targets people living below the poverty line. In an email, Dr. Chen outlined a few policies that he said could improve rural healthcare: China is a huge country with very different levels of economic and social development, and determinants of health often lie outside the health sector. Local governments are the ones primarily responsible for health reform, which becomes problematic as they are often more focused on building economic infrastructure. In these cases, healthcare may not be a priority, although Dr. Chen is optimistic for change as the “health performance” indicator of local officials is often evaluated by the local NCMS participation rate. The announcement of increased health care coverage in China is good news, but attention must be paid to what can still be improved. “It is, of course, a great success of the Chinese authorities that the new forms of health insurances have achieved such a high percentage of availability and coverage within a short period of time,” said Dr Sagli. “Data from China Disabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF) indicates that to a large extent households with disabled members participate in the new health insurance scheme, which is good; but although the impact of the insurance has been positive, the insurance (as it was implemented in 2010) was inadequate in helping to improve their life situation and break the vicious circle of disability and poverty.” This post first appeared at Tea Leaf Nation, an Atlantic partner site.","SEPTEMBER 6, 2013"
Liberals Are Wrong: Free Market Health Care Is Possible  - The Atlantic,8589,"Avik S. A. Roy - Avik Roy is a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and author of The Apothecary, a Forbes blog on health-care and entitlement reform. One of the big divides between liberals and conservatives, of course, is on the value and utility of the free market. Most Americans appreciate that market-based economies, broadly speaking, outperform state-based ones. But most, if not all, progressives make the argument that health care is different: that markets may work for computers and soda pop, but they don't work in health care. The most famous exponent of the theory that markets can't work in health care comes from Stanford economist Ken Arrow. In 1963, the Ford Foundation approached Arrow--an up-and-coming economist, albeit one without prior health care experience--about applying his theories to the practical problems of health, education, and welfare. With Ford's support, in December of that year, Arrow published a paper in the American Economic Review entitled ""Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care."" In it, Arrow endorsed the view that ""the laissez-faire solution for medicine is intolerable,"" that the delivery of health care deviates in fundamental ways from a classical free market, and therefore, that government must intervene to correct these deviations. Arrow's paper energized those who were already predisposed to skepticism about free markets. Indeed, many people credit Arrow with inventing the field of health economics. Arrow went on to share the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1972, becoming the youngest person to ever garner that honor, albeit for his work outside of health care. With characteristic understatement, Paul Krugman wrote in 2009, ""Economists have known for 45 years -- ever since Kenneth Arrow's seminal paper -- that the standard competitive market model just doesn't work for health care...To act all wide-eyed and innocent about these problems at this late date is either remarkably ignorant or simply disingenuous."" Ken Arrow's critique of health care markets Arrow identified five principal distortions in the market for health care services and products:
 Arrow wasn't wrong to point out these distortions. Where Arrow goes wrong is in contending that these distortions are unusual, or unique to health care. Indeed, Arrow's prescriptions for addressing health care's distorted market involve...further distortion. Arrow's antique critique From today's perspective, Arrow's commentary comes across as a bit antique. Let's go through his objections. Unpredictability is hardly unique to health care. Indeed, in the five decades since 1963, an entire industry has emerged to address the problem of unpredictability. Think of the extended warranties you're offered when you buy a new television, in case the product stops working. If you worry about being suddenly short of money, or accidentally making a mistake with your checking account, you can buy overdraft protection. If you're afraid of flying, you can buy traveler's insurance. And I haven't even brought up the classical forms of insurance, such as homeowner's insurance, auto insurance, and life insurance. It's true that we have instituted barriers to entry in the delivery of medical care. It's a problem that Paul Starr documents well in his definitive history of the subject, The Social Transformation of American Medicine. But again, this is hardly a problem that is unique to health care. It's a lot easier to get a medical degree than it is to start an airline or a bank from scratch. We require licensure of lawyers, but Ken Arrow never managed to write a paper advocating for the nationalization of the legal industry. And it's not just doctors and lawyers: in many parts of America, you need a license to become a cat groomer, tattoo artist, or a tree trimmer. Trust is certainly important in medicine. But trust is also important in many, if not most, commercial transactions. We trust that the manufacturers of car brakes have thoroughly vetted their products. We trust that cruise ship captains are sober when they're on duty. And if we feel our trust has been violated, we trust properly licensed lawyers to sue on our behalf. As any Megan McArdle fan knows, asymmetries of information are everywhere. The ancient Latin aphorism caveat emptor (""let the buyer beware"") has been enshrined in property law for centuries. The idea is that sellers know more about the defects of what they are selling than do buyers. Hence, traditionally, we hold buyers responsible for understanding what they are buying, so long as the sellers haven't engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation. We accept that auto mechanics know more about our car's problems than we do, and we take our business elsewhere if we feel like they've been ripping us off. When it comes to medicine, the internet has made great strides in reducing asymmetries of information. A parent of a child with a genetic disorder, or Lyme disease, is likely to know as much, if not more, about available treatments than will your garden-variety family practitioner. Patient forums and websites like WebMD give people access to medical knowledge in a way that they didn't have it before. The last of Arrow's concerns is the most important: that we pay for medical services in a non-standard way, especially through third parties. Free-marketeers have long sought to remedy this problem. On the other hand, Arrow's proposed solution to third-party payment--government-sponsored insurance--makes the problem worse, by further removing patients from the price and value of the care they receive. Can we shop for health care? Today's progressives add a few more bullet points to Arrow's critique. Some say that health care is a uniquely emotional decision. I might shop for a laptop based on the speed of its microprocessor and the resolution of its screen, but if I get cancer, I'm going to want the best possible care, with price as no object. But we make many purchases on an emotional basis. I occasionally take a date out to a nice restaurant, instead of buying her a sandwich at the grocery store, and not because the restaurant's food has superior nutritional content. Entire industries--jewelry, say, or Hollywood--exist for no other reason than to satisfy our emotional interests. My point here is not to say that health care is the same thing as jewelry: but rather that health care's emotional component is not economically unique. Others point out that you can't always shop for health care. If you have a heart attack and become unconscious, you aren't capable of deciding where to get treated. This is probably one of the most important ways in which health care can differ from other economies. So let's stipulate that this is true. No, you can't shop for health care when you're unconscious, or when you're in acute or emergent situations. Does this justify nationalizing the health care system? No. At most, it justifies nationalizing a subset of health-care decisions that take place in acute settings. For example: I am certainly capable of shopping around to find a reputable doctor that will offer me a routine prostate exam at a reasonable price. I'm even capable of shopping around for care for chronic conditions, like diabetes or end-stage kidney disease. I'm less capable of shopping around if I have a stroke (though I am capable of shopping for an insurance plan that will try to help me get cost-effective treatment). Of the $2.6 trillion Americans spent on health care in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, $814 billion--31 percent--was for hospital care. And not all hospital care is acute. So, the inability to shop for care applies to less than three-tenths of all health spending. So, it seems to me, those who strongly believe in the shopping argument for socialized medicine should adopt a hybrid approach. Let's have a free market for the 70-plus percent of health care where market forces can most directly apply, and let's have universal catastrophic insurance for those situations where market forces work less well. This way, we might get the best of both worlds: an efficient, affordable, high-quality market for chronic and routine health care, and a universal system for those who get hit by a bus, or have a stroke, or get cancer. Such a system would leave no one behind. But it would also allow our health-care system to benefit, as much as possible, from the forces of choice, competition, and innovation.

"Healthcare.gov: Code Developed by the People and for the People, Released Back to the People - The Atlantic",25941,"As the first website to be demonstrated by a sitting President of the United States, Healthcare.gov already occupies an unusual place in history. In October, it will take on an even more important historic role, guiding millions of Americans through the process of choosing health insurance. How a website is built or designed may seem mundane to many people, but when the site in question is focused upon such an important function, what it looks like and how it works matter. Last week, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) relaunched Healthcare.gov with a new appearance and modern technology that is unusual in federal-government websites. ""It's fast, built in static HTML, completely scalable and secure,"" said Bryan Sivak, chief technology officer of HHS, in an interview. ""It's basically setting up a web server. That's the beauty of it."" What makes such an ambitious experiment in social coding more unusual is that the larger political and health-care policy context that it's being been built within is more fraught with tension and scrutiny than any other arena in the federal government. The implementation and outcomes of the Affordable Care Act -- AKA ""Obamacare"" -- will affect millions of people, from the premiums they pay to the incentives for the health care they receive. ""The goal is get people enrolled,"" said Sivak. ""A step to that goal is to build a health insurance marketplace. It is so much better to build it in a way that's open, transparent and enables updates. This is better than a big block of proprietary code locked up in a CMS [content management system]."" Thinking differently about a .gov
The new site has been built in public for months, iteratively created on Github using cutting edge open-source technologies. Healthcare.gov is the rarest of birds: a next-generation website that also happens to be a .gov. ""We needed to evolve from the previous site but didn't want a total departure,"" said Ed Mullen, a user experience designer who has worked on Healthcare.gov since it was first launched, in an interview. ""The web has changed dramatically in that time. Part of adapting to that [change] has been creating a site that really understands consumers. Today, consumers are doing all kinds of things across the web. We're comparing ourselves to Rdio and similar services. We want to be aligned with the current thinking of the Web."" The people that helped to build the new Healthcare.gov are unusual: Instead of some obscure sub-contractor in a nameless office park in northern Virginia, the site was iteratively created by a cross-disciplinary team of developers and editors at HHS, and contractors at Teal Design, Edward Mullen Studio, and Development Seed, a scrappy startup in a garage in the District of Columbia. ""This is such a lean site,"" said Jon Booth, head of the web and new media group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in an interview. ""HHS had a blanket contract when we when awarded this. Aquilent got creative and brought people on with powerful skills, like Ed and Jessica, a designer at Teal Media, and Development Seed. Most of my team is working on this site; we have internal UX, information architects, designers, developers, and infrastructure people that stood up the cloud environment. Their collaboration is one of the high points of this process."" The involvement of Development Seed drove specific technology choices that led to substantial improvements in design and function. The startup first made its mark in the DC tech scene consulting on Drupal, an open source content management system that has become popular in the federal government over the past several years. Recently, Development Seed has been pushing the limits of lightweight Web design, open data-driven maps and open-source code. ""This is our ultimate dogfooding experience,"" said Eric Gundersen, the co-founder of Development Seed, in an interview. ""We're going to build it and then buy insurance through it."" ""The work that they're doing is amazing,"" said Sivak, ""like how they organize their sprints and code. It's incredible what can happen when you give a team of talented developers and managers and let them go."" The new Healthcare.gov will fill a yawning gap in the technology infrastructure deployed to support the mammoth law, providing a federal choice engine for the more than 30 different states that did not develop their own health-insurance exchanges, but the site is just one component of the insurance exchanges. Others may not be ready by the October deadline. According to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is behind in implementing key aspects of the law, such as training the workers who will help people navigate the process, certifying the plans that will be sold on the exchanges, and determining the eligibility of consumers for federal subsidies. Despite all this, HHS expressed confidence to the GAO that exchanges will be open and functioning in every state on October 1. On that day, Healthcare.gov will be the primary interface for Americans to learn about and shop for health insurance, as Dave Cole, a lead developer at Development Seed, wrote in a blog post this March. Cole, who served as a senior advisor to the United States chief information officer and deputy director of new media at the White House, was a key part of the team that moved WhiteHouse.gov to Drupal. As he explained, the code will be open in two important ways: Putting open source to work
According to Sivak, his team didn't get directly involved in the new Healthcare.gov until November 2012. After that, ""we facilitated the right conversations around what to build and how to build it, emphasizing the consumer-facing aspects of it,"" he said. ""The other part was to figure what the right infrastructure was going to be to build this thing."" That decision is where this story gets especially interesting, if you're interested in how government uses technology to deliver information to the people it serves. Government websites have not, historically, been sterling examples of design or usability. Unfortunately, in many cases, they're also built at great expense, given the dependence of government agencies on contractors and systems integrators, and use technologies that are years behind the rest of the web. Healthcare.gov could have gone in the same direction, but for the influence of its young chief technology officer, an ""entrepreneur-in-residence"" who had successfully navigated the bureaucracies of the District of Columbia and state of Maryland. ""Our first plan was to leverage Percussion, a commercial CMS that we'd been using for a long time,"" said Sivak. ""The problem I had with that plan was that it wasn't going to be easy to update the code. The process was complicated. Simple changes to navigation were going to take a month."" At that point, Sivak did what most people do in this new millennium when making a technology choice: He reached out to his social networks and went online. ""We started talking to people about a better way, including people who had just come off the Obama campaign,"" he said. ""I learned about the ground they had broken for the political space, from A/B testing to lightweight infrastructure, and started reading about where all that came from. We started thinking about Jekyll as a platform and using Prose.io."" After Sivak and his team read about Development Seed's work with Jekyll, they contacted the startup directly. After a little convincing, Development Seed agreed to consult on one more .gov project. ""A Presidential Innovation Fellow used same tech we're using for several of their projects,"" said Cole. ""Bryan [Sivak] heard about it and talked to us. He asked where we would go. We wanted to be on Github. We knew there were performance and reliability benefits from building the stack on HTML."" Jekyll, for those who are unfamiliar with web-development trends, is a way for developers to build a static website from dynamic components. Instead of running a traditional website with a relational database and server-side code, using Jekyll enables programmers to create content like they create code. The end result of this approach is a site that loads faster for users, a crucial performance issue, particularly on mobile devices. ""Instead of [running] farms of application servers to handle massive load, you're basically slimming down to two,"" said Sivak. ""You're just using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, all being done in responsive design. The way it's being built matters. You could in theory do the same with application servers and a CMS, but it would be much more complex. What we're doing here is giving anyone with basic skills to basic changes on the fly. You don't need expensive consultants."" That adds up to cost savings. Sites that are heavily trafficked -- as Healthcare.gov can reasonably expected to be - normally have to use a caching layer to serve static content and add more server capacity as demand increases. ""When we worked with the World Bank, they chose a plan from Rackspace for 16 servers,"" said Gundersen. ""That added tens of thousands of dollars, with a huge hosting bill every month."" HHS had similar strategic plans for the new site, at least at first. ""They were planning 32 servers, between staging, production and disaster recovery, with application servers for different environments,"" said Cole. ""You're just talking about content. There just needs to be one server. We're going to have two, with one for backup. That's a deduction of 30 servers."" Why was Development Seed able to succeed in selling this approach to coding and collaboration with a federal agency and other contractors, in contrast to traditional systems integrators? Or to put it another way, what could a mapping startup teach the world about making government work better? Quite a lot, as it turns out. ""It helps that we're running a cloud SaaS business,"" said Cole, referring to MapBox. ""If you're not doing your own products and using your own products, you're not going to have a sense of what the future is. You can put Wordpress into Amazon but then you'll have problems; it wasn't designed to be a cloud application. In this case, the code is completely cloud-ready and able to be scaled through a CDN [content delivery network], through Akamai. Understanding that comes from running a cloud company."" While Jekyll eliminates the need for a full-blown content management system for Healthcare.gov (and with it, related costs) people managing the site still need to be able to update it. That's where Prose.io comes in. Prose.io is an open-source content editor developed by Development Seed that gives non-programmers a clean user interface to update pages. ""If you create content and run Jekyll, it requires content editors to know code,"" said Cole. ""Prose is the next piece. You can run it on your on own servers or use a hosted version. It gives access to content in a CMS-like interface, basically adding a WYSIWYG [What You See Is What You Get] skin, giving you a text editor in the browser."" To non-technical users, Prose.io looks much like the standard ""What you see is what you get"" interface, familiar from Wordpress or Microsoft Word, with a couple bells and whistles, such as mobile editing. ""You can basically preview in live,"" said Cole. ""You usually don't get a full in-browser preview. The difference is you have this with no backend CMS. It's just a directory and text files, with a web interface that exposes it. There are no servers, no infrastructure, and no monthly costs. All you need is a need free web app and Github. If you don't want to use that, use Git and Github Enterprise."" Prose was built by Development Seed to enable them to pass management of code off to the owners of websites. That's exactly how it's being used here. ""We were doing Jekyll sites and wanted to turn them over to clients who could then maintain them themselves,"" said Cole. ""It's just a wrapper around the workflow, with design aesthetic to make it clean and something in the backend that's technical."" The technology behind Healthcare.gov also delivered on a crucial feature: a version geared toward a growing Spanish-speaking population that is quite likely to access the site on a mobile device. ""When you look at providing a Spanish translation or a mobile site, it becomes really complicated trying to have a site render in different ways, in different configurations,"" said Cole. ""A CMS needs a different version for each one. That's not true here, with a responsive, easy-to-iterate upon design. A change is a quick process, not altering any application code."" The HHS tech team is now singing the praise of that choice. ""One of the strong attractions for working in Jekyll is that you can have multiple versions of everything,"" said Booth. ""We can provide the exact same experience and mobile capacity on the Spanish website as on the English version."" While the front end of Healthcare.gov is distributed over Akamai, the back end of the site will be be hosted in a secure cloud. ""The servers are hosted in Terramark, a cloud computing firm that's a subsidiary of Verizon,"" said Booth. ""When we got involved, Terramark had already been selected as the vendor. We inherited that; it was our first major cloud deployment. It's wonderful, compared to the traditional 'buy a lot of boxes and get the servers set up.' Percussion was fine as a CMS but the scalability issue was huge for us, really overarching."" Combining these two approaches finally realized some of the more aspirational rhetoric about the potential of ""cloud computing"" to deliver better savings and services that has bounced around Washington over the past four years. ""For us, it's a combination of Terramark as data center and Akamai as content distribution network,"" said Cole. ""For the relaunch, no consumer traffic hits Terramark at all, with the exception of search queries. We have completely pushed the website out to Akamai, which gives us a lot of flexibility. This is by far the fastest site we've ever built. We wanted to make sure that this site is not adding any overhead, is as lightweight as it can be."" Embracing citizen-centric design
""Thinking differently"" about this site went beyond technical choices for architecture or how rules and regulations were instantiated in code. If you visit Healthcare.gov on a smartphone or tablet, you'll notice how quickly it loads, how clean the design is on mobile, and how the site renders to fit the size of your screen. That's no accident, as Mullen and Booth explained. ""Across the board, there was agreement that it needed to be all about the consumer,"" said Mullen. ""That was the mantra from the beginning. It comes down to understanding the audience, from thinking about the reading level of all content to writing clear, declarative sentences."" Focusing on the consumer -- or the citizen -- as the primary driver for design and technical decisions may sound like common sense but it's not a principle that appears to have animated the construction of many .gov websites over the past two decades. In recent years, however, design principles are redefining how online government is created and delivered, with notable results. ""We knew, building this marketplace from scratch, that we needed to have consistency,"" said Mullen. ""We had to make sure all efforts work together, from outreach, engagement, education, to enrollment. We knew there was an opportunity to make some changes and largely to simplify. The first time around, the site was a pretty big success. When it came time to reassess, what was the core mission? It boiled down to being a strictly consumer site."" ""Before we made any decisions on what the site was going to be, we did a lot of research into the population we were going to try to reach,"" explained Booth. ""One of our goals was to reach a much younger demographic,"" said Booth. ""That pointed us to doing mobile. Mobile is growing, representing about 10 percent of the traffic to medicare.gov now."" The goal of speaking clearly to the people that HHS is trying to reach drove a series of choices for design and content. ""One of the things we saw was the need to explain the project really clearly to people, not to introduce other topics that might be confusing,"" said Booth. ""The marketplace program was separate. We've moved away other parts, like the text of the law or implementation timeline. It's important to keep those materials online but on other properties. Policy guidelines also were moved over to other websites. We needed something that could speak clearly to the people we're trying to reach."" In design, choosing what not to include is as important as what elements do appear. The involvement of Teal Design early on and Edward Mullen throughout, focusing on user experience, made a difference in how Healthcare.gov looks and works on a mobile device today. Code for the people, with the people
Performance, citzen-centric design, and management aside, there's a deeper importance to how Healthcare.gov is being built that will remain relevant for years to come, perhaps even setting a new standard for federal government as a whole: updates to the code repository on Github can be adopted by every health insurance exchange using this code. (The only difference between different state sites is a skin with the state logo.) ""We have been working in the .gov space for a while,"" said Gundersen. ""Government people want to make the right decisions. What's nice about what Bryan [Sivak] is doing is that he's trying to make sure that everyone can learn from what HHS is doing in real-time. From a process standpoint, what Bryan is doing is going to change how tech is built. FCC is watching the repository on Github. When agencies can collaborate around code, what will happen? The amount of money we have the opportunity to save agencies is huge. Think about servers alone."" The impact of this reduction in infrastructure on costs was a point he made repeatedly. ""You can't underestimate the cost of complexity,"" said Gundersen. ""If you think the servers are expensive, consider the team required to maintain them."" With Healthcare.gov, something quite important happened that could also be lost in the mix: Code developed for the people, by the people, was released back to the people. ""There's an important legal detail here,"" said Cole. ""Public domain doesn't apply to works for hire and it doesn't apply to code developed by a contractor. Healthcare.gov and other code was developed under BSD, the most permissive license possible."" While the website, funding from the federal government paid for the improvement of a series of open source software tools that it itself used. ""It's nice when government doesn't just take from open source but contributes code back to the community,"" said Gundersen. The choice that HHS made in working with Development Seed meant that upgraded code for that tool was released on Github for the use of the public, over the course of the project. ""All of those contributions were made in real-time on Github as they were developed,"" said Cole. ""The code now pulls in Google Analytics to analyze content for popularity."" ""We got 10,000 authenticated users through Github and more through repository,"" said Cole. ""Recently, we did a complete redesign, adding mobile and responsive development. HHS paid for that development. They also paid for enhancement of other open source tools that people are already using."" Collaboration and cascading updates aren't an extra, in this context: they're mission-critical. ""This was a really distributed team, with design done by another party,"" said Cole.""It started with a 'lock in' that laid out architecture and design, then tech followed. We wanted something really agile, to get it right first and keep iterating. After four months of development, we put together a site that's responsive and multilingual, and did so scalably."" Sivak said that he expects the new site to continue to be improved iteratively over time, in response to how people are actually using it. ""We're going to be collecting all kinds of data,"" said Sivak. ""We will be using tools like Optimizely to do A/B and multivariate testing, seeing what works on the fly and adapting from there. We're trying to treat this like a consumer website. The goal of this is to get people enrolled in health care coverage and get insurance. It's not simple. It's relatively complex process. We need to provide a lot of information to help people make decisions. The more this site can act in a consumer-friendly fashion, surfacing information, helping people in simple ways, tracking how people are using it and where they're getting stuck, the more we can improve."" Sivak is a fan of the agile development methodology that has become part of start-up development everywhere, including using analytics tools to track usage and design accordingly. Notably, the HHS team has been using feedback to drive design choices from the beginning, applying the ""lean startup"" model to development. ""We did rounds of usability testing, starting early on with a card sort for taxonomy,"" said Booth. ""We built out wireframes and did testing on look and feel. From my point of view, that was informed by a mix of designers, then getting user feedback."" This approach may be maturing in the private sector but still feels novel in some parts of government. ""One thing that has been nice that isn't always there on federal projects was a lot of support from leadership to look at user feedback, watch what users tell us and then go from that,"" he said. ""It's not about what someone's favorite color might be."" The work of the team at HHS earned some praise from their collaborators at Development Seed. ""It's not a case where they needed developers,"" said Cole. ""They just needed to adapt an agile workflow, have a good conversation and manage requirements dynamically, not create a huge spreadsheet of what they wanted and come back in two months. Open by default
Using Jekyll and Prose.io to build the new Healthcare.gov is the latest chapter in government IT's quiet open source evolution. Across the federal government, judicious adoption of open source is slowly but surely leading to leaner, more interoperable systems. An open, agile approach to development gave Sivak and his team transparency into the status of the project through issue trackers on Github. ""Put yourself in Bryan's perspective, with his ability to know what's going on,"" said Gundersen. ""He could just open up an issue tracker and look at what's been done, not wait for a briefing."" Talking at length with HHS' CTO, it's clear that he's happy with the process and outcomes, though he emphasized repeatedly that the site will continue to improve. ""The thing that Git is all about is social coding,"" said Sivak, ""leveraging the community to help build projects in a better way. It's the embodiment of the open source movement, in many ways: it allows for truly democratic coding, sharing, modifications and updates in a nice interface that a lot of people use."" Sivak has high aspirations that publishing the code for Healthcare.gov will lead to a different kind of citizen engagement. ""I have this idea that when we release this code, there may be people out there who will help make improvements, maybe fork the repository, and suggest changes we can choose to add,"" he said. ""Instead of just internal consultants who help build this, we suddenly have legions of developers."" The long game for the code behind Healthcare.gov may be quite interesting, given the status of exchanges in the states. If their health insurance exchanges aren't ready or robust, they can simply pull this code and adopt it. While states and federal government sharing code might make for fertile fodder for constitutional scholars and philosophical discussions of federalism in the future, for the moment, the stakeholders all just need something that works. ""This is multi-lingual, 508-compliant, and hits on mobile,"" said Gundersen. ""So many states and fed agencies can look at this as part of a new, different way of building websites. Part of that is process-based, from the start, using tech that is faster and more flexible."" In fact, Booth says that there have already been a couple of states that have asked CMS if they can pull the code on their sites. ""We don't have to ask if you're on Microsoft, Unix or Application Server Pages,"" he said. ""It's on Github and you can pull it down. Open source is not always applicable but when it is, it's very powerful."" Not everything is innovative in the new Healthcare.gov, as Nick Judd reported at TechPresident in March: The procurement process that led to Development Seed is complicated, with some potential conflicts of interest present. The end result, however, is a small startup in a garage in DC collaborating with the federal government to relaunch one of the most important federal websites of the 21st century in a decidedly 21st-century way: cheaper, faster and scalable, using open source tools and open standards. ""This is the responsive Web of structured data,"" said Mullen. ""Create once, publish everywhere."" That's a huge win for the American people, and while the vast majority of visitors to Healthcare.gov this fall will never know or perhaps care about how the site was built, the delivery of better service at lowered cost to taxpayers is an outcome that matters to everyone. ""Open by design, open by default,"" said Sivak. ""That's what we're doing. It just makes a lot of sense. If you think about what should happen after this year, all of the states that didn't implement their systems, would it make sense for them to have code to use as their own? Or add to it? Think about the amount of money and effort that would save.""","JUNE 29, 2013"
"Healthcare, Meet Capitalism - The Atlantic",7855,"Self-described ""lunatic-fringe disruptors"" depict U.S. healthcare like one of Ayn Rand's dystopias. The $2.7 trillion industry lacks accountability for exorbitant costs. The system incentivizes doctors (and hospitals) to do tests and procedures, instead of paying them to do their jobs—keeping people healthy. It's like paying carpenters to use nails. ""I believe we are on the cusp of an oil rush—a fabulous revolution of profit-making and cost-saving in health care,"" disruptor Jonathan Bush told a rapt audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival last week. In the Rand comparison, Bush might be John Galt—were he not exuding as much benevolence as relentless capitalism. And he's not giving up on the system; he's trying to upend it. Last week I moderated a discussion that became heated—by moderated-panel standards, and by no part of mine—between Bush, Toby Cosgrove (CEO of the Cleveland Clinic), Rushika Fernandopulle (CEO of Iora Health), and Dena Bravata (CMO of Castlight Health). It ended in an emphatic plea by Bush to never donate money to a hospital. That was met with equal parts laughter and applause. From Cosgrove, seated three inches to his right, neither. To Bush, CEO and co-founder of the $4.2 billion health-technology company athenahealth healthcare is a business, driven by markets like any other. Altruism and profit-driven business need not be at odds. It's incomprehensible and unsustainable that people have no idea what their care costs and have no incentive to consider cheaper options. ""Profit is a dirty word among the corduroy-elbow crowd in the research hospitals and foundations,"" Bush wrote in his recently-released book, Where Does It Hurt? ""But just like any business, from Samsung to Dogfish Head Brewery, this industry will grow and innovate by figuring out what we need and want, and selling it to us at prices we're willing and able to pay."" In Aspen, Bush mentioned Invisalign braces and LASIK surgery as procedures that have been driven by the free market. These things started off exorbitantly expensive, but prices fell and fell. For LASIK, the procedure was ""$2,800 per eye [in the 1990s]; now it's $200 per eye, including a ride to and from the procedure."" The oft-cited, disquieting numbers—the U.S. spends the largest percentage of its GDP on healthcare of any country (by far) but ranks 42nd in global life expectancy and similarly underwhelms in many other health metrics—are projected to worsen. Massive hospitals systems are buying out their competition across the country, charging exorbitant premiums without incentive to cut costs or optimize the care they provide. Bush's gushing proposition is that when patients can ""shop"" for healthcare based on quality and price, it will drive innovation and better care. Innovation will inevitably disrupt the bloated status quo. But the current system has to be allowed to fail. That might sound bleak, but to innovators like Bush, Fernandopulle, and Bravata, it's an opportunity for reinvention. Forecasting of this sort is the currency of the Aspen conference (hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic), but Bush has the infectious passion that makes it feel like he's one of those people who, while giving a keynote on the need for change, is already halfway out the door to make something happen. Here's the second half of the discussion, which neatly explains some fundamental problems with healthcare delivery: Dena Bravata is the chief medical officer of Castlight, whose platform helps patients compare cost and quality to make informed healthcare decisions—shifting incentives for doctors toward lower-cost, higher-quality care. Rushika Fernandopulle is a primary care physician and co-founder of a small company called Iora Health that is trying to fix healthcare from the bottom up. ""We start by changing the payment system,"" Fernandopulle said, ""which I think is part of the problem. Instead of getting paid fee-for-service, we blow that up and say we should get a fixed fee for what we do. That allows us to care for a population, and our job is to keep them healthy. If you believe that, you completely change the delivery model."" Iora assigns each patient a personal health coach who does the blocking and tackling in dealing with the healthcare system. They interact by email and video chat, reaching out to patients instead of leaving the onus on the patient to follow up on their care. In Fernandopulle's view, athenahealth, which is still contingent on the current fee-for-service model, is something of a dinosaur. Fernandopulle is a disruptor of disruptors. Toby Cosgrove, the former surgeon and current CEO of one of the largest healthcare systems in the U.S., the Cleveland Clinic, cites redundancy: ""What we need to understand is that not all hospitals can be all things to all people."" The Cleveland Clinic, for example, has become expert in cardiothoracic surgery, drawing patients from across the country. In Cosgrove's model, there might be only one hospital in the country that does a certain complex procedure—but it does the procedure extremely well, efficiently, and on a scale that is maximally cost-effective. Drawing on his experience in Vietnam evacuating injured soldiers, Cosgrove argued for moving patients to expert physicians, rather than trying to have sub-sub-specialized experts everywhere. So the future of U.S. healthcare will not come in the form of more hospitals. As Cosgrove noted, we already have plenty. Hospital occupancy in the U.S. right now is 65 percent. ""Twenty years ago [the U.S.] had a million hospital beds, Cosgrove said. ""There are now 800,000, and we still have too many."" Bush recognizes that the core of healthcare is the relationship between the doctor and the patient. He says that any successful health-business model will be predicated on maximizing the act of total presence during a doctor visit. Ancillary staff will do the busy work that might keep a physician away from her patients. The doctor's undivided attention is what patients want, and giving it is what makes a doctor's job meaningful and effective. Despite demand from patients and doctors for more time together, Bush notes, the average visit is eight minutes. When large hospital systems leverage their market position and brand names to overcharge for basic services, they not only subsidize research, but they perpetuate inefficiency. A cornered market favors complacency and maintenance of the status quo. In every other industry, if you're still using a pager in 2014—as many doctors are—your business fails when your clients go to Iora Health, where they can video chat. In his book, Bush calculated the fortune that could be made if a person wanted to start their own MRI business. At Massachusetts General Hospital, an MRI can be billed to an insured patient for $5,315. Bush proposes that an industrious person could rent an MRI machine for around $8,000 per month, a suburban park office for $1,000, two technicians for $6,500 each (including benefits), and around $3,000 for taxes and fees. That's $25,000 per month in cost. If you can do three scans per hour and run twelve hours per day, you'd break even at $28 per MRI. ""The biggest lie that we baked into our thinking,"" Bush said in Aspen, is that ""starting in 1958, in the wake of World War II, the government wanted to control wage inflation, so they let employers provide healthcare as an incentive (What could go wrong? It's 1958!)—was this idea that healthcare itself is just a monolithic, identical thing. That there's no value in price shopping. That there's no value in choosing whether or not to get [a certain health service]. We act, as a society, on the unconscious level, like we're not in charge. This is a massive problem. Not just because we utilize expensive things, but because we give up the opportunity for those things to get better.""","JULY 2, 2014"
Health Care: The Biggest Issue of the 2018 Midterm Elections - The Atlantic,5882,"About the author: Annie Lowrey is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where she covers economic policy. Here’s an amazing political statistic: In 2016, the Affordable Care Act came up in just 10 percent of pro-Democrat campaign advertisements and 16 percent of pro-Republican ones. This year, it came up in more than half of Democratic ads and nearly a third of those for Republicans. Those numbers, which come from the Wesleyan Media Project, help demonstrate the way the law’s politics have gone topsy-turvy and its political sway has grown since President Donald Trump came into office. After 2016, Republicans found themselves in the position of fighting against a law that suddenly went from being unpopular to being popular. And Democrats found themselves in the position of fighting to defend its good parts rather than having to explain away its bad ones. For the first time in nearly a decade, they’re running on health care rather than away from it. Read: The midterms could permanently change North Carolina politics Health care has become the single most important policy topic in the midterm elections—everywhere and nowhere, a strange kind of omnipresent sleeper issue. It’s not grabbing many national headlines, compared with the migrant caravan or the Supreme Court fight or violence directed against minority groups or the trade war, but it’s motivating voters in race after race after race. New polling from the Public Religion Research Institute shows that Americans point to the cost of health care more than any other issue when asked what is most important to them this election cycle. “It’s official: The 2018 midterms are about health care,” Wesleyan argued. With good reason. There’s policy at stake. Ballot initiatives in three very red states—Utah, Nebraska, and Idaho—are seeking to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 300,000 people. “What we’re seeing is that health care doesn’t have to be partisan,” said Jonathan Schleifer, the executive director of the Fairness Project, an advocacy group that has supported the initiatives. “The Medicaid expansion has enormous bipartisan appeal because it’s the compassionate thing to do and the fiscally responsible thing to do.” In Washington, Republicans continue to stand queasily behind their own vaporware-type plans to repeal the ACA and replace it with something smaller and worse, while at the same time chipping away at coverage through regulatory provisions and the courts. The status quo remains fraught, too. Though the rate of American adults without insurance has dropped from 18.2 percent when the ACA passed to 10.3 percent as of 2016, nearly 30 million mostly lower-income people still lack coverage, putting their health at risk and leaving them vulnerable to bankruptcy as a result of a car accident or sudden illness. Moreover, the cost of coverage and care remains a heavy burden for millions of families, with the growth of out-of-pocket costs continuing to outstrip the growth in wages. “The debate is about this amorphous thing called ‘health care,’” said Drew Altman, the president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. “The big crisis in health care now is a crisis of out-of-pocket costs for people who are sick.” Read: What happens if Trump wins his bet on racial demagoguery? For Democrats, the pitch to those voters is straightforward: We are the party that will shore up the Affordable Care Act, maintain protections for preexisting conditions, and work to make coverage universal and affordable. For the first time in years, the party is defending a popular law rather than an unpopular one—and is doing so vocally, playing on voters’ very real fears that Republicans will take away their coverage. In Missouri, Senator Claire McCaskill is on a “Your Health Care, Your Vote” tour. In West Virginia, Senator Joe Manchin is pressing on health care, too, cutting an ad in which he blasts the lawsuit that would take away coverage for preexisting conditions with a shotgun. For Republicans, the law’s sudden popularity—and their continual efforts to reduce coverage and increase costs—have made their campaign pitch a little harder. With no real health plan to run on, many have alighted on the bizarre argument that they would protect individuals with preexisting conditions. “The president’s health-care plan,” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters last month, “covers preexisting conditions.” (That health plan does not exist in any real form.) Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and California Representative Dana Rohrabacher, among others, have gotten caught on both sides of the issue. Jemele Hill: Beto O’Rourke grabbed a political third rail—and electrified his campaign A more coherent if more fanciful Republican argument goes after Medicare for All, the Democrats’ long-term promise of providing universal public coverage. “They want to raid Medicare to pay for socialism,” Trump said at a rally in Indiana in August. Florida Governor Rick Scott, among other conservatives, has picked up the attack line. (So has the program’s federal administrator, Seema Verma, tweeting this week, “Medicare for All isn’t a joke. It’s a multi-trillion dollar drain on the American economy that will bankrupt future generations.”) But Democrats would need control of the House, Senate, and White House to turn that campaign slogan into policy reality—and at the same time, Republican leaders in Congress are promising to take another run at shrinking Medicaid and gutting Medicare. With Trump in the White House and voters focused on the health-policy details, Democrats are running for something popular and against something unpopular. Republicans have no popular plan of their own, their proposals on the issue are unpopular, and they are grasping for something to run against. And Americans are voting.","NOVEMBER 2, 2018"
The Secret Startup That Saved the Worst Website in America - The Atlantic,22547,"Loren Yu was on a weekend trip in Los Angeles when he received an urgent email from a friend. The friend, Kalvin Wang, had a proposition. ""If your response isn’t ‘no way,’ then we should talk ASAP, like tomorrow,"" Wang wrote. At the time, Yu was working for an education startup in New York called SkillShare. SkillShare had two technical employees. Yu was one of them. Wang’s proposal would take him away from the young company, but there was little question what choice Yu would make. A week later, he was on a train to Baltimore. Yu had decided to join Wang on a small team of designers and developers trying to save Healthcare.gov. Other stories have been told about the website so bad it nearly broke the Affordable Care Act. The Obama administration was ""running the biggest start-up in the world, and they didn’t have anyone who had run a start-up, or even run a business,"" David Cutler, a health adviser to Obama’s 2008 campaign, told The Washington Post in 2013. “It’s very hard to think of a situation where the people best at getting legislation passed are best at implementing it. They are a different set of skills.” Yet it’s hard to overstate just how dismal the website was. The site’s login system—the software which accepted usernames, passwords, and was used by every health-insurance applicant—had a 91 percent uptime rate. Imagine if Google.com randomly stopped returning search requests for two hours, every day, and you would be imagining a more reliable website than the one that the Obama administration introduced. On Healthcare.gov’s first day, six people successfully used it to sign up for health insurance. The spectacular failure of Healthcare.gov at launch led to the creation of what came to be known as the Tech Surge, a group of Silicon Valley developers who rescued the website from disorganized contractors and bureaucratic mismanagement. That group gave rise to the U.S. Digital Service and, to a lesser extent, 18F, two government agencies now working to improve the state of federal technology. But the story of a group called the Marketplace Lite team has yet to be told. These are the designers and developers, mostly younger than those in the Tech Surge, who stuck around after others had left. Their experience hints at just how little the Obama administration knew about the business of building a website as complex as Healthcare.gov—but, also, how much the administration has improved since then. Here is the tl;dr version of their story: Marketplace Lite, or “MPL” as they came to be known, devoted months to rewriting Healthcare.gov functions in full, working as a startup within the government and replacing contractor-made apps with ones costing one-fiftieth of the price. And when, nearly a year after the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, the website’s second open-enrollment proved much healthier than its first, it was the MPL team who celebrated. The MPL team had three great technical accomplishments over its 16-month-long life. First, it served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose. Second, it built an insurance application, called App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app. Finally, it replaced the website’s crashy login system with a functional (and much less expensive) one of its own design. It did most of this while living together in an unremarkable McMansion in suburban Maryland. So the team that started by performing bug fixes on a sprawling, struggling mass of code ended by writing critical, efficient infrastructure for the government. Yet what the MPL team accomplished philosophically may be even more important: It helped teach government bureaucrats how to think about building websites in 2015. Before he joined MPL to work on Healthcare.gov, Yu, 28, asked what he should expect his work-life balance to be like. “There’s no life, it’s just work,” he remembers being told. “It’s basically 10-hour days, seven days per week.” And so it was: In a matter of days after his first exchange with Kalvin Wang about the job, Yu took a leave of absence from Skillshare in New York and hopped on the Amtrak to Baltimore. Wang picked up Yu at the train station, made a quick stop for pizza, then whisked him off to a nearby Doubletree hotel. Yu started installing software that night. There were endless days of coding, with team members set up on the floor, on tables, and in the small lobby of the Doubletree. (They stayed in the Doubletree because they had nowhere else to go—no real office—and because the control center for Healthcare.gov was in a nondescript building nearby in Maryland.) At the time, the government’s goal for the MPL team was huge: to replace the entire section of the site in which consumers could compare health-insurance plans. In his first three days on the team, “I felt like weeks had gone by,” Yu says. The team called Marketplace Lite never actually built a working or lite version of the marketplace. The task was too complex and far-reaching. But in failing to finish it, they pushed the government to better understand technology. During this time, they began to seek permission from their own federal sub-agency to use a technology that will seem basic to programmers but which Healthcare.gov had not previously used in any way: Amazon Web Services. Along with the smartphone, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the two most critical pieces of infrastructure to the current tech boom. AWS is a data center of supercomputers sitting in Virginia and Washington state from which companies can rent storage or computational power. One AWS product lets users buy cloud storage incredibly cheaply; another handles domain-name routing; still another makes managing big databases easier. AWS and cloud services like it are the reason tech companies can scale fast. To a certain kind of developer, the availability of AWS or one of its peers is assumed and appendage-like. But the Healthcare.gov team couldn’t use them. According to rules by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services—which housed the Healthcare.gov work—AWS needed to pass a special security review before parts of Healthcare.gov could be built on it. Though the approval-seeking process began in early 2014, it dragged on for months, hampering the team’s ability to do anything. “In January, they thought it would launch in March. In March, they thought it would launch in May. In May, they thought it would launch in July,” said Rohan Bhobe, a former member of MPL. Health and Human Services did not give MPL the authority to use AWS for nearly six months. But while they were waiting, they did not sit on their haunches. They kept working, putting in longer and longer hours. “You could see left and right people were burning out,” says Yu. So during those early months, working side by side with the tech surge, MPL began to improvise. They figured out that they could use Akamai, a cloud provider that already had the government’s blessing, to launch static websites that handled complex functions in the user’s browser, rather than on an exterior server. The team successfully created a page that let users create new accounts on Healthcare.gov, replacing one of the most buggy parts of the site. Then, on March 31, 2014, the Tech Surge ended. People’s contracts ran out, and the MPL team had to decide whether to stay on as a separate entity. Its successes, even the improvised ones, were proof that MPL was actually fixing things—with or without the support they’d requested from the federal government—and they were morale boosters enough to convince some members of the team to stay on. The team members all took a few weeks of vacation and returned as a now fully stand-alone team, separate from the tech surge. Many resigned from jobs they had only taken leaves of absence from before—at least one person left Google; Yu, Skillshare—and new team members were hired. Bhobe was one of them: He joined the team from the Experience Project, a social network. It helped, too, that soon after reconvening in April 2014, the team got a treat: They accompanied other members of the tech surge to a White House party, where they were personally congratulated and thanked by the president. These were better digs than they were used to. As the tech surge ended, team members moved from the Doubletree to the CMS offices—but they didn’t have an office there. Instead, they squatted in CMS offices while various employees were at meetings. They huddled on chairs and filing cabinets. When someone returned to their office, they found another empty one. That said, the government was getting better at working with a small development team. Around the middle of 2014, the MPL team got key federal government contacts—including the testing team—to use Hipchat, a group chatroom similar to Slack. Switching to a chat client represented a huge improvement over “these huge email chains, with all these attachments,” Yu said. It also allowed small offices within CMS, such as the Healthcare.gov testing team, to quickly shoot questions and clarifications to the MPL team. Previous government attempts at using group chat had foundered, but MPL’s found more success. Why? Their effort started small, from the bottom up. At first it was only used internally, then it was expanded to several interested parties within the government, and finally it grew to include many in CMS. Though it happened organically, this mirrors exactly how Slack recommends companies adopt its products: first among small teams, then grown out. “Maybe CMS would have believed us and they would have mandated everyone use Hipchat, but by doing it that way, no one would have seen the actual value of it, and now it’s just another rule that people have to follow,” said Bhobe. It also revealed a sly use of institutional power on the part of the MPL team. In interviews, many of them repeated the same idea: that leading by example, technologically, made people more likely to try new methods than simply saying, “hey, we should all do this.” As summer began, the MPL team began looking for a more stable office. They found it in a forgettable looking house in suburban Maryland. The house sat on top of a hill, on a cul-de-sac, facing three other homes of its vintage: peak-2000s boom, with vinyl siding, hardwood floors, imported granite countertops. Down the street there was a wooden geodesic dome built in 1978, and beyond that an arcing line of high-tension towers, a cell tower, and the subdivisions of Ellicott City, Maryland. The team moved in June. The house was never well-decorated. It was missing blinds, for one; and dressers and drawers; and non-folding chairs. The dining room table (which was white and plastic and also folding) was the type you find in a church closet. The bedrooms were often just one or two beds, half-made, in a room with an open suitcase. And the main work space was where the living room should have been, facing the front door, beneath a chintzy chandelier, there were two rows of standing desks, which held laptops, big screens, tangles of colorful wire, and piles of notes. For nearly a year, this house supplied the bedrooms, office, and kitchen of the Marketplace Lite team. (This was partly for economic reasons: It is cheaper, as it turns out, to rent a house in suburban Maryland than it is to indefinitely reserve six to 10 hotel rooms.) But it also gave the team a home base and a workspace. At peak, 10 people worked in the house during the day, and six people called it their home. Even though the MPL team functioned like an internal startup, they were a startup embedded within the larger structure of government. That meant they were subject to the pressures of government code factories, even though they weren’t quite managed by them—as Bhobe put it, “all these tiers of people above developers who are managing developers at a distance.” The government’s method of running software turned on a sequential design strategy known as “the waterfall”: a central calendar, the Gantt chart to end all Gantt charts, that promulgated when every task would finish. The government tried running software development as a bureaucratic process, with project managers managing project managers, and the whole thing broke. The team instead worked in an “agile” way, which favors small, cross-disciplinary teams that stay in close communication with each other while quickly finishing iterative improvements to a product (often software). The government was eager to embrace agile methods, but it didn’t always understand them. The first time the team and the government tried to implement them together, government representatives drew up a plan for a three-month plan, complete with five carefully scheduled development sprints. “And I’m like, how is that agile? That’s a three-month plan—down to like, a plan every day of those three months. ‘What if you learn something on like the third week that changes the rest of the plan?,’” Yu remembers asking. “And they were like, oh, well it’s the rest of the plan, so it can’t change.” This tension became clearest during a tussle over deadlines. The MPL team chose not to launch App2 with a single big oomph. Instead, it rolled out the app in stages: first, to zero percent of users; then, to one percent of them; 10 percent; 20 percent; all the way up to 100 percent of users. These launch targets were just targets, and even more so, they were estimates. They could be shuffled around or imperfectly executed: The goal was to establish a product that worked and was online and could be improved on. And, in the run-up to the zero-percent target, the MPL team began to change the parameters. Developers realized they could drop one planned feature in exchange for totally fixing another, and they notified their government bosses that this is what it planned to do. “We thought it wasn’t a big deal,” Yu told me. But the government, he says, replied with a message like: “How can we launch to zero percent of people if those things aren’t done?” “There’s whole tiers of organizations especially in these large contracting organizations that do nothing but manage the schedule, so if the schedule is slipping, that’s their highest alarm bell going off,” Bhobe says. It was partly a communication failure: The team had not fully understood the government’s assumptions about what a release date should be. But it also revealed how the government did not understand agile, even as it said it valued the technique. (Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services declined repeated requests for comment.) It was not the government’s first time trying to be agile during the development of Healthcare.gov, either. Some of the original contracts for the website specified that contractors would follow an agile technique so as to develop software more quickly. It was many of these same contracts that went awry and created vast cost overruns. According to the Government Accountability Office, that happened because CMS failed to do proper oversight on them—struggled to know how to do oversight on agile—and because these contracts were also “cost-plus-fixed-fee,” where the contractor was reimbursed for costs it encountered while making the site. The MPL team’s experience seemed to show that even with teams more experienced at agile, many government employees struggle to adapt to the process. Instead of building a marketplace app, the team instead created a new application for health insurance. Though designed at first just for call centers, the new app proved so popular that eventually CMS rolled it out to everyone with an uncomplicated medical history. About 65 percent of all new users wound up using this “App 2.0.” The team finished rolling out App 2.0 in the fall of 2014. Open enrollment, when ordinary Americans could begin signing up for insurance again, began on November 15, 2014. Other than a minor, quickly fixed snag at the beginning, a process wholly different from the previous year’s elapsed over the following three months. People logged on. They entered their information. They bought insurance. Healthcare.gov worked. And App 2.0, in particular, worked very well. Users finish it in about nine minutes, according to Bhobe, where they took 20 minutes to complete the previous version. App 2.0 is responsive, meaning it works on all types of screens, desktop and mobile; and it takes many fewer pages to direct a user from start to finish. Where the previous version required a user to flip through some 76 pages, App 2.0 uses, at most, 16. Perhaps because of that brevity, 85 percent of all users get through it. Only 55 percent of users managed to complete the first version. Bhobe chalks this up, in part, to good software-design strategy. The MPL team worked to get the government to articulate the needs the software needed to satisfy, then designed solutions to meet them. “The thing about needs is, you don’t mix the solution with the need, so you actually say, this is a need we need to solve. And you use the creativity and the energy of the team to figure out what the best way to address that might be,” he told me. The team kept working, though. Their new goal—one they had originally wanted to finish by November—was to build a login system to replace the website’s original ailing one. It’s worth lingering on the first login system for a moment. Instead of using a new database for Healthcare.gov users, it stored data in literally the same database used to house federal government employee information. This did not make it any more stable: It still caused about half the Healthcare.gov outages. (""There were a lot of outages,"" Yu said.) This now-bloated database was overtaxed. Catastrophic failure became a regular occurrence. Sometimes only a couple of components would break without notifying the rest, leading to a notorious error nicknamed “lost souls,” in which someone could successfully create an account but never receive the confirmation email saying they’d done so. It also indexed family members by presuming everyone would have a unique birthday—meaning twins couldn’t both have accounts. This final development saga, though it was the hardest product to make, was in some ways the easiest yet. The government and MPL were better at working together, and both knew better what the other ones were expecting. MPL did not need to propose an agile technique only to watch the government draw up a Gantt chart for it. And the new login system, which MPL launched in February 2015, is remarkable. It is faster and it is cheaper than the old one: The old system responded to requests somewhere between two and 10 long seconds; the new one takes 30 milliseconds, on average. The old login system cost $250 million to build and would have required another $70 million annually to stay online. The new system cost about $4 million to build, and its annual maintenance cost is a little less than $1 million. MPL has now disbanded, but it’s not gone forever. In mid-May, it incorporated as a new company, a public-benefit corporation called Nava. Bhobe and Yu and others have left the house and moved to Washington. And what of the house? It’s empty now: In April, its remaining five residents gave away their Ikea lanterns and blue velvet sofas on Craigslist and moved to Washington, D.C., or back to San Francisco. The MPL team was not the ideal workforce: They were (and remain) contractors to contractors. They were not protected by a union, nor did they enjoy the many benefits of working as public employees. They are coders-for-hire who could relocate across the country quickly, and they reflect the larger industry they work in: Mostly young, mostly male, and highly educated. It does not have to be this way. This kind of precarious employment—lucrative, quasi-nomadic—is as much the result of poor planning as a natural consequence of writing code for a living. Instead, if the successes of the MPL team confirm any guiding principle for the future, it is this: Technical workers—not only engineers but designers—have to be involved with a process from the beginning. They will know that features must be described separately from needs, and that, when building software, smaller teams often perform better than larger teams. Talking to MPL team members, I was struck by how many of the problems were fixed simply by having a devoted workforce willing to just do the work and fix the bugs. The Government Accountability Office blames the failure of the first Healthcare.gov in part on the government’s changing requirements for the website and its poor risk management—especially of the agile process. But the MPL team’s experience hints that contractors, or at least their government supervisors, were less actually using agile methods than aping its lingo. Team members found the government averse to the agile process because, to quote Yu, they asked, “what if there’s bugs?” But there will always be bugs. For a website is not a tank: It’s not constructed piece by piece, and assigning more people to work on it does not get it finished it any faster. Most importantly, the government can’t decree what it wants and expect a perfect deliverable, otherwise the government will receive software that meets every specification except the important one: that it works. That’s one reason why the government’s own internal efforts to get a handle on technology—notably, 18F and the U.S. Digital Service—are just as important as Nava’s. And Nava, indeed, hopes to keep branching out. Bhobe said the company intends to realize a larger goal, of turning some government IT services into application programming interfaces, or APIs, that can then be used either by the government or by private companies. In other words, instead of Healthcare.gov being the only way to access the federal insurance marketplace, a swath of sites could access the same database and serve competing marketplaces with different interfaces. Bhobe compared the final, imagined product to the federal highway system: There are laws about the specifications of the roads have to be and where they go, but ultimately private companies build and populate businesses around them. Is this a ridiculous, far-off goal? Perhaps. But the federal government is already in the business of building critical information infrastructure—it just normally does it with paper and forms signed in triplicate. Now, with the help of Nava and others, it might figure out how to do it with code.","JULY 9, 2015"
What American Healthcare Can Learn From Germany - The Atlantic,13068,"Last fall, Sam, an American woman who lives in Berlin, began to experience stomach pain while eating and drinking. She visited her general practitioner, who wrote her a prescription. The problem hadn't gone away several days later, so the doctor referred her to a specialist for a gastroscopy. Her issue wasn’t deemed an emergency, though, so she had to wait about two weeks for an appointment. “But man, was I impressed with the exam itself!” she later told me in an email. “Went to the hospital, filled out a few papers, was knocked out for a bit while they looked in my stomach, and was home again a few hours later. Everything was very efficient.” The best part: Sam paid exactly nothing for the experience. Instead, the bill was paid by the Barmer GEK sickness fund, one of about 160 such nonprofit insurance collectives in the country. Every German resident must belong to a sickness fund, and in turn the funds must insure all comers. They’re also mandated to cover a standard set of benefits, which includes most procedures and medications. Workers pay half the cost of their sickness fund insurance, and employers pay the rest. The German government foots the bill for the unemployed and for children. There are also limits on out-of-pocket expenses, so it’s rare for a German to go into debt because of medical bills. Sound familiar? It should, since this is very similar to the health-insurance regime that Americans are now living under, now that the Affordable Care Act is four years old and a few days past its first enrollment deadline. All Americans are now required to have health insurance or to pay a fine, and insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone, regardless of pre-existing conditions. Obamacare has also created subsidies for those who can’t afford to buy health insurance and has implemented limits on out-of-pocket costs. There are, of course, a few key differences. Co-pays in the German system are minuscule, about 10 euros per visit. Even those for hospital stays are laughably small by American standards: Sam payed 40 euro for a three-day stay for a minor operation a few years ago. Included in that price was the cost of renting the TV remote. And nearly five million Americans fall into what’s called the “Medicaid gap” in states that aren’t expanding the government health insurance program for the poor. These individuals make too much to qualify for the state’s existing Medicaid program (typically just a few thousand dollars a year for childless adults), yet too little to qualify for the federal government’s subsidies to buy health insurance on the new exchanges, so they will remain uninsured. In Germany, employees' premiums are a percentage of their incomes, so low-wage workers simply pay rock-bottom insurance rates. The sickness funds are Germany's version of a “public” health insurance system, and it covers nearly everyone. But a small segment (13 percent) of the population, generally the very wealthy, can opt-out and instead go with the private Krankenversicherung, which follows rules more similar the pre-Obamacare U.S. individual insurance market. But those differences aside, it’s fair to say the U.S. is moving in the direction of systems like Germany’s—multi-payer, compulsory, employer-based, highly regulated, and fee-for-service. You can think of this setup as the Goldilocks option among all of the possible ways governments can insure health. It's not as radical as single-payer models like the U.K.’s, where the government covers everyone. And it's also not as brutal as the less-regulated version of the insurance market we had before the ACA. “I think you’re moving more in the direction of international standards,” Dirk Göpffarth, head of risk adjustment at the German Federal Social Insurance Office, told me. “The U.S. was always the odd one out with not regulating healthcare until everyone goes into Medicare.” Germany actually pioneered this type of insurance—it all started when Otto von Bismarck signed his Health Insurance Bill of 1883 into law. (It’s still known as the “Bismarck model” because of his legacy, and other parts of Europe and Asia have adopted it over the years.) But that’s not to say that the Bismarck model is without its problems. In fact, Germany shares many healthcare woes with the U.S., and it’s tried some intriguing solutions that Americans might look to, as well. So, with our healthcare system looking decidedly more German, here’s what we have to look forward to. All things considered, it’s good to be a sick German. There are no network limitations, so people can see any doctor they want. There are no deductibles, so Germans have no fear of spending hundreds before their insurance ever kicks in. There’s also no money that changes hands during a medical appointment. Patients show their insurance card at the doctor’s office, and the doctors' association pays the doctor using money from the sickness funds. ""You don’t have to sit at home and sort through invoices or wonder if you overlooked fine print,” Sophia Schlette, a public health expert and a former senior advisor at Berlin’s National Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Association, told me. That insurance card, by the way, is good for hospital visits anywhere in Europe. Germany is in the middle of the pack among developed countries when it comes to healthcare spending per capita, according to a report released by the Commonwealth Fund last fall. But of all of the countries studied, Germans were the most likely to be able to get a same-day or next-day appointment and to hear back from a doctor quickly if they had a question. They rarely use emergency rooms, and they can access doctors after-hours with ease. And Germany manages to put its health-care dollars to relatively good use: For each $100 it spends on healthcare, it extends life by about four months, according to a recent analysis in the American Journal of Public Health. In the U.S., one of the worst-performing nations in the ranking, each $100 spent on healthcare resulted in only a couple of extra weeks of longevity. Then, of course, there are the drawbacks. Since there are no provider networks in Germany, doctors don’t know what other providers patients have seen, so there are few ways to limit repeat procedures. In fact, Germany is facing quantity-control issues similar to America’s, but the U.S. is more of a vanguard in attempting to limit waste. The ACA created Accountable Care Organizations, voluntary groups of doctors and nurses that can share in the savings if they manage to treat Medicare patients more efficiently. The German government is similarly trying to push more people into “family physician” programs, in which just one doctor would serve as a gatekeeper. But that’s an idea the Germans borrowed from the American HMO model of the 1980s. And like the U.S., Germany may see a shortage of primary-care doctors in the near future, both because primary-care doctors there don’t get paid as much as specialists, and because entrenched norms have prevented physician assistants from shouldering more responsibility, Schlette said. There are so few nurses available to provide geriatric care that Germans have started importing their own home health aides from Eastern Europe or the Philippines. The German government is also currently trying to lure more primary care doctors to rural areas, where staffing issues are much worse than in affluent towns and cities—just like in, well, you guessed it. The mandatory German insurance can also get rather expensive. Sam pays 355 euros a month for her sickness fund because as a freelancer, she’s responsible for both the employer- and employee-paid portions. And in one 2010 survey, nearly as many Germans (16 percent) as Americans (17 percent) said they spent a lot of time on medical paperwork or disputes. With limitations on how much they can charge, German doctors and hospitals instead try to pump up their earnings by performing as many procedures as possible, just like American providers do. “Is the system good?” Schlette said. “Well, maybe, but there is a lot of oversupply of care and poor care coordination.” With few resource constraints, healthcare systems like America's and Germany's tend to go with the most expensive treatment option possible. An American might find himself in an MRI machine for a headache that a British doctor would have treated with an aspirin and a smile. Similarly, “In Germany, it will always be an operation,” Göpffarth said. “Meanwhile, France and the U.K. tend to try drugs first and operations later.” Perhaps the biggest difference between our two approaches is the extent to which Germany has managed to rein in the cost of healthcare for consumers. Prices for procedures there are lower and more uniform because doctors’ associations negotiate their fees directly with all of the sickness funds in each state. That's part of the reason why an appendectomy costs $3,093 in Germany, but $13,000 in the U.S. “In Germany, there is a uniform fee schedule for all physicians that work under the social code,” Schlette said. “There’s a huge catalogue where they determine meticulously how much is billed for each procedure. That’s like the Bible.” In the U.S., meanwhile, a trip to the doctor or hospital is still a roulette of billing discrepancies and not-covered expenses. Obamacare, meanwhile, has tried to cut healthcare costs primarily by taking aim at the number of unnecessary procedures. Medicare’s payments to hospitals are now partly tied to readmission rates, and last year Medicare punished more than 2,000 hospitals for not doing a better job of keeping patients out of the ER. There have also been 114 Accountable Care Organizations created, but so far only 29 have saved enough money to qualify for bonus payments. And there are still more cost-cutting measures to come, like taxes on “Cadillac,” or very generous, health plans. Some experts think American customers might become more cost-conscious as they move onto stingier healthcare plans. And certain U.S. states have tried a more German strategy, attempting to keep costs low by setting prices across the board. Maryland, for example, has been regulating how much all of the state’s hospitals can charge since 1977. A 2009 study published in Health Affairs found that we would have saved $2 trillion if the entire country’s health costs had grown at the same rate as Maryland’s over the past three decades. Now, Maryland is going a step further still, having just launched a plan to cap the amount each hospital can spend, total, each year. The state's hospital spending growth will be limited to 3.58 percent for the next five years. “We know that right now, the more [doctors] do, the more they get paid,” John Colmers, executive director of Maryland’s Health Services Cost Review Commission, told me. “We want to say, ‘The better you do, the better you get paid.’” Two other small, left-leaning states, Vermont and Massachusetts, are experimenting with similar measures, but some experts doubt that this sort of top-down thriftiness can be imposed in every state, or even in most states. As we’ve seen from the bitter fight over Medicaid expansion, conservative states tend to balk at government directives. “These states are all unabashedly in the new (or rediscovered) category of states who recognize that the authority of government is an essential ingredient to finding a sustainable level of total health spending,” John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, told me. “The red states are unlikely to follow their lead. The notion that government may be a big part of the solution, instead of the problem, is anathema, and Republican controlled legislatures, and their governors, would find it too substantial a conflict to pursue with any vigor.” What’s more, no other state has Maryland’s uniform, German-style payment system in place, “so Maryland starts the race nine paces ahead of the other 46 states,” McDonough said. In a 2012 report on the German and American healthcare systems, Göpffarth pointed out that though the U.S. and Germany are both desperately trying to make healthcare less expensive, the unique spirit of each country is what ultimately gets in its way. Germany’s more orderly system can be too rigid for experimentation. And America’s free-for-all, where hospitals and doctors all charge different amounts, is great for innovation but too chaotic to make payment reforms stick. In fact, Göpffarth thinks rising health costs will continue to be the main problem for Americans as we launch into our more Bismarckian system. “The main challenge you’ll have is price control,” he said. “You have subsidies in health exchanges now, so for the first time, the federal budget is really involved in health expenditure increases in the commercial market. In order to keep your federal budget under control, you’ll have to control prices.” And though we’ve followed the lead of Germany and other European systems to get where we are now, no country has quite figured out that last part yet.","APRIL 8, 2014"
Why the U.S. Health-Care System Is So Bad - The Atlantic,744,"According to the Commonwealth Fund, which regularly ranks the health systems of a handful of developed countries, the best countries for health care are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Australia. The lowest performer? The United States, even though it spends the most. “And this is consistent across 20 years,” said the Commonwealth Fund’s president, David Blumenthal, on Friday at the Spotlight Health Festival, which is co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic. Blumenthal laid out three reasons why the United States lags behind its peers so consistently. It all comes down to: Together, these reasons help explain why U.S. life expectancy has, for the first time since the 1960s, recently gone down for two years in a row.","JUNE 22, 2018"
Cities Are Eliminating the Healthcare Benefits Once Promised to Retirees - The Atlantic,8638,"When Kenneth Blair joined the Detroit police force decades ago at age 19, he thought he was signing up for a steady job—and pension and health-care benefits for life. The fate of his pension is still up in the air as Detroit’s bankruptcy makes its way through the courts. But Blair’s health benefits as he would have known them are already gone. Blair died in 2004 after serving on the police force for 30 years, and his benefits were transferred to his wife Cynthia. She received a pension check and was enrolled in the same medical plan offered to current employees of the city of Detroit. For $125 a month, Blair could see almost any doctor she wanted; for $25 more, she got full dental and vision coverage. But then the city of Detroit decided it wanted to get out of the business of offering retirees healthcare. Public-employee unions were unable to prevent the change. So in December of last year, Blair and thousands of other retirees got a letter informing them that anyone under 65 “would need to obtain their own health insurance coverage” as of March 1 of this year. It recommended that they check out the health-care exchanges set up under Obamacare. “I was shocked. I still am shocked. I’m still reeling from it,” said Blair, 60, who, like many retirees, assumed that the city would continue to offer healthcare to retirees, since her husband had been promised lifetime healthcare. “It’s such a big amount of money coming out of my pension.” Employers have a legal obligation to continue paying pensions, although bankruptcy can change that. But most legal experts would agree that employers can do away or dramatically change health insurance for retirees—even if they had promised it for life. Take GM, for example: In the '70s and '80s, employees received notice that “your basic health-care coverages will be provided at GM's expense for your lifetime,” but a court later ruled that GM could alter or do away with coverage. “Health insurance doesn’t have the same degree of protection that the pension plans do,” said Robert Clark, an economics professor at North Carolina State University. Indeed, public employers across the country may soon begin following Detroit’s lead and withdrawing coverage for retirees, instead sending them to the health-care exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. “Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I think it is fair to say that every public-sector employer is looking at the exchanges as a potential way to get out of the unfunded liabilities that the public sector is bearing,” said Olivia Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council and a Wharton professor. “People are becoming more expensive to take care of.” Last year, for instance, Chicago announced that it was phasing out health-care benefits for people who retired after August 23, 1989. And Sheboygan County, Wisconsin also voted last year to stop allowing county retirees to use the county’s health-insurance plan, instead shifting them onto the health-care exchanges. “We had to make a decision about what we could afford, and we’re obligated to fund pensions by law, but not health-care benefits,"" said Bill Nowling, a spokesman for Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr. “I know it sounds crass, but we can’t afford it.” Detroit was spending $180 million a year for healthcare for its current employees and retirees; once it moved the retirees to the exchanges, costs dropped to $60 million, Nowling said. ""Ford, GM, and Chrysler got out of retiree health care years ago,"" he said. For Blair, the public exchanges represented less choice and more money. She bought an HMO plan though the exchange, which costs her $449 a month, although she receives a $125 subsidy from the city. It was a more frustrating plan, she said: Doctors in the HMO were overbooked and she wasn’t able to schedule appointments for weeks or months. She paid $100 to see an out-of-network doctor when she needed blood pressure medication but couldn’t get an appointment in network. A doctor wanted her to have a mammogram and a colonoscopy, but she put it off, since she couldn’t afford the co-pays. “We retirees are really in a no-win situation,” she said, in an interview. “This has been a nightmare, and I’m in decent shape compared to some people.” Health insurance for retirees used to come standard with most jobs. It was one more way for employers to try to recruit the best and the brightest during booming economies. But the private sector started doing away with retiree healthcare in the 1990s after regulators required companies report their liability for retiree medical plans. In 1988, about 66 percent of private-sector employers offered retiree health care; by 2013, only 25 percent did, said Mitchell, of the Pension Research Council. But the public sector has been slower to do away with retiree healthcare, in part because strong unions have continued to negotiate for the benefit. Nearly 80 percent of state and local government organizations still offer retiree healthcare, Mitchell said. But the plans are extremely costly for governments already struggling with budget problems, and they only keep getting more expensive as health care costs continue to rise. While there are $800 billion in unfunded pension liabilities from public-sector employers across the country, unfunded retiree health-care liabilities are pretty big, too, at $627 billion. The decision by public sector employers to take away benefits that they had long promised has angered many retirees, and an advocacy group, ProtectOurSeniors.org, has supported a bill introduced this year in Congress that would prevent companies—public and private—from taking away earned health-care benefits. The bill would also require companies that filed for bankruptcy to pay retiree pensions for at least three years. “Post-retirement health benefits are not entitlements, they are earned benefits that were paid for by workers and guaranteed by employers,” said Jack Brennan, chairman of the Association of BellTell Retirees, in a statement earlier this year after the bill was introduced. Public employee retirees who begin using the exchanges will find a very different type of health care, said Amanda Starc, a Wharton professor who studies health care management. The plans have higher deductibles and a smaller network. And, unless they get subsidies, the retirees will also find the plans expensive. “They’re going to get some sticker shock,” she said. “They’re going to be asked to pay a little bit more for a little bit less.” Shifting retirees onto the exchanges could have repercussions for people across the country, Starc said, because it could skew the pool of people in the exchanges. The more old, sick people and the fewer young, healthy people are in the exchanges, the higher costs will go for everybody. But it doesn’t have to be all bad. The exchanges could increase transparency and give public-sector retirees more options, said Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Some retirees who can’t afford the health plans will qualify for subsidies, and the exchanges will force retirees to be more active in their healthcare. It's possible that one day the Detroit retirees could even long for the exchanges. The unions have decided that next year, retirees will get out of the exchanges and be covered under a Voluntary Employee Benefits Association, which is kind of like a private exchange. The city is only obligated to contribute $400 million into it over 20 years, which is a fraction of the $120 million it had been spending annually on retiree health care. Many retirees will see their pensions shrink by 4.5 percent if Detroit's bankruptcy plan is approved. But the amount of money they're paying for medical bills could mushroom. That’s bound to cause angst for people who are already grappling with how to survive on less money than they’d planned for. Roger Rice was a Department of Public Works employee for 38 years. He and his wife were covered under the city health plan, until the city couldn’t afford it anymore. He turned 65 and was covered by Medicare, but she isn’t yet of Medicare age, so the couple pays $700 a month for health insurance. That made things very expensive when she had a heart attack—because of the stress, he said, when testifying in Detroit’s bankruptcy trial. His pension will likely be cut 4.5 percent when the bankruptcy is approved, and with the $700 health care bill, he said, the amount of money he earns every year has been cut by half. “Can you imagine my answer when someone asks how I’m enjoying my retirement?” he said.","OCTOBER 14, 2014"
Universal Health Care: Is It Constitutional? - The Atlantic,6930,"The heart of the challenge to the new federal health-care program is this image: an individual is doing nothing at all, bothering no one, when suddenly a federal bureaucrat appears and requires him or her to buy a commercial product or pay a tax. The program's opponents claim that, in the guise of regulating commercial activity, it regulates ""inactivity."" This, it is claimed, is unprecedented and tyrannical. Three federal courts so far have taken a first look at the argument. One, in Michigan, rejected it. The second, in Virginia, indicated that it needs careful consideration. The third, Thursday's ruling from a District Court in Florida, bought it hook, line, and sinker. When I read the argument about whether the government can regulate ""inactivity,"" though, I can't help thinking about Ollie's Barbecue in Birmingham, Alabama. Ollie's was a neighborhood eatery. It never advertised. And when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Ollie's owner went to court to argue that Congress could not possibly regulate his private, local business and its personal decision of whom not to serve. A three-judge federal panel agreed: ""No case has been called to our attention... which has held that the national government has the power to control the conduct of people on the local level because they may happen to trade sporadically with persons who may be traveling in interstate commerce."" At the time that decision was rendered, those arguments were taken quite seriously. Discrimination on private property was ""private,"" it was argued, even when that property was open to the public; unless the owner chose to involve the property in interstate commerce, Congress was overstepping the Commerce Power in trying to regulate it. Fortunately for us all--including the people, black and white, of the South--the Supreme Court rejected this argument and sustained the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That Act, more than any other single piece of legislation or court decision, is what made the United States a single, prosperous, unified market. No one (except Rand Paul), looking back, can muster any real regret that the Ollie's Barbecues of the nation were compelled to assist in their own success. And few people today would seriously argue that a local business that discriminates is somehow not affecting commerce. Now the argument is advanced that the individual who chooses to do without insurance for his or her family is making a purely private choice, like not liking Brussels sprouts. ""Those who fall under the individual mandate either comply with it, or they are penalized,"" wrote Judge Roger Vinson in the decision of the Florida court. ""It is not based on an activity that they make the choice to undertake."" One can agree with Judge Vinson up to a point and still believe he got the issue completely wrong. The tax penalty imposed by the new legislation on individuals who refuse to insure their families really isn't based on something most of them can choose to do or not to do. It's based on something they almost certainly do not, and probably cannot, refuse to do: consume health care services. No matter how thrifty and antisocial any of us may be, no matter how devoted to homeopathy and Yoga, eventually virtually all of us will end up in an emergency room, hospital, or hospice. Even if by extraordinary effort we prevail on others to stand by and allow us to bleed out on the rumpus-room floor, we usually cannot convince them, no matter how earnestly we plead, to let our children die; state law will require they be treated. And someone will pay the cost. That you were ""inactive"" in getting them the care your children require should not exempt you from being the one who pays their bills. Before health reform opponents decided that health care is not commerce, they used to point out that health care consumes one-sixth of our gross domestic product. The argument that we aren't affecting commerce is like the argument that a segregated Ollie's wasn't influencing commerce. Of course it was; of course we are. The only real issue, as the government has pointed out, is how and when we will pay for the services we will consume. To deny Congress the power to regulate that impact on the ground that the individual doesn't ""choose"" to have it is in essence to substitute let's-pretend for grown-up economics. When the Constitution was ratified, a certain number of Americans really exist outside interstate commerce. They raised food crops for themselves, wore homespun clothing, used no ""cash money,"" and often never ventured more than a few miles from where they were born. Had George Washington descended on their cabins brandishing mandatory insurance, they would have had every right to question his constitutional warrant. That country and those people are gone; there is no way to live outside of commerce any more. Most of these inveighing against the ""individual mandate"" are wearing clothes made in China, eating food grown in Mexico, watching Fox News Channel programming bounced off satellites, and consuming prescription drugs developed with federal research funding. Their decision to put off insuring their families has a huge impact on their neighbors and on the nation as a whole. Congress would not have power over ""commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes"" if it could not reach that choice. And the Constitution--the one the right claims to revere--says it does. In considering the Ollie's Barbecue case, Justice Hugo Black (an Alabaman himself) agreed that the Commerce Power could reach even a small restaurant like Ollie's. In a concurrence, though, he wrote, ""I recognize too that some isolated and remote lunchroom which sells only to local people and buys almost all its supplies in the locality may possibly be beyond the reach of the power of Congress to regulate commerce."" Ollie's, he said, wasn't such a place. Similarly, there may be a Grizzly Adams living in the hills of Idaho who lives only on what he grows, wears only what he weaves, and hasn't heard the news that Lincoln was shot. If the Act's opponents can produce this recluse, I will write an amicus brief supporting his challenge to the tax penalty as it applies to him--assuming, that is, that he actually has managed to generate, entirely from intra-state commerce, enough income to be required to file a federal tax return-- since if not he will be immune to the penalty. Virginia AG Ken Cuccinelli and Florida AG Bill McCollum are not such creatures; neither are the millions of citizens whom they seek to ""liberate"" from modern universal health coverage. If those citizens truly object to the tax, they don't need a court's permission to vote out those who enacted it. Bad as that would be, it would be a far better outcome than having a Judge set the Act aside, based on the fantasy that we can all stay out of commerce if we just don't clap our hands.","OCTOBER 18, 2010"
The Drug That Could Break American Health Care - The Atlantic,10953,"About the authors: Nicholas Bagley is a law professor at the University of Michigan. Rachel Sachs is a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration overruled—to much criticism—its own scientific advisory committee and approved the Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm. The agency made this decision despite thin evidence of the drug’s clinical efficacy and despite its serious side effects, including brain swelling and bleeding. As a result, a serious risk now exists that millions of people will be prescribed a drug that does more harm than good. Less appreciated is how the drug’s approval could trigger hundreds of billions of dollars of new government spending, all without a vote in Congress or indeed any public debate over the drug’s value. Aduhelm’s manufacturer, Biogen, announced on Monday that it would price the drug at an average of $56,000 a year per patient, a figure that doesn’t include the additional imaging and scans needed to diagnose patients or to monitor them for serious side effects. The federal government will bear the brunt of the new spending. The overwhelming majority of people with Alzheimer’s disease are eligible for Medicare, the federally run insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans. If even one-third of the estimated 6 million people with Alzheimer’s in the United States receives the new treatment, health-care spending could swell by $112 billion annually. To put that figure in perspective, in 2020, Medicare spent about $90 billion on prescription drugs for 46 million Americans through the Part D program, which covers prescription medication that you pick up at your local pharmacy. We could wind up spending more than that for Aduhelm alone. Most of the costs will be borne by taxpayers. But Medicare beneficiaries will take an additional hit. Because Aduhelm is an infusion drug that will be administered in doctors’ offices and clinics, not taken at home, it will be covered by Medicare Part B—not Part D. Under Part B, beneficiaries pay 20 percent of the costs of their care, which, for a single year of Aduhelm treatment, will be at least $11,200. Although most seniors have supplemental plans to cover these out-of-pocket expenses, prices for those plans are sure to spike, whether they’re on Aduhelm or not. That would be quite hard on seniors, many of whom live on fixed incomes. States will also come under pressure. Some patients prescribed the drug will be under 65 and won’t be eligible for Medicare. But they may be eligible for Medicaid, which state and federal governments jointly fund. Plus, about 12 million people nationally are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (they’re called “dual eligibles”), meaning that the states are responsible for covering much of their out-of-pocket costs. As a result, states could face hundreds of millions of dollars in unanticipated Medicaid spending. That’s an especially big problem because, unlike the federal government, states aren’t allowed to run a budget deficit. To pay for Aduhelm, they’ll have to either raise taxes or (more likely, given today’s political environment) cut spending on education, infrastructure, and health care. That dynamic played out after the 2013 FDA approval of Sovaldi, a cure for people with chronic hepatitis C. Despite Sovaldi’s stunning efficacy, its price tag and the prevalence of hepatitis C in the Medicaid population posed severe budgetary challenges for states, many of which rationed access to the drug. The similarly priced Aduhelm is approved for an even larger patient population, but unlike Sovaldi, it’s not a cure. States could be stuck paying for a patient’s Aduhelm year after year, rather than simply once. Read: Big Pharma’s go-to defense of soaring drug prices doesn’t add up The decision to approve Aduhelm is thus likely to increase the federal deficit, squeeze state budgets, and force additional costs onto seniors—all for a drug that may not work. Yet the FDA has no authority to consider the broader fiscal consequences of its decision. It focuses not on dollars and cents, but on safety and efficacy—and even on that metric, physicians widely criticized the decision. This situation underscores a big problem in how we pay for drugs in the United States. In theory, one regulator’s decision about whether to approve a drug for sale could be entirely separate from another regulator’s decision of whether to spend public resources on it—and if so, how much. That’s how most countries do it. Here in the United States, however, a mix of legal constraints and political obstacles leaves the government little choice about whether to cover approved drugs. FDA approval and payment policies are tightly linked. The big question now is whether Aduhelm finally breaks that link. The reasons for the linkage between FDA approval and government spending go back to 1965, when Congress created Medicare. To overcome political opposition, as the program’s chief architect later explained, supporters had to “promise” that “there would be no real controls over hospitals and physicians.” That kind of deal might have seemed reasonable at the time, when health-care spending amounted to about 5 percent of GDP. Today, however, that figure stands at 17.7 percent. Formally, Medicare won’t pay for medical care that is “not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.” In line with the original deal, however, Medicare denies only about 3 percent of claims that hospitals and physicians submit to it. The law is also ambiguous about whether Medicare can consider costs in deciding what to cover. Is a drug “not reasonable and necessary” because it’s too expensive for the clinical value it provides? Or is Medicare committed to paying for all medically necessary care, costs be damned? And is a drug “medically necessary” just because the FDA has approved it, even if a clinical benefit for the drug has not yet been demonstrated? On three occasions since the early 1980s, Medicare has explored the possibility of excluding coverage for certain cost-ineffective treatments. Each time, medical interest groups have mobilized to defeat those efforts, as the health-policy scholar Susan Bartlett Foote described in 2002. Embattled, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now says that “cost is not a factor in our review or decision to cover a particular technology.” Medicare’s passive, cost-blind approach means that, under Part B, it pays for pretty much any approved drug that a physician prescribes. From an individual patient’s perspective, that’s comforting: No one likes the idea that Medicare might limit access to approved drugs. For society as a whole, however, it’s disconcerting. When Medicare pays for expensive drugs that don’t offer much clinical value, it both squanders taxpayer dollars that could be put to better use and increases costs for patients. The way that Medicare pays for drugs exacerbates the problem. The program is not structured to negotiate with manufacturers, which spurs drug companies to set high prices. Worse still, Medicare also pays prescribing physicians 6 percent of a drug’s average sales price, a practice that encourages physicians to prescribe more expensive drugs. At an average price of $56,000 for Aduhelm, a physician stands to earn $3,360 for every annual prescription—which is likely to generate a lot of prescriptions. Medicare does have one mechanism for pushing back on novel technologies. Every year, CMS issues a handful of what are called “national coverage determinations,” or NCDs, which specify when and under what circumstances Medicare will pay for certain treatments. In general, NCDs aren’t outright bans on care. Instead, they channel treatment to those who stand to benefit most from it. In very rare cases, CMS has considered using NCDs to limit coverage for FDA-approved drugs, most notably when it proposed restricting coverage of expensive CAR T-cell cancer therapies to people who were enrolled in CMS-approved trials. The basic idea, known as “coverage with evidence development,” was to allow the agency to collect additional data about who stood to benefit before agreeing to pay for the drug more broadly. The agency could take a similar approach to Aduhelm, as some health-policy experts have recently urged. Sarah Elizabeth Richards: When a treatment costs $450,000 or more, it had better work CMS ultimately declined to restrict Medicare coverage for CAR T. It’s not hard to see why. In the case of CAR T, unlike that of Aduhelm, there was no question that the drugs were effective. It would have been difficult for Medicare to say that it was not yet persuaded by the same evidence that had already persuaded the FDA. Alternatively, CMS could have conceded that the drugs were effective, but decided that their costs were excessive when compared to their benefits. But that would have provoked a political firestorm over rationing, not to mention litigation over the agency’s authority to consider costs in the first place. Will Medicare also cover Aduhelm? That’s what happens with most drugs, and it may be the path of least resistance. Despite the FDA’s approval, however, the shaky clinical evidence that the drug works and its budget-busting price tag may force the agency to take a more assertive approach. If so, it would mark a seismic change in how Medicare thinks about covering new drugs of marginal effectiveness. Congress may also possibly decide that it has no choice but to act. Already, doing something to curb drug spending has bipartisan support, even if Republicans and Democrats are far apart on what that something actually is. Maybe Aduhelm can shake loose some kind of grand bargain, even in a politically toxic environment. If it doesn’t, the consequences for state budgets could be dire. Under a 1990 law, state Medicaid programs must cover essentially all drugs approved by the FDA, however expensive the drugs are and however slim their clinical benefits may be. There’s a near-total link between approval and coverage. (In exchange for this mandatory coverage, manufacturers have to give Medicaid a break on their usual prices, but that’s not much of a consolation when those prices are very high.) Even if a state thought that the FDA had acted recklessly in approving Aduhelm, it would face serious legal risks if it tried to restrict coverage. Which brings us back to where we started. The FDA’s decision was only supposed to be about the science—whether Aduhelm is safe and effective for treating Alzheimer’s. But because of how we’ve structured our health-care system, the FDA’s decision will effectively transfer many billions of dollars of government and patient money to a single drug manufacturer. Whether that’s a good use of our collective resources is not a question that the FDA considered. But it’s a question that may haunt the health-care system for years to come.","JUNE 11, 2021"
Newly Insured Americans Don’t Understand Basic Healthcare Terms - The Atlantic,5834,"An estimated 14 percent of English-speaking adults in the United States have below-basic literacy, or an inability to perform simple reading tasks. But 35 percent have only basic or below-basic health literacy. That means more than 77 million people have difficulty with common health-related reading tasks. Health literacy involves the ability to obtain, process, and understand the health information necessary to make appropriate decisions, and it’s clearly essential to selecting health insurance. More Americans are enrolling in federal and state-based marketplaces, but being insured is only the beginning when it comes to reducing health disparities related to literacy. Low health literacy disproportionately affects vulnerable populations that include individuals now eligible for new health insurance options: those with lower socioeconomic status and education, or disabilities; non-white racial and ethnic groups; the elderly. Many of these Americans are now contending with unfamiliar insurance terms and are at risk of making uninformed choices that they may regret. This matters because those with low health literacy already tend to experience poorer health and to generate increased costs, estimated by some to amount to more than $100 billion annually. While I am not an expert on the Affordable Care Act, as a clinical psychologist who conducts research on patient-centered care and health literacy, I am concerned about how millions will find their way through the maze of information without the basic understanding they need to make good choices. On the HealthCare.gov website, some of the communication tools used are commonly recommended by those of us working in the field of health literacy. There are videos on how to use the Marketplace and other videos portraying personal stories about selecting health insurance. Some have gotten hundreds of thousands of views so far. Perhaps most important for those whose low literacy precludes effectively navigating a website, or for those whose primary language is something other than English or Spanish, there is the 24/7 telephone helpline as well as lists of local organizations that can provide personal assistance with applications (there are more than 500 in my area). And recently a tip sheet was released to help those with new insurance. But will all this be enough?    In my clinical role at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, I provide psychological services to patients who have cancer—a population that faces large healthcare costs and is concerned about insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions. With enrollment deadlines looming, our center gave a presentation for patients wondering how the ACA would affect them. But some patients with limited health literacy need much more assistance. Our coordinator of supportive oncology education has spent up to five hours helping just one patient apply for insurance through the Marketplace. She has needed to explain basics like premiums and deductibles, as well as how to compare insurance options. She has walked patients through checking to make sure their current doctors will be covered under new plans. Notably, despite having proficient health literacy and training, the coordinator has herself sought assistance to confirm the finer details. Clearly, these are not easy tasks. These experiences echo the findings of a recent study from the Urban Institute indicating that a majority of those most likely to use the Marketplace are not confident in how well they understand even rudimentary health insurance terms. How much the U.S. government spends on healthcare gets a lot of attention. But our below-average literacy among developed countries is more of a dirty, not-so-little secret. Three literacy-relevant policy initiatives released in 2010 were eclipsed by the signing of the ACA into law that year. President Obama signed the Plain Writing Act, requiring that communication to the public by federal agencies be understandable. Healthy People 2020 included increasing health literacy among its national objectives and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius launched the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy. Since then, health literacy information and tools have been made increasingly accessible to health professionals, various health insurance plans have developed health literacy initiatives, and expert roundtables have been held to identify how best to advance health literacy within healthcare reform. Thanks to increasing research and policy over the last decade, we have amassed a respectable set of health literacy tools and guidelines that are at the disposal of key players in our nation’s overhaul of its healthcare system. Still, there is a long road from these foundational steps to meaningful implementation. Certainly there is room to improve individuals’ health literacy skills via adult education and K-12 curricula. However, we also need immediate solutions for the newly insured and others presently struggling within healthcare systems.   To start, the reading level of written materials—from insurance and pharmacy forms to hospital discharge documents—should be tested and often reduced. Patient navigators show promise in addressing additional health literacy barriers experienced by those most at risk of not attaining appropriate care. Further, educating healthcare providers and patients on effective communication is beneficial across literacy levels. Most important is holding health insurance and healthcare organizations accountable for establishing, evaluating and reporting health literacy practices. Good health literacy is achieved when people’s abilities and preferences are well-matched with the demands and resources of the systems they are navigating. Failing to prioritize it will cost us dearly.","JANUARY 22, 2014"
The 5 Percent: The Super-Users and Health-Care Spending - The Atlantic,20074,"An oversized poster of the Seinfeld character Kramer watches over Phil Rizzuto’s daily routine. When Rizzuto, named for the famous New York Yankees shortstop, swallows his 6 a.m. pills, Kramer is looming over him, looking quizzical. Same for the 9 a.m., noon, 6 p.m., and midnight doses, each fistful of pills placed in a carefully labeled Dixie cup. “I live on medication,” he says. Rizzuto’s daily life in Haverhill, Massachusetts, is a litany of challenges: His aides have to hoist his paralyzed legs from his bed to his motorized wheelchair and back again; keep the bag that collects his urine clean; tend to the gaping wound on his backside, which developed when he was left to lie still in bed too long; and help him avoid the panic that could claim anyone in his situation—that last one is particularly difficult since Rizzuto’s obsessive-compulsive disorder drives him to want to do everything for himself. After more than a year of emergency and rehabilitative care following a devastating car accident, Rizzuto moved into a YMCA-run housing complex in this gritty New England town. But he still endured constant medical emergencies. “I was back and forth and in and out of the hospitals so much, it was like I didn’t know I had an apartment here,” the 56-year-old says, sitting in his small studio. His open wound kept getting infected; his diaphragm, weakened by his injury and his inability to quit smoking, left him gasping for breath; his urine-collection bag slipped out; his demons kept getting the better of him. The government eventually covered the cost of his care, but the relentless need for medical attention was exhausting and demeaning. Then he opted into a Massachusetts health-care program called One Care that focuses on people with complex medical needs who are on Medicare. One Care provides 71 hours of aide support a week, a twice-weekly visit from a massage therapist, twice-monthly psychiatric care, a wheelchair support group, and a nurse practitioner who oversees and coordinates Rizzuto’s care. If he struggles between visits—or just wants to talk—she’s available by phone, even on weekends and after hours. Now, his life has a routine and a discipline that keeps emergencies at bay. “The difference it’s made …” he says, unable to fully express his gratitude. He estimates his hospital visits have dropped at least 75 percent since the One Care program took charge of his health. “I would hate like hell to not have them.” The program that has helped Rizzuto is part of a nationwide movement to improve care for people struggling with very complicated medical needs—so-called super-users—the 5 percent of patients who account for about half of the country’s health-care spending. (Surgeon and New Yorker writer Atul Gawande outlined the problem and one solution in a definitive 2011 piece about the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers.) Some of these super-user programs say they provide cost savings of as much as 20 to 40 percent after a few years, as well as provide the kind of advantages offered to Rizzuto: fewer stressful hospital visits, better mental and physical health, and the satisfaction of being treated like a person instead of a package of problems. The program accomplishes this by shifting the focus of medical care. Instead of responding to complications, the care team tries to prevent them. “You can’t even get to the medical issue until you’ve figured out: Do they have a place to sleep, do they have housing they’re not going to lose, do they have food in their refrigerator, do they have a refrigerator?” says Christopher Palmieri, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Commonwealth Care Alliance, which manages 80 percent of One Care patients, including Rizzuto. Despite its successes, this care movement, which doesn’t go by any catchy name—one doctor gave it the clunky title “high-impact, relationship-based primary care”—is scattered among a handful of states and is advancing only very slowly across the country. There is general agreement that these programs must address a range of social and pragmatic needs, like transportation, housing, nutrition, isolation, emotional well-being, and medical problems. But the details of each program are different. “Everyone’s trying their home brew,” says Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and health-care researcher at Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital. The one thing all of the super-user care programs have in common is a mantra that could have come from Cosmo Kramer himself: Stay the hell out of the hospital. Hospitals, these folks argue, often make sick people sicker. They’re sources of infection to vulnerable patients. They’re disorienting. They run costly tests and look for issues that are better left alone. Super-users, says Krumholz, “represent a failure of the system.” Medical care is dangerous,” says Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, the co-founder and CEO of Iora Health, a leading practitioner of a more holistic approach to health. Fernandopulle says a big part of his company’s business model involves fighting to keep people out of the hospital—not just because it’s expensive, but because the care they will get puts them at higher risk for other problems. Medicare patients saw roughly a 40 percent drop in hospitalizations after Iora took over their care, Fernandopulle says. For Fernandopulle, one patient in particular illustrates this phenomenon of snowballing medical care. That patient was an 80-year-old woman, fairly healthy but with hypertension and arthritis, who one day saw red in the toilet after urinating. She told her primary-care doctor, who sent her to a urologist; the urologist worried it might be cancer and ordered a catheter inserted. Before the procedure, a nurse asked the octogenarian if she ever felt weak or dizzy. (Of course she did—think about it.) When the woman said yes, a heart monitor was ordered: It showed a dip in her overnight heart rate. A cardiologist then scheduled the woman for a pacemaker. “This is what I mean by the vortex,” Fernandopulle says, noting that inserting a pacemaker would be risky and provide no clear benefit. The woman’s condition might be explained in a much more low-tech way: a beet salad, for example, could be the culprit behind the red pee, and a prescribed medication might trigger the heart irregularity. “I called the cardiologist and politely declined the pacemaker for this patient,” Fernandopulle says. Part of the problem is that, while each doctor gets paid for each procedure he or she performs, usually no one gets paid for taking a step back and using common sense to think about what would genuinely help the patient. “The health-care system as a whole is out of balance,” says Dr. Donald Berwick, the former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama. “We put far more into hospital care than we do keeping people from having to be in the hospital.” Hospital stays cost more than anything else in the health-care system; an average inpatient admission runs nearly $2,000 a day, and an intensive-care stay can easily cost $7,000 a day. In 2012, a typical hospital stay topped $10,000, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Caring for an Iora patient, on the other hand, typically costs about $3 a day and can reduce hospitalizations by 40 to 50 percent, Fernandopulle says. All of the physicians and advocates we interviewed who support this type of high-needs care are quick to note that their goal isn’t to deprive people of medical care. If someone doesn’t get needed heart surgery, they will end up in worse shape; no one will benefit. Their aim is appropriate, Goldilocks care: not too much, not too little. The model hinges on establishing strong, trusting relationships—but that doesn’t always come easily. “Some patients jump on board; sometimes it takes six months to establish a connection,” Tremblay says, recalling one patient who refused to talk to her for nearly five months before finally accepting help. She has become profoundly invested in her patients’ care. “Every time we send someone to the hospital, it’s stressful,” for both the patients and caregivers, Tremblay says. “We send someone in [and] we kind of shudder, Are they going to come out better?” One big challenge to providing care for patients with complex needs is finding them. Commonwealth Care, for instance, has struggled to identify people who will benefit from its program. Any Massachusetts resident who receives both Medicare and Medicaid is eligible to join One Care. Commonwealth Care Alliance, which serves most of these patients, had to hire extra staff to track down potential clients. When Commonwealth Care started four years ago, 43 percent of these potential clients were considered “unreachable,” for reasons like having an unknown address. Today, that rate has shrunk to 32 percent. Why is it so hard to track down needy patients? Some people are so isolated and disengaged that they’re largely invisible. Others patients are expensive and challenging today but might soon recover. And still others are doing fine now but might have a setback that throws them off balance for months. In fact, 60 to 80 percent of patients who are super-users now won’t be a year from now, Sevin says, and different people will be. There are also people who will be perennially expensive—because their disease requires a costly drug, for instance. And there are those who will be expensive for a short time—say, for the few months after an organ transplant. There’s no point in wasting time trying to bring either group’s medical expenses down. Fernandopulle says the only effective way to identify people at risk for super use is to ask them two questions: “How do you think your health is?” and “How confident are you in managing your health?” “If they answer, ‘Poor, poor,’ they are at huge risk,” he says. On a recent sweltering day, Rizzuto met his wheelchair support group at a small zoo in suburban Boston. Keeping cool in the above-90-degree heat wasn’t easy for Rizzuto. Paralysis robs people of their ability to regulate body temperature. One of Rizzuto’s aides, Bill Regan, came prepared with water, ice packs, sandwiches, and a spray bottle that he frequently spritzed on Rizzuto’s face and legs. Rizzuto says these interactions with other people in wheelchairs help lift his mood, though on this trip he seemed more focused on watching a brown bear, several snakes, and tiny, hyperactive cotton-topped tamarins. He never could have made it around the zoo without a motorized wheelchair—though it took Rizzuto a year to convince the state to buy it for him. One of the first things Commonwealth Care Alliance does when signing on a new One Care client is to assess the person’s equipment needs, Tremblay says. One Care is a partnership between Massachusetts’s Medicaid agency and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and it focuses solely on patients ages 21 to 64 with multiple, complex medical and behavioral issues. (An older program, Senior Care Options, takes the same approach for patients over 65.) Most of Commonwealth Care’s 13,500 One Care clients earn less than $20,000 a year; some are homeless; the majority of them have a serious mental illness or substance-use disorder, as well as multiple other chronic health conditions. This high-touch care approach is beginning to save money, says Palmieri. A report last year by the Commonwealth Fund found that among 4,500 members of One Care, patients enrolled for 12 continuous months had 7.5 percent fewer hospital admissions and 6.4 percent fewer emergency-room visits. For those enrolled in the program for at least 18 months, hospital admissions dropped 20 percent, the study found. Although each model of high-touch care is different, the basics are the same: focusing on prevention, ensuring basic needs are met, reducing unnecessary treatment, and building relationships with patients. At Stanford University, for example, one young man with severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder required constant reassurance (in addition to his multiple medications) from doctors and emergency departments. In a traditional care system, emergency-room staff might roll their eyes and quickly send him on his way. Instead, Dr. Alan Glaseroff, the co-founder of Stanford’s Coordinated Care program to treat high-needs university employees and their family members, gave the 19-year-old his phone number. At first, whenever his anxiety or OCD took control, the young man called Glaseroff or another care coordinator as many as seven times a day. But slowly, over the course of three years, the man learned to think before he called. If he saw spots in his eyes, he’d wait for a few minutes to see if they went away. He was taught to use mindfulness techniques, and if the symptom persisted, he would run through a checklist to see if it was really something to be concerned about. He ended up calling the clinic every two to three weeks, rather than multiple times a day, and learned not to lean on the clinic’s staff for minor issues. “Now, he hardly needs us,” Glaseroff says. Creating viable long-term plans like this means far fewer emergencies. In fact, in its first three years, the Stanford program cut emergency-room visits for its 253 patients by 59 percent, hospital admissions by 29 percent, and total cost per patient by 13 percent, says Glaseroff, who teaches this model of care in two-day workshops across the country. According to the study, the Stanford practice saved the university $1.8 million and now has nearly twice as many patients. The secret to the cost-savings, Glaseroff says, is for patients to use hospitals and doctors only when absolutely necessary and to rely for most of their care on empathetic—and relatively inexpensive—medical assistants, who check in with each patient about once a week. In the past four years, in an industry known for its high burnout and turnover, not one of his practice’s care coordinators has left, Glaseroff says. “They’re not allowed to diagnose and treat, but they’re really good at the people stuff,” he says. “The core is being given responsibility for people, not for tasks.” Patients in the program have responsibilities as well as rights, Glaseroff says. They are expected to show up for their medical appointments and to come on time out of fairness to others. They’re told to call the clinic if they can before heading to the emergency room and then wait a few minutes for a call back, Glaseroff says. They are expected to do their part to engage with their care coordinator, even if the medical system hasn’t always treated them well in the past. “It’s patient self-management—what people do within their chronic illness 365 days a year—that matters the most,” he says. For the high-touch model to work financially, large numbers of patients have to stick around long enough to recoup the upfront investment in their care. Today, there are only a few pools of people stable enough to sustain this model: people who work for major employers, like Stanford University, and those insured by the federal government. Iora provides health care to workers at large, stable employers like the Dartmouth College Employees, the New England Carpenters Benefits Fund, a union trust, and members of Medicare Advantage plans, like Humana and Tufts Health Plan. This gives them a big group of customers with high needs and the corporate muscle to avoid being pushed around by hospitals that don’t want to lose patients, Fernandopulle says. If he loses customers to other insurance carriers in the first year or two, he’ll have all the upfront costs and none of the savings. A five-year time horizon allows Iora to recoup its upfront investment and get ahead of problems—controlling diabetes before it leads to a heart attack, for instance, says Fernandopulle, whose company oversees care for about 20,000 patients in eight states. Iora and another company with a similar approach, Landmark Health, also provide care to people on Medicare Advantage—a government-funded, privately run program. About a third of people on Medicare now belong to Medicare Advantage programs, which were created by the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration and Republicans have proposed huge cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. It’s unclear, however, whether such cuts would paralyze efforts at innovation or provide more urgency to reduce health-care spending. “It is a bipartisan issue that the current costs of health care are unsustainable,” Yale’s Krumholz says, “whether driven by empathy for those who are disadvantaged and suffering or by economic imperative.” But there are also built-in disincentives to this kind of high-touch care. One of the most obvious is that hospitals make money on patients. If they succeed in decreasing readmissions, they also limit their own earnings. Despite efforts to replace fee-for-service care with so-called global payments, “the fact is that currently most health-care systems are still operating in an environment where reducing emergency-department and inpatient use hurts their bottom line,” says Dr. Seth Berkowitz, a primary-care doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies how addressing patients’ social needs improves their health and lowers costs. Moreover, the model is challenging to scale, because all health care is local. State laws, hospital structures, and needs differ from place to place. What works in Florida doesn’t work in Washington state, and vice versa, notes Fernandopulle, whose frequent-flyer miles attest to his attempts to learn about new markets. Slowly, though, these scattershot efforts may be coalescing into a larger movement. Fernandopulle says it’s getting easier for companies like his to raise money in the private sector. Other factors seem to be coming together, too. Technology allows health-care companies to more easily identify people at risk of becoming super-users, track their progress, and standardize some of their treatments. There’s broad public consensus, gaining momentum in recent years, that health-care costs need to come down, says Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, the executive officer of the National Academy of Medicine, an advisory body formerly known as the Institute of Medicine. “Now the issue is not whether; it’s how.” Rizzuto is lucky that he was treated for his 2012 car accident in Massachusetts. If he’d had to recover in neighboring New Hampshire, where someone else’s road rage landed him in a ditch and then in a month-long coma, he’d probably still be making near-weekly trips to the emergency room. The crash left his spine broken in two places and exacerbated his post-traumatic-stress disorder and a concussion that still makes him feel like “I have some scramblage with my brain.” The paralysis has left him with limited control of the outer three fingers on each hand—restricting his ability to play his beloved guitar—and he can’t breathe deeply enough or with enough control to sing anymore. His core muscles are weak, too, Rizzuto says, explaining why his torso wobbles uncontrollably as he speaks. “I’m so close to being a quadriplegic, it’s crazy,” he says. Rizzuto lifts his t-shirt to reveal small, circular burn marks dotting his chest. He knows he needs to quit smoking—and will have to before his upcoming surgery to close the wound on his back, but it has been a struggle. Rizzuto says he often spaces out with a cigarette between his fingers and doesn’t notice he’s doing himself damage until it’s too late. “There’s just so much to get used to,” he says. But he has also come to terms with his current life. Despite everything that has happened, he still has his adult twin sons, a daughter, a granddaughter, a safe place to live, and caregivers who really care. And so he goes on living the best life he can. He even hopes to start talking to high-school kids about his experiences. “I’m very fortunate,” Rizzuto says. “I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I’m supposed to do something with this stupid accident that happened to me.”","JUNE 29, 2017"
Extreme Health Care - The Atlantic,2109,"Kevin Drum is skeptical that America does more in extremis than other healthcare programs: If only Kevin had a subscription to The Atlantic--very reasonably priced at 19.95 a year--he would have found a hint in Virginia Postrel's article about Herceptin and early stage breast cancer, which we ran in March.  That article is about New Zealand, but the controversy over Herceptin was not limited to the Southern Hemisphere; Britain had a famous case involving the expensive cancer drug, in which a woman successfully used a combination of legal and media pressure to force the NIH to provide her with the drug for her early-stage breast cancer (she has since died).  Early stage HER2 positive breast cancer is hardly a 0.001% event--25% of breast cancers have the HER2 trait, and those tend to be the more aggressive kinds of cancer.  The drug had already been offered for early stage cancers in the US for years, even though no one had definitive proof that it worked. This may be why--contrary to what Mr. Drum has apparently read--cancer survival rates in Europe lag those in the US.  (Although this is complicated:  we catch cancer earlier, because we're screening-test-mad, and some cancers just hang out for decades without killing you).  At the highest macro level, life expectancy, Europe generally outperforms us.  But it's not clear how much of that is health care, and how much things like our murder rate, and our famously sedentary lifestyles.  When you drill down into many diseases, we outperform them.  And many argue that we outperform them on hard-to-measure ""lifestyle"" issues:  how fast your torn ACL gets repaired, how quickly (or whether) you get a hip replacement, etc.  Such quality of life issues are nearly impossible to measure, though this hasn't stopped many people from trying.  But I don't really trust the figures they generate. Europe gets a great deal out of all of this.  We figure out what works, then they adopt it.  But we get a great deal too--we get earlier access to controversial treatments, and our future generations get all the treatments we've discovered so far..

Evaluating Healthcare in America - The Atlantic,8279,"Parsing a comprehensive new report from the Commonwealth Fund, which finds that the healthcare system in the U.S. is, in general, declining, receiving the lowest score it ever has According to a comprehensive new report by the Commonwealth Fund, the healthcare system in the U.S. is, in general, declining. This year, the U.S. received a score of 64 out of a possible 100. In 2006, the U.S. got a 67 out of a possible 100, and in 2008 it earned a 65. The report, entitled ""Why Not the Best? Results from the National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2011,"" covers key health indicators from the years 2008-2009, and is the third installment of the series that began in 2006. The researchers, gathered from various hospitals and research institutions across the country, considered 42 key measures of healthcare in five different areas reflecting financial, medical, and human considerations: COST AND CARE, TWO RELATED PROBLEMS The main message of the report is that healthcare costs are rising but they are simply not matched by improvements in the care people receive. In other words, breaking it down to the most fundamental issues, there are two problems: Cost and care. The total cost of healthcare -- which includes everything from primary care and preventative medicine to the treatment of chronic diseases to hospitalization and long-term care -- is rising faster than we can keep up, according to the report. The U.S. spends twice per capita what other countries spend. The authors of the report comment that ""U.S. health system performance continues to fall far short of what is attainable, especially given the enormity of public and private resources devoted nationally to health."" The cost of healthcare is rising faster than the average American income, which leaves many people without access to insurance and health care at all. Beyond the issue of cost, the quality of the care in the U.S. seems to be suffering. Measures like infant mortality and the number of unnecessary re-hospitalizations indicate that the U.S. still has a long road ahead. That said, there were some bright spots, signs that we may be on the right track, at least in some ways. For example, the U.S. is gaining ground in the management of certain chronic diseases and in the quality of long-term care, both of which are important markers for healthcare quality. The authors argue that the Affordable Care Act will -- and has already begun to in some ways -- change the state of the heathcare system in the U.S. How far-reaching its effects will be remains to be seen. WHERE THE U.S. SUCCEEDS The U.S.'s overall score of 64 reflects a variety of strengths and weaknesses. The areas of improvement were not insignificant. In general, the U.S. showed promise in the control of chronic conditions, smoking rates, the use of electronic files for record keeping, and in certain aspects of hospital and long-term care. Breaking it down, we find the following trends. THE AREAS IN DECLINE Despite progress in the areas above, there are three areas that show no improvement or have actually declined in recent years: healthcare, insurance accessibility, and cost of care. The issues, of course, are not completely separate from one another. Falling Short on Measures of Overall Health The U.S. scored 53 out of a possible 100, about the same as in previous reports, in a measure known as efficiency -- how well the healthcare system functions overall. Efficiency is a broad area, encompassing the ""level of inappropriate, wasteful, or fragmented care; avoidable hospitalizations; variation in quality and costs; administrative costs; and use of information technology."" Here are some of the factors contributing to this score: Insurance: Poor Access and Affordability Unsurprisingly, the Commonwealth Fund report found that In 2010, 44 percent of adults (81 million people) were either uninsured or underinsured, which means that ""they were insured all year but had medical bills or deductibles that were high relative to their incomes."" This represents a one-third increase from 2003. The high cost of health insurance is the main reason for this. In 2003, the percentage of adults spending less than 15 percent of their household income on health insurance was 57 percent. In 2009, the number spending 15 percent dropped to four percent. At the same time, the number of people in medical debt rose to 40 percent in 2010, up from 34 percent five years earlier. U.S. Surpasses Other Countries in Cost of Care As the numbers above suggest, the final area where we differ considerably from other nations is in the amount of money we spend on healthcare in the country. According to the report, the U.S. spends twice as much per capita than other countries. And the rate at which our spending is increasing is steeper than in other countries. In fact, we are close to spending one out of every five dollars of income on healthcare. As the authors say, given all the shortcomings in the healthcare system, ""[w]e should expect a better return on this investment."" WHAT IS AT STAKE IF WE DON'T CHANGE? The report's conclusions are not big news, but the depth of detail in the picture it paints makes it a major contribution to the healthcare debate. The report concludes that there are risks -- both ""human and economic"" -- if we don't make changes to the system sooner than later. The authors of the report predict that healthcare costs will increase further, more and more people will be uninsured, and the quality of care will continue to suffer. The three areas chase each other in a vicious cycle. Pushing it further, we could argue that as a result of a worsening situation, chronic disease would also continue to rise, mortality would increase, and our quality of life would decline. Taking the First Steps But there is a silver lining: The situation has started to improve. In the same way that shortcomings in the system perpetuate one another, improving just one area of health care can set in motion a positive chain of events, with multiple areas showing improvement as the result of a single change. The report's authors argue that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has already facilitated access to care, which is an important step. For example, adults up to 26 years of age can now be insured under their parents' policies. This has allowed an additional one million people health coverage. When the Act is in full effect the authors calculate the country's average insurance coverage rate should match the level of the best-insured states. Yet to be accomplished, but hand in hand with access to care, improving primary care is the second critical step. Better primary care could theoretically affect everything from the management of chronic conditions to the prevention of unnecessary re-hospitalizations to the avoidance of emergency room visits. Beginning with these changes (which are admittedly not small ones) we should start moving things in the right direction. The Changes We Should Expect If the United States were able to meet the same benchmarks for healthcare as other developed countries, the authors project we would see: These projections are both inspiring and daunting. Clearly, a massive change in a massive country won't happen over night. Other nations have stronger health care systems in part because they are smaller and have been utilizing other methods for years or decades. It's clear that the American public is ready for change, and we are slowly making steps in that direction. Things have already started to improve, if slowly. Time will tell how the Affordable Care Act will continue to improve the situation, and over what time frame. It may need to be amended considerably as its effects become visible over the coming years, or additional measures may be necessary. But as the authors of the new report point out: ""Although the task of moving to a system that is truly high performing is enormous, the stakes are even higher if we fail.""

Struck by Turtle: Anticipating a New Healthcare-Billing System - The Atlantic,6203,"T minus 12 months and counting until physicians and hospitals must comply with the federal government's October 1, 2014 deadline to implement the ICD-10 system for classifying diseases. Developed by the World Health Organization, its predecessor ICD-9 has been in place since the late 1970s. It lists no fewer than 13,000 billable codes, which include such exotic diagnoses as ""injury from fall while occupying spacecraft"" and ""exposure to fireball effects of nuclear weapon."" The U.S. clinical modification of ICD-10 will include no fewer than 68,000 codes. These changes are emblematic of a plague of complexification sweeping across healthcare. The deadline for implementing ICD-10 has been pushed back multiple times, mainly due to the time required to design and install software and hire and train coding specialists to cope with the new system. Most physicians I know are baffled by it. For example, ICD-10 distinguishes between ""spacecraft collision injuring occupant,"" ""spacecraft fire injuring occupant,"" ""spacecraft explosion injuring occupant,"" ""forced landing of spacecraft injuring occupant"" ""unspecified spacecraft accident injuring occupant,"" and ""other spacecraft accident injuring occupant."" But this isn't all. It also distinguishes between such turtle-related injuries as ""bitten by turtle"" and ""struck by turtle,"" and between ""bitten by turtle - initial encounter"" and ""bitten by turtle - subsequent encounter,"" as well as ""struck by turtle - initial encounter"" and ""struck by turtle - subsequent encounter."" Under just what circumstances someone would be struck by a turtle in a subsequent encounter is left to the imagination of the coder. Similar byzantine coding subcategories apply to assaults by alligators, dogs, and even ducks. Imagine typical community physicians, who might be a solo or small-group practice. How could they hope to cope with such complexity? Would they be able to master it on their own? Or would they need to retain the services of a small battalion of coders, billers, and information technology support staff to have any hope of putting such a system into practice? And what is the effect of such complexity on the efficiency, ease of use, level of integration, quality of communication, and overall cost of our healthcare system? Who could blame patients and physicians for thinking that the provision of high-quality medical care is already more than sufficiently complex without adding additional burdensome layers of administration? Just look at any contemporary textbook of internal medicine. The best known runs to over 4,000 printed pages. It is chock full of information about human disease and its treatment. Then along comes a disease classification system that runs to 68,000 entries. It is not difficult to imagine many physicians hanging their heads in despair, overwhelmed by a sense of futility. Many innovations in healthcare that originally seemed like important steps forward have turned out merely to add complexity without offering any real benefit to either patients or physicians. For example, bolting on new information technology and increasing the complexity of medical information systems has frequently accomplished little more than turning the physician into a data entry specialist. Even worse, the goal of such initiatives is frequently not to enhance care but to facilitate billing. The attractive red ribbon in which such gifts originally came wrapped has often turned out to be a mummifying ball of red tape that makes it difficult to unwrap the present that is supposed to be safely encased inside. Said one of my colleagues recently, ""I went to medical school to care for patients, not to fill out forms."" Put another way, healthcare is becoming more bureaucratic, and the rate of bureaucratization seems to be increasing exponentially. More and more, bureaucrats, not physicians, are shaping how medicine is practiced by assuming control of how healthcare is classified and paid for. The word bureaucracy after all, comes from the French word bureau, meaning desk, and a bureaucrat is someone who sits behind a desk, devising rules and making sure they are followed. Bureaucrats both public and private frequently have little or no experience of actually caring for patients. What seems obvious from the standpoint of someone with a background in insurance or healthcare administration frequently does not make sense from the perspective of patients and health professionals. John Stuart Mill famously wrote that bureaucracy stifles the mind, and this is exactly what is happening in healthcare. The personal dimension of the patient-physician relationship is being taken out of the equation and replaced by a series of bureaucratic guidelines and rules. Every complaint, every diagnosis, and every treatment must have its own code. Rules, not the judgment and discretion of human beings, increasingly predominate. Patients and physicians who thought they were acquiring a new and better range of healthcare options are discovering that such systems frequently turn out to function like huge boa constrictors, squeezing the life out of the collaboration and trust that characterize a thriving patient-physician relationship. For healthcare to thrive in the future, physicians need to see themselves not as nameless and faceless functionaries, but as personally responsible for the quality of work they do and the relationships they build. What can ordinary people do about the growing complexity of healthcare? When confronted with such looming changes as ICD-10, we can seek answers to some basic questions and then vote accordingly with our ballots and wallets: Why do physicians spend as little as eight minutes per day in the company of each hospitalized patient, yet spend more than 40 minutes per day interacting with health plans? Why does the U.S. spend at least $360 billion annually on healthcare administration, more than three times what we spend each year on treating cancer? And above all, why is my doctor so distracted, distraught, and discouraged, and what can each of us do to help all doctors devote more of their attention to what really matters most in healthcare - taking good care of patients?","SEPTEMBER 30, 2013"
"Three Ways to Improve U.S. Healthcare, as Demonstrated in India - The Atlantic",6334,"Listening to caregivers from other countries, it's easy to feel exasperated about U.S healthcare. American hospitals are filled with good people trying to do good work, but at every turn the system of misplaced incentives gets in the way of good patient care. Indeed, the most pressing problem with American healthcare is that it is too wasteful. Writing in the Harvard Business Review and the Washington Post, two U.S. business professors, Vijay Govindarajan from Dartmouth and Ravi Ramammurti from Northeastern University tell the story of how Indian hospitals deliver better care for much less. The two professors uncovered nine private hospitals in India that provide quality care at a fraction of U.S. prices. For example, cardiac surgery there costs $3,200, which is 5 to 10 percent of the cost in the United States. Outcomes are comparable and the hospitals make a profit. ""Narayana Health, for instance, reports that the 30-day post-surgery mortality rate for coronary artery bypass procedures at its Bangalore hospital is below the average rate recorded by a sample of 143 hospitals in Texas,"" they write. More striking than the ends, though, were the means. Three major innovations lie at the heart of the Indian hospitals' success. Major hub hospitals reside in the cities, while spoke hospitals service the surrounding areas. “This strategy concentrates the best equipment and expertise within the hub, with telecommunication links that allow hub specialists to serve spoke patients remotely. Since these specialists perform a high number of specific procedures, they quickly develop skills that improve quality,” they write. The best results in medicine come when we allow practitioners (and their teams) to specialize in their craft. This is not what happens in the United States. Here, competing hospitals dilute the talent. I’m an electrophysiologist, so let’s use two heart rhythm procedures, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation and pacemaker/defibrillator lead extraction, as examples. These are good examples because it takes hundreds of cases and years of experience to master these “feel”-dependent procedures. Experienced operators who are concentrated in a few major centers should be the only doctors doing these procedures. In most American cities, though, these two procedures are divvied up among many hospitals and many operators. However, the literature is replete with studies that correlate outcomes with operator training and experience. The notion that building big beautiful hospitals in the suburbs for convenience—and then thinking they are good places for care—is insulting. What’s wrong with saying: I’m sorry you are facing lead extraction, but for this, you need to go to Hospital X, and it’s downtown. Sorry. It’s inconvenient and the parking stinks. But it’s best for your health. At the moment, American health practitioners aren't courageous enough to say this. The authors also point out that in India, lower-level staffers perform a much wider array of medical tasks: “The transfer of responsibility for routine tasks to lower-skilled workers leaves doctors free to focus on complicated medical procedures. Several hospitals have created a tier of paramedic workers with two years of training after high school to perform routine medical jobs. As a result, surgeons, for example, are able to perform two to three times as many surgeries as their U.S. counterparts. Compare that with the United States, where hospitals reduce costs by laying off support staff and shifting mundane tasks such as billing and transcription to doctors, who are overqualified for those duties.” Consider my experience: After performing nearly 10,000 catheter ablations and cardiac devices over 15 years, I've gotten really good at these procedures. In my city of one million people, Louisville, Kentucky, there are only a handful of other doctors who do these procedures well. In an Indian system, we would be protected. We would be asked to do high-level heart procedures and little else. Yet that’s not the case in the U.S. system. I can only do these skill-dependent procedures two and a half days a week. That’s because I have other duties, like managing routine blood tests, seeing routine follow-ups, and entering clerical data on each patient. In fact, due to the burden of tasks, I've had to reduce the number of patients I see by nearly 50 percent over the past decade. In the U.S., to even think about task shifting is seen as weak—or pompous. You are too good to do grunt work? Indian hospitals don’t have the luxury of worrying about such perceptions. Scarcity forces efficiency. Another impediment to task-shifting in the U.S. is the false belief that lesser-trained caregivers, like nurse practitioners or physicians assistants, are not adequate. This is ludicrous. In my field, there is ample evidence that nurse-directed care can even be better than doctor-directed care. Why wouldn't it be? If all you do each day is listen to and care for patients in just a couple of disease states, you become skilled, regardless of the letters that follow your name. The New York Times recently published a piece that challenged readers to choose which images depicted luxury hotels and which were hospitals. Readers couldn't tell. They looked the same. You don’t have to go to India to see frugality in hospitals. I visited a private hospital in Germany. The place was quiet, clean, and remarkably simple. They re-sterilized equipment that in the U.S. gets thrown away after one use, and they performed procedures with equipment that had been proven useful through evidence, not marketing. They taught me to work without the use of an expensive (but unproven) ultrasound catheter. I've done some 300 cases since then without that catheter, and, at $2,000 per case, that’s a lot of savings. The injustice, though, was that saving the system money (by doing the procedure more efficiently) cost my hospital and me income. Efficiency, in this case, was financially penalized. The wastefulness of U.S. healthcare is complicated. The fee-for-service model, in which hospitals and doctors make more when they do more, contributes to the problem. The unbundling of cost and price is also a huge factor. These are big policy problems, but ignoring them keeps us behind other countries in how we deliver care.","DECEMBER 10, 2013"
Can the Innovator Class Save Healthcare?,6169,"TEDMED brought a relentless optimism about healthcare reform to a city of tired ideas. More is needed, however, to make a difference in Washington, DC. Facebook/TEDMED WASHINGTON, DC - Perched on the banks of the Potomac River, the TEDMED gathering weighed in last week on what it considered the greatest challenges facing healthcare. A meeting closely associated with the high tech-optimism of Silicon Valley and other outposts of America's innovator class, TEDMED came east this year from it's previous home in San Diego. The idea was to bring the gathering's ethos and its troupe of entrepreneurs, thinkers, futurists, doers, and artists to our nation's political capital. It's unclear whether Washington was listening during the three and half-day day assembly, since much of the establishment here was away on Easter-Passover break. But National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins gave a talk. And so did Commissioner of the Food & Drug Administration Margaret Hamburg, along with a few other Washington types, even if they mostly didn't stay and mix in the usual TED fashion. Still, the 1700 attendees did engage in an activity that Washington understands - an election. The delegates - many of whom paid $5,000 to be there - voted for one of 50 ""Great Challenges"" facing healthcare that they believed was most worthy of attention. They were joined by thousands of non-attendees following the meeting for free on simulcasts and on the organization's website. Sponsored by the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the TEDMED organization, the challenges included The Obesity Crisis, Eliminating Medical Errors, End-of-Life Care, Impact of Poverty on Health, and Medical Information Overload. Click here for the full slate of candidates. The list included some perennial Washington obsessions such as Addressing Health Care Costs, but did not include other DC favorites such as the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid and the future of Obamacare. The soft-pedaling of politically touchy issues was in line with the wishes of the new curator of TEDMED, Jay Walker, who decided that the meeting would avoid contentious content during its first outing in DC. An inventor and the founder most famously of Priceline, Walker's company, Walker Digital, acquired TEDMED last year. Not everyone in the TEDMED community agreed, given that this is a political town and issues can be discussed without taking sides. Personally, I believe that a TED meets Washington airing of issues could be exciting. Walker, however, wanted to stay with the tradition of TED, which stands for Technology Entertainment & Design - but not politics. Each of the 50 challenges at TEDMED were represented by an ""advocate"" - entrepreneurs, physicians, hospital executives, patient representatives, and others. At the last minute, probably late at night, a challenge #51 was added to the list - Sleep Deprivation - hardly a shock at a meeting of over-achievers. Some of the advocates campaigned hard for their challenge, donning buttons and t-shirts and passing out cards and flyers. For instance, one morning on a bus taking me to the meeting place at Kennedy Center, a personable young physician named Rajiv Kumar thrust out his hand and a card encouraging me to vote for his challenge - Inventing Wellness Programs that Work. ""70 percent of Americans don't exercise regularly,"" he explained, telling me he had co-founded a company in 2006 called ShapeUp. Based in Rhode Island, Kumar's business company is using data and the latest Health 2.0 tools to help other companies incentivize their employees to be more fit, to improve health and to save money. In another nod to Washington, a few advocates enlisted the deeper pockets of well-healed sponsors such as the Cleveland Clinic. Their Chief Experience Officer, physician James Merlino, campaigned for Improving Medical Communication. His flyer quoted George Bernard Shaw: ""The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."" And now, the envelope please. The winner was: Inventing Wellness Programs that Work - Rajiv Kumar's challenge. This candidate brought in a staggering 10% of the vote, twice the percentage of the second place winner, which was The Caregiver Crisis, polling at 5%. Third place was a tie, with Role of the Patient polling the same as The Obesity Crisis, each getting 4% of the vote. Fourth place was a seven-way tie at 3% each, which included Improving Medical Communication - the campaign assisted by the Cleveland Clinic. The top 20 winners will become the focus of projects over the next year. Some challenges that didn't make the top-20 cut were Isolation and Loneliness, Special Needs Patients, Unwed Teen Motherhood, Reducing School Violence, and Malpractice Dilemma. If there is a take-away from this election, it's that this self-selected group of forward-looking people believes that healthcare reform should focus much more on keeping people healthy and engaged in their own healthcare. This is not surprising among these highly motivated self-starters, who include an outsized number of people who are vegetarians, yoga practitioners and techies. Yet I wonder if a greater challenge is how to translate this sensibility to the non-TEDMED-minded, such as those 70% of Americans that Rajiv Kumar said barely exercise or the 535 members of the House and Senate working up the hill from Foggy Bottom, where the meeting was held. I'd also encourage a stronger push by Jay Walker and the TEDMED community to truly engage with Washington and the powers that be. This would mean converting the talk about innovation - combined with the powerful confidence of a culture that fervently believes they can fix things, and sometimes succeeds - to a real process of re-energizing health reform. Washington certainly could use an entrepreneurial reset of fresh ideas from beyond the Potomac and its slow-moving waters. Perhaps this is the intent of Walker and company - to tiptoe into town this year to establish a presence, and then next year to pounce.

Health Care Just Became the U.S.'s Largest Employer - The Atlantic,5806,"This moment was inevitable. It just wasn’t supposed to happen so soon. Due to the inexorable aging of the country—and equally unstoppable growth in medical spending—it was long obvious that health-care jobs would slowly take up more and more of the economy. But in the last quarter, for the first time in history, health care has surpassed manufacturing and retail, the most significant job engines of the 20th century, to become the largest source of jobs in the U.S. In 2000, there were 7 million more workers in manufacturing than in health care. At the beginning of the Great Recession, there were 2.4 million more workers in retail than health care. In 2017, health care surpassed both. There are several drivers of the health-care jobs boom. The first is something so obvious that it might actually be underrated, since it is rarely a proper news story in its own right: Americans, as a group, are getting older. By 2025, one-quarter of the workforce will be older than 55. That share will have doubled in just 30 years. The graying of the nation will have widespread economic and political implications, like declining productivity and electoral showdowns between a young, diverse workforce and an older, whiter retirement bloc. But the most obvious effect of an aging country is that it needs more care—and that means more workers. Second, health care is publicly subsidized, in several ways. Most directly, the U.S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year on Medicare, Medicaid, and health-care benefits for government employees and veterans. More subtly, the U.S. subsidizes private insurance in several ways, including through a tax break for employers that sponsor health care. This public support makes health-care employment practically invincible, even during the worst downturns. Incredibly, health-care employment increased every month during the Great Recession. Third, the two most destabilizing forces for labor in the last generation have been globalization and automation. Together, they have hurt manufacturing and retail by offshoring factories, replacing human arms with robotic limbs, and dooming fusty department stores. But health care is substantially resistant to both. While globalization has revolutionized supply chains and created a global market for manufacturing labor, most health care is local. A Connecticut dentist isn’t selling her services to Portugal, and a physician’s receptionist in Lisbon isn’t directing her patient to Stamford. Health-care work has, so far, been generally resistant to automation, too. While artificial intelligence may one day take over radiology, while programmable robots replace brain surgeons, that future isn’t quite here yet. Recently, the growth in health-care employment is stemming more from administrative jobs than physician jobs. The number of non-doctor workers in the health industry has exploded in the last two decades. The majority of these jobs aren’t clinical roles, like registered nurses. They are mostly administrative and management jobs, including receptionists and office clerks. It’s not always clear that these workers improve health outcomes for patients. “Despite all this additional labor, the most meaningful difference in quality over the past 10 years is the recent reduction in 30-day hospital readmissions from an average of 19 percent to 17.8 percent,” wrote Robert Kocher, a senior fellow at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. This isn’t the end of health care’s run. It’s just the beginning. Of the 10 jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects will see the fastest percent growth in the next decade, five are in health care and elderly assistance. The two fastest-growing occupations—personal-care aides (who perform non-medical duties for older Americans, such as bathing) and home-health aides, (who help the elderly with medical care)—are projected to account for one in every 10 new jobs in that time. The entire health-care sector is projected to account for a third of all new employment. While this is an important moment to take stock of the rise of the care economy, labor categories like “retail” and “health care” are imperfect approximations. For example, as online shopping grows, fulfillment centers and delivery truck drivers become integral parts of the retail industry. But the government does not categorize many of these jobs as retail. But while some categories are too restrictive, perhaps others are too broad. For example, there are technically more jobs in “leisure and hospitality” than in health care. A supersector that includes restaurants, hotels, and amusement parks, leisure and hospitality has grown faster than the overall labor market every year since the turn of the century, mostly thanks to the growth in restaurant workers. But it doesn’t really make sense to think of a Michelin star chef, a hotel manager, and a ticket counter at Disney World working in the same industry. The work that seemed to define the 20th century in the American imagination included union jobs held by white men who made things. But manufacturing employment peaked in the late 1970s. Forty years later, the fastest-growing occupations—like personal care and home-health aides—are quite the opposite: poorly paid, lacking a strong union, often female, and disproportionately filled by immigrants (who account for one-third of the in-home health care workforce). The fastest growing job with higher-than-average pay in the U.S. is registered nurse. But male nurses are stigmatized. Even married women say they’d prefer their husbands find another profession. But an increase in male nurses is just the sort of development that is demographically inevitable in any health-care nation. Services are the new steel.","JANUARY 10, 2018"
Health Care in the Time of Grey's Anatomy - The Atlantic,10688,"It is hard to overemphasize how much I loved Grey’s Anatomy in high school. I loved it superstitiously. Due to a weird set of coincidences, I truly believed that if Grey’s Anatomy wasn’t new that week, I would have a bad week. At the time, it aired on Sunday nights, and I took it as an omen. I would show up to school Monday morning filled with dread after a rerun. I don’t blame Shonda Rhimes for my misfortunes anymore. But hours (or, more accurately, probably days) of watching Grey's, Scrubs, and other medical TV shows has still shaped my life, if research is any indication. Several studies have shown that people who watch a lot of medical shows are more likely to believe certain things about doctors, and about healthcare. Admittedly, these medical shows provide a skewed image of the healthcare system at best. Surely no hospital has had as many romantic pairings as the doctors on Grey’s (whose 11th season starts next month), and I have to imagine bedpan racing in the workplace is … frowned upon. Though you might think that people are perfectly capable of separating television from reality, cultivation theory suggests they cannot, entirely. The theory goes that the social reality people are exposed to on TV shapes their attitudes toward real social reality, and it does so, of course, in subtle and complicated ways that are hard to nail down. Prevailing societal attitudes obviously influence what goes on TV, too, further complicating the relationship. “Television, movies, books, all of these things, a lot of people like to believe they’re just fun and games, that they really don’t affect us, it’s just entertainment,” says Dr. Rebecca M. Chory, a professor in Frostburg State University’s business school who has studied TV’s influence on attitudes toward healthcare. “But the research consistently shows that’s not true.” A 2005 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the majority of primetime TV viewers reported learning something new about a disease or other health issue over six months of viewing. About one-third of viewers took some kind of action after learning about a health issue on TV. Many medical shows have physicians consult for accuracy, and an article in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics notes that starting with ER in the ’90s, TV shows began using more detailed medical jargon to describe conditions and procedures. But there are still inconsistencies. Treatments for patients with seizures are sometimes downright dangerous, with doctors trying to hold patients down, or put things in their mouths (they could choke). Patients tend to survive cardiac arrest more often on television than they do in real life, making CPR seem more effective than it often is. “That can lead to a misunderstanding as to the likelihood of a patient or loved one surviving a cardiac arrest,” says Dr. David Brown, chair of the department of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. “But it isn’t really good TV if everybody dies, right?” What does make for good TV: Rare diseases. Injuries. Natural disasters. Which means the amount of screen time given to different conditions isn’t proportional to how common those diseases are in real life, according to a new study published in Human Communication Research. People flock to these shows, after all, first and foremost to be entertained. So less sensational, more quotidian conditions like diabetes are underrepresented. As a result, “a fan of medical dramas … can develop a skewed perception of what are more or less prevalent health issues in the real world,” study author Dr. Jae Eun Chung, an assistant professor in the school of communication at Howard University, told me in an email. Heavy viewers of medical dramas in her study were less likely to rate cardiovascular disease and cancer as important societal issues (when they are, in fact, the top two causes of death in the U.S.), and when it came to cancer, they were more fatalistic, “more likely to say that cancer prevention is uncertain and that the disease is fatal.” On TV, the patients that have these compelling rare diseases are played by a revolving door of guest stars. The characters we really get to know are the doctors themselves. And the way doctors have been portrayed on television has changed markedly over the years. Medical shows in the ’50s and ’60s, like City Hospital, Dr. Kildare, and Ben Casey, showed doctors as noble, infallible heroes. These shows apparently received “creative input and guidance from the American Medical Association,” according to an article in Annals of Emergency Medicine. Starting in the ’70s and ’80s with shows like M*A*S*H and St. Elsewhere, the pendulum swung toward portraying doctors as the flawed humans they are. We’ve been firmly in the era of flaws for a while now with shows like Grey’s and House, MD (whose rude, drug-abusing titular character gets by on his brilliance). This perhaps explains why, in a 2003 study (on which Chory was an author), watching more prime-time medical shows was associated with “perceiving doctors as more uncaring, cold, unfriendly, nervous, tense, and anxious.” “The fact that people aren’t perfect—on the one hand, that’s great for drama, but then what does that do for what people think of real life physicians?” Chory asks. Could human portrayals help the doctor-patient relationship, by getting people to relate to their physicians? Or does the knowledge that doctors can also make mistakes weaken trust? “I’m not sure that these TV shows really enhance empathy toward the doctor,” says Dr. Alexandra Chabrerie, a primary care physician on faculty at Harvard University. “I think doctors are still sort of expected to know everything, especially when you have [characters] like House.” But in real life, she notes, a diagnosis doesn’t fall on one doctor’s shoulders. “It takes a whole team of doctors to come together and solve problems,” she says. “For cancer, you have tumor boards and tumor conferences that talk about what the optimal approach is.” Studies of modern medical shows have found fictional doctors’ professionalism disappointing at best. In an analysis of 50 episodes of Grey’s Anatomy and House, researchers found that the characters handled issues involving patient consent well 43 percent of the time. “The remainder [of the depictions] were inadequate,” the study says. The analysis also found several incidents of doctors endangering patients without being punished, sexual misconduct (of course), and disrespect. The study notes that “88 percent of disrespectful incidents in House involved Dr. House.” But despite all the inappropriate romances, and Dr. House’s rude mouth, the analysis found that there’s one arena in which TV doctors still shine: caring for patients. “Caring and compassion when dealing with patients is particularly noteworthy, because it is the only virtue of professionalism we identified in which the exemplary portrayals outnumber the lapses,” the researchers write. A lot of the out-of-control unprofessionalism in these shows does seem to be in service of the patients. On one episode of Grey’s Anatomy, two female interns confront their boss in the men’s bathroom, to convince him to do a risky operation. On the goofy Zach Braff comedy Scrubs, doctors treat patients who have no insurance, and bill the procedures to the insurance of patients who recently died. Fictional doctors do often go the extra mile for their patients. (There is actually an episode of Scrubs called “My Extra Mile.”) These portrayals may be why watching Grey’s Anatomy was linked to seeing doctors as more courageous, in another study. And seeing doctors as more courageous was subsequently linked to better patient satisfaction. All the heightened drama and medical inaccuracies aside, Chabrerie says it’s the emotional challenges of being a doctor that these shows tend to get right. “I do think the emotional aspects get brought up more in shows like Scrubs,” she says. (She’s not the only one—a 2009 Slate article says that despite the show’s “cartoonishness,” it’s “quite in tune with the real lives of doctors.”) “In med school, this is what we did. We lay in our beds and watched Scrubs,” Chabrerie says. “At the end of the day, we see [the same things] all the time. We lose patients all the time. It’s never easy. [On these shows], the young doctor gets really upset, and the older, wiser doctor comes in and says ‘You have to let it go.’” As it enters its 11th season, Grey’s Anatomy is the biggest medical show still on air. Others, like Hart of Dixie and The Mindy Project, have taken the “doctors’ personal lives” strategy that Grey’s made popular and run with it, all but abandoning the depiction of any actual medical treatment. But a decade of Grey’s dominance, combined with the longevity of other 21st-century medical shows (House got eight years, Scrubs got nine, ER, 15) surely takes a toll. When a television show becomes a huge part of popular culture, it can influence even those who don’t watch it. “Even if you’re not watching the program, it creates kind of a cultural public opinion, a dialogue about the topic,” Chory says. “You hear things from people who do watch it. There’s a long line of research saying that one way media affects us is through our personal contacts.” Ultimately, though, Chory says that the biggest influence comes from what you watch, rather than what’s on. And shows that aren’t on-air anymore can sometimes find new life on Netflix. “The influence of repetitive watching of those medical shows, to me, is rather subtle,” Chung says. “We may not realize that our perception and attitude changes as a result of repetitive exposure to medical dramas because often the influence happens at the unconscious level.” Though the hospital remains a compelling setting for fictional drama, we’re past the heyday of doctor-show dominance. Their influence surely lingers, but for those who can’t get enough rare diseases, there’s always the Internet. “For my 40th birthday, my husband got me a framed sign that says ‘Please don’t Google,’” Chabrerie says. “My patients get so freaked out.” She adds that those who fall into WebMD holes are probably some of the same people who binge-watch House or Grey’s Anatomy. Here are some things that are true. Anytime I have the mildest bodily discomfort, I become fully convinced I am dying. I’m also extremely reluctant to go to the doctor, a combination of qualities that makes being my friend a constant delight, I’m sure. I work on the Internet. And I love medical TV shows. Are these things related? I don’t know. I’m trying not to blame Shonda here, but, you know, old habits.","AUGUST 26, 2014"
Massive Open Online Healthcare - The Atlantic,8164,"Hark, a new age dawns in healthcare! No longer must we tolerate long waiting times for a doctor appointment or service in the hospital emergency room. No more will we suffer inequities in access to healthcare. Relentlessly climbing healthcare costs will become a thing of the past. Herald instead a brave new world, in which cutting-edge information technology will solve once and for all the core problems that have plagued US healthcare for decades. Just as the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) has revolutionized education at all levels, so the MOOH (Massive Open Online Healthcare) is about to revolutionize the nation's healthcare system, putting out of work most of the businesspeople, politicians, and pundits who have for so long profited from its afflictions. At last, we stand on the threshold of not just ""the next big thing"" in medicine, but the final and biggest thing of all. The MOOC was born in 2008, when prophets of the new information technology finally realized that the real purpose of pedagogical accessories such as teachers and classrooms is educational content delivery. The MOOH is emerging just five years later, as healthcare leaders finally realize that the real purpose of physicians and hospitals is merely to deliver medical content. To achieve massive increases in efficiency, we simply need to get rid of most teachers and physicians. Consider the following analogy. In the old days, people contracted infectious diseases such as measles or smallpox, which often left their victims permanently scarred or even dead. Then onto the scene burst vaccination, from the Latin for cow, because the first vaccination was derived from cowpox. Suddenly, people no longer contracted such diseases. The MOOH does the same thing -- transforming medical care from a highly labor-intensive, expensive process into an efficient type of inoculation. Like the MOOC, MOOH follows on the heels of a number of other technological revolutions, including radio, motion pictures, closed-circuit TV, and video conferencing. It solves the problem of healthcare access by making it available to anyone with an Internet connection. It solves the finance problem by making it available almost for free -- an hour of a physician's time can be beamed out to thousands, even millions of patients. And it can be delivered anytime, at the patient's convenience. In other words, the MOOH dramatically increases the efficiency and reduces the costs of the healthcare industry by largely removing its greatest source of inefficiency and cost -- human beings. Once physicians have recorded their consultations, they cease to be needed. After all, how many times each day do physicians around the country say the same things? ""What seems to be the problem?"" ""Take one of these every six hours for ten days."" ""You really should drop a few pounds."" Direct costs go down, because we need far fewer physicians, nurses, and hospitals. Indirect costs, such as time off from work and the costs of transit to and from healthcare facilities, also decrease dramatically. This will permit a huge reallocation of the nation's labor pool, from maintaining and repairing the workers to actually making more things. Someday people will look back in wonder and amazement at all the time and effort we once frittered away tending the sick and injured. Experience with MOOCs suggests another potential cost advantage of MOOH. Many MOOCs enroll huge groups of students, numbering into the tens and even hundreds of thousands. However, the percentage of students who actually stick with the course throughout the semester and complete all the assignments is often in the low single digits. If this patterns recurs, the number of patients the healthcare system needs to deal with long term could be dramatically reduced, causing costs to plunge. Just as there were once never enough chairs in the classrooms of schools and universities, so there were never enough seats in physicians' offices and hospital emergency rooms. Now, however, we can do away with the seats entirely. And patient choice is dramatically expanded -- we can choose which physician we want to hear, tune out what does not please us, and absorb information at our own pace, even replaying over and over parts that we do not get the first time. The advantages for healthcare administrators will be huge. First, they need no longer waste time cajoling and threatening their recalcitrant medical staffs, a task often likened to herding cats. In addition, they will be able to exert more direct control over healthcare, removing intermediaries such as physicians and nurses, who often fail to get with the program. Finally, it will make it possible to slow down the often bewildering pace of change in healthcare, giving leaders valuable time to adapt. What we are talking about here is the replacement of medieval models of medical care, which rely on quaint and frankly obsolete notions such as the patient-physician relationship, with an evidence-based, data-driven, information-rich, and leaner approach to healthcare. Plus it will be crowd-sourced, enabling participants to take full advantage of peer-to-peer education and evaluation. In effect, it can turn the waiting room into a treatment room, fully capitalizing on the wisdom of the crowd. Once medicine was physician-centered. Now medicine will be truly patient-centered, with us the patients in control of where we receive care, how the care is delivered, who delivers it, and what care we receive. Patient dissatisfaction with physicians and hospitals will become a thing of the past, since there will be virtually no physicians and hospital to be dissatisfied with. The triumph of MOOH seems all but inevitable, like a tsunami of technology rolling across the nation's healthcare landscape. Of course, the change in our healthcare business model will be profound and irreversible, spawning unexpected benefits. For example, as costs plunge toward zero, healthcare providers will no longer need or even be able to compete on costs. No longer treated as commodities, they will compete strictly on the basis of quality, and the excellence of U.S. healthcare will necessary rise at an ever-quickening pace. Only the very best will be able to survive. Inevitably, some problems will arise. For one thing, a small number of backward patients will still want to see and be seen by their physicians in person, just as a few Luddite students still insist on attending classes with live professors. Some accommodation will need to be made, at least temporarily. On the bright side, however, the fact that such patients will be receiving care in an outmoded and discredited model should hasten their demise and speed the universal proliferation of MOOH. A second problem concerns procedures that cannot be delivered digitally. For example, some patients will still need broken bones set and inflamed appendixes surgically removed. When such circumstances arise, however, procedure centers operating on a self-service basis will be available, much like a quick oil change. Patients will simply schedule the procedure on line, present at the appointed time, and then undergo the procedure with a minimum of wasteful human interaction. Finally, there is the problem of time and effort. While physicians and other health professionals will be relieved of a great deal of work, the burden will shift to a large extent to patients. Like the MOOC student, MOOH patients must devote time and effort to healthcare, into whose pilot seat we will now be thrust. Happily, however, this should not be much of a problem, since it will be our own life and health on (the) line, which should provide more than adequate incentive. In sum, we stand at the precipice of healthcare's promised land. The New York Times declared 2012 the ""Year of the MOOC."" The time has come for the nation's patients and physicians to declare 2013 the ""Year of the MOOH."" To facilitate the unification that will be necessary, it would be helpful to have some symbol to rally around. To capitalize fully on the bovine analogy, may I suggest as the logo for robust MOOH the image of a strapping golden calf?","JULY 11, 2013"
The State-Level Future of Healthcare Reform - The Atlantic,17994,"The Supreme Court’s ruling in King v. Burwell, whatever it may be, won’t mark the end of Obamacare. On the other hand, Obamacare itself was never intended to be the last word on the country’s healthcare needs. At the state level—where, unlike Congress, elected officials actually have to govern—Republicans are already proposing and even enacting their own approaches to healthcare reform.  The likely result is a national consensus, at some point in the future, on a plan that both parties could have agreed upon a long time in the past. The current health-insurance debate is stuck in a larger national dispute over whether the government or the private sector has all the answers. But neither the left’s persistent hope for a single-payer system, nor the right’s all-encompassing belief in the blessings of unfettered markets, represents a likely political outcome—let alone a reasonable policy solution. The most likely compromise has been known for some time, but as the two parties have grown farther apart on everything, especially healthcare, this outcome has been lost.  Now, it is slowly re-emerging, piecemeal and unnoticed. Even during the original debate over the Affordable Care Act, proponents admitted that experience would necessarily yield improvements in a complex, comprehensive, and controversial experiment. The fundamental problems in our healthcare system—which have little to do with whether government or the private sector pays for health insurance, on which the debate has largely centered since then—are multiple and interrelated, meaning that any solution will be complicated and require a lot of time and adjustment. And, of course, it will require government involvement. The American healthcare system is more expensive and yet delivers inferior care, relative to those of other developed nations. A higher percentage of Americans go without coverage for their healthcare needs than in any other advanced economy; for those who do have private coverage, the costs of care remain a heavy, and growing, burden. These problems tend to reinforce each other. For instance, the cost of care for those lacking coverage get absorbed by those who have it. An emphasis on expensive, technologically-advanced treatments for catastrophic illnesses raises costs across the board, driving many away from obtaining less-critical care that could keep more people healthy. And due to an historical anomaly—to avoid World War II wage-and-price controls, employers began offering health benefits instead of raises—most Americans receive their healthcare through insurance heavily subsidized by someone else, and not really resembling “insurance” in the traditional sense at all. These policies cover normal, quotidian care needs, rather than simply providing security against expensive “black swan” events. Health plans today look more like prepaid usage plans for cell phones. As conservatives have long argued, third-party payment structures—not just government programs but also private insurance—lead to overconsumption and price inflation. Make people feel the price of the care they consume and, pretty soon, needless procedures and ever-escalating inflation will decline. Any long-term solution will involve shifting from the current “insurance” model and instead paying providers for keeping people healthy. Both Obamacare and Republican alternatives move in that direction. But a better, cheaper system still won’t automatically be affordable to all. That can be remedied through income-based subsidies, however, rather than government-provided healthcare. This basic prescription—income-related government subsidies in a competitive insurance market structured around health promotion—is similar in pertinent respects to the healthcare plan advanced by Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley in the 2000 campaign and praised by the libertarian Cato Institute. It likewise resembles the right-wing Heritage Foundation proposal from 1989, famous for devising the “individual mandate” idea central to Obamacare and now rejected by Republicans.* Republican states are now adopting this model with the Obama administration’s support, although with some features (subsidy caps and high deductibles) that disadvantage people more the poorer they are. In the long term, then, convergence is likely sometime in the future—with comparatively minor quibbles over details—on a plan that both parties could have agreed upon a long time in the past. The Affordable Care Act created federal tax subsidies to help moderate-income families buy insurance policies on government-run “exchanges” designed to make insurers compete for their business. At issue in King v. Burwell is whether these subsidies are available in states that chose not to establish their own exchanges but, rather, let the federal government establish one instead, by default. This matters because, without the subsidies, many families won’t be able to afford to comply with the requirement to buy insurance (the infamous “mandate”), and the exchange system at Obamacare’s heart will—it is alleged—collapse. If the Supreme Court so decides, however, that won’t really end Obamacare. Rather, it would essentially end Obamacare in red states. But it would survive in blue states. That’s essentially what the Court gave us in 2012 when it took it upon itself to rewrite and save the statute by declaring that states had the constitutional right to opt-out of expanding Medicaid—the government-run insurance program for the poor—to cover the near-poor with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, the Medicaid expansion—along with the exchanges designed to help those above that threshold afford private coverage—went ahead in Democratic states. States under Republican control, for the most part, turned the deal down. The nation thus began a striking experiment in federalism, in which, basically, liberal states will get the more-or-less liberal idea of healthcare reform and conservative states will get to stick with less government and the pre-Obama healthcare system everyone loved so much. Somewhere down the road, we’ll get to see who’s happier. States that rejected Obamacare also chose not to set up their own exchanges, so, under the law, the federal government set up exchanges for them. If the Obamacare challengers win in King v. Burwell, nothing will change in blue states—but red states, which already rejected coverage for the near-poor, can say sayonara as well to middle-class subsidies. This has struck fear into the hearts of not just the law’s supporters, but also, belatedly, those of many Republicans. The reason is simple: Many middleclass families (and thus likely voters) will see their insurance costs skyrocket, heading into an election year, for reasons wholly attributable to conservative opposition to Obamacare. As a result, Republican leaders in Congress have been scrambling in recent weeks to make clear that they won’t leave these voters (and their insurance companies) without some form of subsidy. While the easy fix would simply be to clarify in statute that the subsidy language is intended to apply to federal as well as state exchanges, that would be too, well, Obama. So congressional Republicans have proposed several variants that, essentially, provide some similar form of subsidy, but not too much, and not for too long (basically, just until they can get past the 2016 elections). The story is more complex at the state level. Some believe that exchanges collapsing in two-thirds of the states will cause the system to implode everywhere. But this is unlikely given that insurance rates are set on a state-by-basis, even on federally-run exchanges. A “death spiral” in one state—in which healthier consumers opt-out of high-priced coverage, leaving only sicker ones who push the cost even higher—shouldn’t affect the viability of the market in other states. Perhaps even more importantly, many of the states in question are already planning to institute their own state-run exchanges, if the Court requires them to do so in order to preserve subsidies for their citizens. That underscores the fact that opposition to Obamacare is at least as much about objecting to Obama as objecting on any real policy basis. In fact, only half of the 35 states under partial or full GOP control rejected all participation in Obamacare. All 15 states under complete Democratic control adopted Obamacare in full. That leaves 18 “red” states in which there was some gubernatorially-led attempt to sign on to most or all of the federal program, and in 15 of these it either was successful or (in two cases) is still pending before the legislature. Of the 13 Republican-controlled states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion, just over half—seven of them—did so without demanding any changes whatsoever in the federal program (although New Hampshire’s Republican legislature has since changed its mind and requested some alterations). In sum, Republican states are only slightly more likely at this point to reject Obamacare entirely than to accept it in some form, and, more tellingly, of those that have decided to take the federal money, just under half even bother to insist upon changes to make it more “conservative.” Where a conservative alternative has been formulated, the proposed changes from standard Obamacare—while clearly more consistent with long-standing Republican philosophy—have been fairly mild. First, there have been a certain number of predictable attempts to shave benefits and impose work requirements. The major focus of benefit restrictions, however, has been non-emergency medical transportation, which, as a major cost item for many states, smacks more of budget concerns than any general desire to slash benefits. Another, more severe limitation sought by some states is to delay the start-date for benefits until the state gets around to approving an individual’s application; under federal law, Medicaid benefits must be provided with “reasonable promptness” to eligible beneficiaries, and coverage can extend back retroactively to three months before when the beneficiary actually applied. Conservatives also tend to insist that public benefits should come with a work requirement. Beyond that, the requested Republican modifications to Medicaid expansion have centered on ideas that many Democrats would find acceptable and—in some cases—have even proposed themselves. These fall into three basic categories: Partial financial responsibility for public beneficiaries is hardly a new concept: There is a widespread belief, not confined to conservatives, that people both better appreciate and are less demeaned by benefits to which they contribute in at least some small part. Thus, even the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enacted by a Democratic Congress under President Bill Clinton required small monthly premium payments. The idea that beneficiaries should bear some utilization cost is particularly strong in healthcare, where “co-pays” are common in both public and private plans to encourage some assessment by the consumer as to whether the (usually expensive) service is really needed. The focus of contention in the future will revolve, as always, around exactly what cost and benefit levels are appropriate; for instance, some GOP states have sought to impose rather large financial penalties on emergency room use retroactively deemed unnecessary, while others have sought to impose small monthly premiums even on recipients below the poverty line, which federal law currently prohibits. But this is more an argument over details than first principles. Incentives for healthy behavior are hardly controversial any longer, either—although they were as recently as five years ago, when new federal regulations stopped then-Governor (now Senator) Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a Democrat, from including them in his state’s Medicaid program. In fact, incentivizing consumers to pursue healthy lifestyles and intelligent healthcare choices is an element of all current approaches to lowering costs and improving care for all Americans—including Obamacare. To date, all such proposals—including the four Medicaid expansion waivers (in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania) so far approved by the Obama Administration—have involved positive incentives (such as waived copays or premiums) for those who pursue desired activities, as opposed to penalties for those who don’t. Any ultimate solution probably involves paying providers for keeping people healthy—what’s now called “Pay for Performance.” But health promotion is a long-term pursuit. Building it into the healthcare system will require coverage plans that take a long-term interest in the customer: Private companies might do a good job of this—but the government is likely to do better. Employer-based health insurance, especially in a world of increased job mobility, is unlikely to foster the required continuity—some other, broader and more permanent, basis of coverage (again, say, government) is probably needed. Consumers at least should be free to choose between public and private options. That brings us to what may be the primary issue to Republicans in reforming healthcare: “premium assistance,” or using public funds not to offer Medicaid benefits to the expansion population but rather to subsidize purchase of private insurance. In what was dubbed the “private option,” Arkansas became the first state to go this route in a compromise between the Obama Administration and Arkansas’ GOP legislature brokered by former Democratic Governor Mike Beebe. Iowa, Indiana, and New Hampshire have since followed suit, while Republican governors in Tennessee and Utah—and a Democrat in Montana—have attempted unsuccessfully to persuade their GOP-controlled legislatures to do so. As with all such issues, there are policy details that cut both ways. For instance, both Arkansas and Iowa want to test whether enrolling expansion beneficiaries in the same coverage available to moderate-income families on the exchanges will reduce the number of families needing to go back-and-forth between one form of coverage or the other as their income, and thus eligibility status, fluctuates. That would seem to make good sense. On the other hand, subsidizing private insurance poses countervailing risks of dropped coverage because of limited enrollment periods or changes in employment status – and, of course, it presents the problem inherent in all voucher-type programs, that the government subsidy is inadequate to make purchase of the private plan affordable, especially where the choice of private plans is limited to what’s on offer from a particular employer. But the key issue facing Republicans interested in premium assistance is ideological: the role of government in the nation’s future. Even those generally suspicious of the ability of government to provide services available in the private marketplace might acknowledge the exceptional nature of healthcare. A single payer system, it is argued, would reduce costs of duplication, bureaucratic overhead, and excessive profits in the private insurance market, while the gains in risk-spreading amongst the widest possible insurance pool would more than offset the loss of price competition. Realistically, however, government displacement of the entire private insurance market is unlikely to occur anytime soon in this country. Nor, would I argue, should it: Government needs competition just as much as the private sector. The best arrangement, in my view, would be a private market “policed” through a competitive public alternative. With or without such a public option, the nation’s healthcare future clearly lies with private insurance. The main question is the extent to which government will subsidize its purchase to make it affordable for more Americans. In King v. Burwell, conservatives are now—somewhat to their own chagrin—fighting such subsidies for moderate-income families, simply to spite Obamacare. They would do better to go in the opposite direction and push to expand the subsidy system—rather than government-provided insurance—for poorer families, as well. In fact, a little over a decade ago this appeared to be the bipartisan future. It still could be. Why not move all Medicaid recipients—existing and expanded—into private health plans? Government’s role then would be simply to provide a means-tested subsidy for private coverage. I was asked last year to figure out how one GOP governor could obtain the budgetary advantages of expanding Medicaid coverage at federal expense while reducing, rather than expanding, the numbers on a government-provided product (and without having to admit to accepting federal funding); I was interested in helping square this circle because the result would be health insurance for tens of thousands of additional near-poor people. The obvious answer was to convert Medicaid completely to government-subsidized but privately-provided coverage—something Republicans advocated more than a decade ago, until centrist Democrats like Bill Bradley started to embrace the idea, too. Such an approach would then—as the Arkansas and Iowa experiments suggest—also integrate easily with Obamacare’s middle-class subsidies, creating a single, simple, universal but privately-based system of healthcare for all. Of course, this would require liberals to accept that the goal of government in this area ought to be to ensure affordable coverage—not necessarily to provide it.  And it would require conservatives to admit that government has a role to play that must, at a minimum, involve stepping in to ensure that Americans have a right not to die, or otherwise suffer serious threats to their health, just because the private market doesn’t provide for their needs. Now, that would be a healthy compromise. * This article originally attributed the idea of an individual mandate to the Cato Institute. We regret the error.","APRIL 10, 2015"
Expensive Healthcare Doesn’t Help Americans Live Longer - The Atlantic,3275,"We already know American healthcare is pricey, much more so than that of other industrialized countries. But a new analysis published this week in the American Journal of Public Health points out that all that spending doesn’t translate to longer lives for Americans. The results are particularly atrocious for women: Among the 27 industrialized nations studied, the United States ranks 25th when it comes to reducing women's deaths by spending more on healthcare. The authors used data from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries collected between 1991 and 2007, and they performed a regression analysis while controlling for behavior and economic factors. The result: Every additional $100 the U.S. spends on healthcare per person translated into a gain of less than half a month of life expectancy. In Germany, the best-performing nation, every additional $100 spent resulted in an additional four months of life. In most of the countries, health spending boosted the life expectancy of men more so than that of women, and this was true in the U.S., as well. Jody Heymann, dean of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and one of the study’s authors, attributes this partly to the fact that women are more frequently misdiagnosed for certain conditions, and to the problem that, prior to a 1993 NIH mandate that women be included in clinical studies, most medical research was historically performed on male subjects. But overall, the main reason the U.S. lags in longevity is that we spend far less on preventive measures than other countries do, Heymann said. Three-quarters of our healthcare spending goes toward treating chronic problems like diabetes and hypertension, and 45 percent of Americans have a chronic health condition. “Diabetes expenditures, for example, have tripled in a generation,” she told me. “That has to do with how expensive it is to treat diabetes, but that also has to do with the dramatic increase in the number of people who have diabetes. We are doing little to make sure people have opportunities for physical activity, a decent diet—the things that would help with their risk of developing cancer and diabetes.” “Prevention,” to Heymann, doesn’t just mean physicals and screenings. She points out that access to fresh food and “active” transportation, such as bike lanes, are sorely lacking in many parts of the country. In 2009, Time analyzed why the southern U.S. contains some of the most obese states in the nation and found that not only is there little public transportation in the South, it’s too hot to exercise outside for much of the year, there’s a dearth of sidewalks, and high poverty levels mean people tend to eat less-healthy food. The better-performing nations in Heymann’s study have worked to reduce poverty, since being poor can worsen health outcomes. They also promote physical activity more aggressively, and they weave more prevention counseling, such as nutritionist appointments, into their medical systems. There are obvious things the U.S. could be doing better, she says. “When you put soda machines in high schools, it's bad for kids' health. Or when you subsidize corn syrup so that eating high-fructose foods is inexpensive,” she said. “There's a lot that could be done.”","DECEMBER 13, 2013"
The Civil Rights Movement Led the Fight for Universal Health Care  - The Atlantic,15961,"It was a cold March night when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. turned his pulpit towards health care. Speaking to a packed, mixed-race crowd of physicians and health-care workers in Chicago, King gave one of his most influential late-career speeches, blasting the American Medical Association and other organizations for a “conspiracy of inaction” in the maintenance of a medical apartheid that persisted even then in 1966. There, King spoke words that have since become a maxim: “Of all the inequalities that exist, the injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhuman.” In the moment, it reflected the work that King and that organization, the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR), were doing to advance one of the since-forgotten pillars of the civil-rights movement: the idea that health care is a right. To those heroes of the civil-rights movement, it was clear that the demons of inequality that have always haunted America could not be vanquished without the establishment and protection of that right. Fifty-one years later, those demons have not yet been defeated. King’s quotation has become a rallying cry among defenders of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark 2010 legislation that has come the closest America has ever been to establishing a universal guarantee of health care. Their position is in peril, as the Republican effort to repeal the law and create a replacement that leaves 22 million more people uninsured over the next decade and will slash Medicaid enrollment by 15 million now sits just days away from possible passage. People of color were the most likely groups to gain coverage and access to care under the ACA, and in the centuries-old struggle over health, they have never been closer both to racial equality of, access and to, the federal protection of health care as a civil right. But if Republicans have their way, that dream will be deferred. Just as the ACA’s defenders find themselves between a once-in-a-generation victory and a potential equally devastating loss, so the MCHR found themselves in 1966. King delivered his address just months after breakthroughs a century in the making. In the height of the movement in the early 60s that brought sweeping changes in voting rights, integration, and education, civil-rights actors had also won major victories in a push for universal health care. Chief among those victories were two of the defining pieces of 20th-century American policy: the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Of course, the Civil Rights Act might not seem like much of a health-care bill, and Medicare isn’t usually counted among major civil-rights victories, but as detailed in in health-policy researcher David Barton Smith’s The Power to Heal: Civil Rights, Medicare and the Struggle to Transform America’s Health System, they were complementary pieces of a grand civil-rights strategy. Key to that strategy was the 1963 Simkins v. Cone lawsuit, filed by dentist and Greensboro, North Carolina, NAACP leader George Simkins against segregation in the local hospital. In finding in Simkins’s favor, the The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the first time that institutions receiving federal funds could not abide by the “separate but equal” legal underpinning of Jim Crow. That ruling in turn helped shape Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars segregation and discrimination among entities that receive federal funding, and to this day provides the most effective legal mechanism for federal civil-rights cases. The NAACP and the National Medical Association—the black professional organization that was formed because the the AMA was segregated—led by W. Montague Cobb fought for the passage of the first major American health reform policy in Medicare and Medicaid. They organized direct action, legal challenges, and lobbying efforts in support of the reform, in direct opposition to most of the rest of the segregated medical establishment.  “Medicare was in a very real sense a creation of the civil-rights movement,” Smith says. In the ensuing hearings, Cobb was the only leader of any medical association to testify in favor of Medicare and Medicaid. In 1965, just a week before also passing the Voting Rights Act, Congress passed the amendment to the Social Security Act that authorized Medicare and Medicaid, with Cobb as the witness to Lyndon B. Johnson’s signing ceremony. The law’s effects on segregation were felt immediately. Since Medicare’s universal coverage of elderly people brought federal funds to about every hospital in America, it also bound them by Title VI’s nondiscrimination clauses, which essentially ended segregation in those hospitals—some of the last public arenas in which Jim Crow legally held sway. Medicare was the final federal legal blow for de jure segregation, and without it, there would still be few legal mechanisms to force hospitals to integrate. It’s hard to overstate how much Medicare and Medicaid themselves did to end formal segregation. By the same token, it’s hard to overstate just how deeply that waning segregation had mattered in health outcomes. From the end of slavery onward, American health-care has been deeply bifurcated along the lines of race, and that bifurcation was always reflected in how well people lived and how early and often they died. Jim Downs’s Sick From Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering During the Civil War and Reconstruction explores how that bifurcation began, chronicling the role of the Reconstruction-era Freedmen’s Bureau in fighting severe epidemics among formerly enslaved populations. Although it is known mostly for its ill-fated and ill-administered attempt to guide freedmen through emancipation, in its brief life from 1865 to 1872, the bureau also became the first public-health agency for black people, as existing municipal and charity health infrastructure built for white people in the South denied them aid. “These institutions, which had historically offered universal support to the poor and dispossessed,” Downs writes, “began to claim that they would only assist ‘citizens.’” After white supremacy brought Reconstruction to a violent and premature end, medicine evolved along those same dividing lines of white citizens and black outcasts. America’s developing peculiar, private, decentralized, job-pension-based health-care infrastructure was the only fit for a modernizing society that could not abide black citizens sharing in societal benefits, and one where black workers had often been carved out of the gains of labor entirely. As German Prime Minister Otto Von Bismarck’s Health Insurance Bill of 1883 created the first modern national health-care system, and as many other countries moved down the path to truly nationalized, universal health care, America instead largely expanded the existing segregated system of local private providers and religious-based charity care. In essence, the United States’s peculiar private-based health-care system exists at least in part because of the country’s commitment to maintaining racial hierarchies. The results were deep racial disparities in almost every major disease, an enduring gap in lifespans and mortality, and the creation of entirely separate medical and public-health infrastructures. According to Smith, key figures within the resulting isolated black health infrastructure  “ended up becoming the real leadership of the local chapters of the NAACP,” and spearheading local movements against Jim Crow. Emerging leaders in the mid-20th-century included people like Simkins and Cobb, as well as national NMA president and Mississippian T.R.M. Howard, who mentored the Evers brothers and Fannie Lou Hamer, and played a leading role both in the investigation of Emmett Till’s death and also in the creation of Medicare. The Medical Committee for Human Rights inherited that mantle of health-care and civil-rights activism and organizing in the 60s. Thomas J. Ward’s Out in the Rural: A Mississippi Health Center and Its War on Poverty details how the MCHR coalesced from a group of black and white physicians participating in Freedom Summer in 1964. Among that group, public-health champions H. Jack Geiger, Bob Smith, and John Hatch pushed to build the first rural community health center in the United States, in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and created community health centers as one of Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty” programs. They also set their sights squarely on universal health-care as a necessary component of the civil-rights agenda. The passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 helped deliver some portion of that agenda, but as with every other civil-rights victory, the backlash was strong. The MCHR, NAACP, and NMA would encounter resistance to both the prospect of universal health care and to the use of existing systems to end health disparities that utilized the full muscle of white supremacy. Even as members of the MCHR listened to King’s speech in Chicago, the AMA was digging their heels in against the prospect of integrating the expanding Medicare and Medicaid programs. Using the successful, red-baiting cudgel of “socialized medicine,” and armed with the first major political advertising firm, the AMA, health-care industry organizations, and their conservative allies had already defeated a 1947 proposal from President Truman to create a true national health-care plan. Although they could not stop the remnants of that plan from eventually becoming Medicare and Medicaid, that coalition was able to obstruct further progress towards coverage for “able-bodied” adults and the creation of a coherent universal guarantee to care. They might not have known it at the time, but for those activists in 1966, health care had already become a dead end. After King’s death in 1968, and the disintegration of the civil-rights movement, opposition from the AMA-led coalition would stymy the last organized effort from the MCHR to create and pass a single-payer bill. That failure also cemented the basic composition of American health-care: a patchwork dominated by private employer-based insurance, where non-elderly people who couldn’t afford or didn’t have such offers, and didn’t fall into narrow special Medicaid eligibility groups were largely left out. And it’s no coincidence or secret that those left out were more likely than not to be people of color. That basic shape remained all the way until 2010, when Democrats and President Obama pulled off the multi-pronged policy and legislative maneuver that became the ACA. Obamacare, as that law came to be known, wasn’t the universal health-care guarantee or the single-payer system that civil-rights activists had pushed for decades, especially after the Supreme Court gutted the core provision of its Medicaid expansion to low-income adults and made it state-optional. Instead, Obamacare sidestepped the political pitfalls of such a plan by attempting alchemy, hoping to entice states to choose to expand Medicaid guaranteed coverage for low-income people, creating a subsidy and non-participation penalties instead of a guarantee for middle-income people, and generally trying to bend the health-care industry against its own exclusionary nature with large sums of money. Still, even though the ACA isn’t a single-payer or universal system, it did a better job than the status quo ante at ensuring some sort of access to care. According to J. Nadine Gracia, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health and the Director of the Office of Minority Health at HHS—positions and an office that were themselves reauthorized and expanded by Obamacare—the ACA’s benefits were immediately realized in communities of color. “The Affordable Care Act is the most important law to help reduce health disparities since the passage Medicare and Medicaid,” Gracia said, “because the law is addressing issues of access, affordability, and quality of care, which have all been obstacles and barriers that relate to the health of minorities.” For former Surgeon General David Satcher, whose work has helped popularize the concept of health disparities and kept the dream of universal coverage alive in the interim between Medicare and Obamacare, the ACA is a stepping stone. “I think we've made some progress with the Affordable Care Act, but as you know that has been greatly limited by the politics of Washington,” he told me. “We haven't gotten half as far as we could've gotten with that because the ultimate goal is that everybody will have access to quality health-care.” But if current events are any indicator, half as far may be as far as America gets. There is a broad consensus among health organizations (now including the AMA), former officials like Satcher, and the former titans of the civil-rights movement that the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) in the Senate and the American Health Care Act (AHCA), its sister bill in the House, will move America away from eliminating racial inequalities in health and health care. In addition to changes in private insurance that will make plans less comprehensive and less useful for sicker and poorer people—within which people of color are overrepresented—the BCRA also eliminates the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to low-income adults and constrains the underlying Medicaid program to the point where in the future states will have no choice but to cover fewer people. In essence, the BCRA not only erases the ACA’s market-oriented experiment in health equity, but also strikes a blow at the previously established elements of “socialized medicine” that were longtime objectives of the civil-rights movement. In this—as is true of other civil-rights victories that were the bedrock of the 50s and 60s liberation movement, like education and voting rights—a central tenet of American freedom now finds itself in danger of simply vanishing. The country cannot follow through on its commitment to equal protection for life and liberty under the law without addressing fundamental inequalities in mortality. It’s worth noting that much of the animus behind the opposition to Obamacare is tied to race. Studies have shown that racial prejudice is a good predictor of opposition to the bill, and its central policy of Medicaid has always been subject to implicit racial biases in public opinion. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found that Republican voters tend to view Medicaid as welfare, with all the attendant stereotypes and dog whistles. Much of that implicit opposition was summed up in a famous 2009 rant from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who called the plan “reparations,” and said it reflected Obama’s belief that “this country was immorally and illegitimately founded by a very small minority of white Europeans … and it’s about time that the scales were made even.” The irony is that Mr. Limbaugh was correct about the bill in one respect: It did disproportionately help the poor and people of color, and in doing so, begin to correct a centuries-old injustice. In a statement defending his signature policy in May, President Obama articulated just why the ACA was such a historic piece of legislation. “When I took office, millions of Americans were locked out of our health care system,” he wrote. “We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody.” Contrary to Obama’s statement, the ACA actually didn’t manage to make health care a right, nor has it allowed all of those locked-out people into the system. But it does come closer to those goals, and does grant access to millions of people of color who had been left out for generations. Unfortunately, the law has also triggered the same conservative immune response that killed single-payer in the past; the same kind of response that King so eloquently railed against in Chicago. With 51 votes and a presidential signature, Republicans can begin turning back the clock.","JUNE 28, 2017"
"Obesity, Not Old People, Is Making Healthcare Expensive - The Atlantic",4471,"Since 1900, the average American lifespan has increased by 30 years, or by 62 percent. That nugget comes near the beginning of a new report taking stock of the U.S. healthcare system, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week, and it’s also pretty much the last piece of good news in it. The study authors—a combination of experts from Alerion Advisors, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Rochester, and the Boston Consulting Group—take a point-by-point look at why healthcare costs so much, why our outcomes are comparatively poor, and what accounts for the growth in medical expenditures. In the process, they brought to light a number of surprising realities that debunk popular misconceptions about health spending. Here are some of the juiciest: The aging population doesn't account for most medical spending. Actually, chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, among people younger than 65 drive two-thirds of medical spending. About 85 percent of medical costs are spent on people younger than 65, though people do spend more on healthcare as they age. “Between 2000 and 2011, increase in price (particularly of drugs, medical devices, and hospital care), not intensity of service or demographic change, produced most of the increase in health’s share of GDP,” the authors write. The costliest disease with the fastest growth rate was hyperlipidemia—high cholesterol and triglycerides—for which spending grew by 14.4 percent annually between 2000 and 2010. The U.S. doesn't have the best healthcare system in the world. This is a frequent point that Obamacare opponents make when advocating for the status quo, but in fact, much of the southern U.S. has a life expectancy that’s lower than average for the OECD, a set of industrialized nations that’s commonly used for comparison. And while Americans rate their experiences with the U.S. healthcare system as generally positive, other countries within the OECD are just as satisfied, even though their medical care is much cheaper than ours. Spending more on IT is not necessarily making our health system more cost-efficient. Both government and private spending on IT has been ramping up over the last decade, and it now adds up to about 3 percent of hospital or doctors’ office expenditures. In short, your doctor now has an iPad! But does that actually help patients? It’s true that some health systems, such as the VA and Kaiser Permanente, have used things like electronic medical records to better coordinate care, resulting in less paperwork for the patients and better communication among specialists. But health IT’s impact on cost reduction is less apparent, the authors note. In the U.S., billing and administrative costs still account for 13 percent of healthcare revenue, compared with 6.6 percent in Canada, to name just one example. “Information technology investments may have reduced costs from what they would otherwise have been,” the authors note, “and likely only partially account for their enormity, but have not made U.S. system administration efficient by any measure. The rate of increase in medical costs has actually slowed. Healthcare is expensive and getting more so, but since 1970, the rate of yearly increase in healthcare costs has declined, particularly since 2002. The authors partly attribute this decrease to the recession. Consumers aren't the ones paying for an increasing share of medical costs. Though it often may feel like out-of-pocket expenses are growing disproportionately to the cost of healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, and federal employee plans have actually picked up an increasingly larger share of the tab. Personal out-of-pocket spending declined by half since 1980 (from 23 percent to 11 percent). Both commercial payers (insurance companies) and the government (through Medicare and Medicaid), meanwhile, are now responsible for 90 percent of hospital and physician costs. Ultimately, the authors conclude that physicians, patients, and insurers all want different things from healthcare. The patient wants to see the best doctors and get the best treatments available, the insurer wants to save money and send the patient to less-expensive doctors, and doctors want to preserve autonomy and ensure they’re getting paid fully for all the services they provide. How we resolve the tension between those different desires will determine what American medicine looks like—and how much it costs—in future years.","NOVEMBER 14, 2013"
Segregated Health Care - The Atlantic,7508,"Sixty-two years ago Tuesday, the Supreme Court passed down its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, finding that “segregation is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.” That decision, pertaining to de jure segregation in public schools, became the groundwork for dismantling many of the formal systems of racial segregation that pervaded both the South and the North in the century following the Civil War. Brown v. Board was a key milestone in the civil-rights movement, and a key weapon for that movement’s future successes. Ever since, the anniversary of Brown v. Board has provided an opportunity for assessing just how far the country has come since the Jim Crow days of naked segregation. The results have been, at best, mixed. Last year, one such assessment detailed the rise of “apartheid schools” that are virtually all black, and the corresponding re-emergence of de facto segregation in public education. Some schools, such as those of Cleveland, Mississippi, still face new court orders to integrate. In other policy areas, the “new Jim Crow,” inspired by Michelle Alexander’s book of that name, has come to be used as an apt categorization of broad disparities in criminal-justice policy. Housing segregation is still rampant, and segregation of black people in areas of concentrated poverty has only accelerated in the past decade. But one of the most enduring—and least noticed—areas of racial segregation even after Brown v. Board has been health care. Segregation is baked into the way people and institutions discuss health care at its most basic levels. Racial differences in almost every health outcome—from infant mortality to life expectancy––are obvious and pronounced, especially between white people and black people. Perhaps because of the sheer size of the evidence of health disparities, all sides of health-policy debates acknowledge their existence, a consensus that has yet to be achieved in debates about education or criminal justice. Yet segregation in health care is rarely discussed in those terms, and its importance in shaping the larger narrative of race in America is often ignored. Like other forms of segregation, health-care segregation was originally a function of explicitly racist black codes and Jim Crow laws. Many hospitals, clinics, and doctor’s offices were totally segregated by race, and many more maintained separate wings or staff that could never intermingle under threat of law. The deficit of trained black medical professionals (itself caused by a number of factors including education segregation) meant that no matter where black people received health-care services, they would find their care to be subpar compared to that of whites. While there were some deaths that were directly attributable to being denied emergency service, most of the damage was done in establishing the same cumulative health disparities that plague black people today as a societal fate. The descendants of enslaved people lived much more dangerous and unhealthy lives than white counterparts, on disease-ridden and degraded environments. Within the confines of a segregated health-care system, these factors became poor health outcomes that shaped black America as if they were its genetic material. The sweeping tide of Civil Rights papered over the fissures that were built into Jim Crow-era health-care, but progress was slow and proved much more difficult to assess than progress in education or housing. Generations of strict geographical segregation left hospitals that served black people deeply segregated, understaffed, and under-resourced. The number of black physicians has never come close to matching their demographic share of the total population. Unlike the temporary integration gains in education, there is no real high-water mark for the state of health-care integration. The 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act aimed to set that mark. The ACA functioned as a stealthy civil-rights achievement of the Obama presidency, promising to make health care less of a financial burden, end disparities in health-care coverage, ease barriers to access for people of color, and subsidize preventative health-care services that proved especially lacking in black neighborhoods. Although the ACA has undoubtedly succeeded at some of those metrics and is still being evaluated for some others, the Supreme Court’s 2012 decision in NFIB v. Sebelius seriously weakened its most key provision. The broad Medicaid expansion to poor people was effectively turned into a state opt-in, and state decisions to expand Medicaid have so far been largely based on ideological grounds. Southern conservative governors and legislatures opposing the ACA on party lines or concerns about expanded federal authority and the costs of the program have formed most of the resistance to the ACA. And many of their states have large black populations. Seven of the ten states with the highest black populations chose not to expand Medicaid. Overall, more than half of the people who are now categorically unable to access any affordable health coverage are people of color. Thirty percent of people without affordable coverage options are black. The ACA could still be the rising tide that lifts all ships. The law has resulted in record lows in uninsured rates, a development welcome in communities of color, where rates are dropping the fastest. Black people were also historically vulnerable in the states that chose to expand Medicaid, and provisions for community health centers, preventative care, and physician training might end up reducing segregation in purely utilitarian terms. It is also very early in the history of the ACA, and its true impacts are likeliest to be felt—and best measured—over decades. But even at its best, the ACA alone probably can’t solve all of the problems posed by health-care segregation, and coverage exclusions could engender a whole new class of problems. Neighborhood segregation is still correlated with the likelihood of hospital closings, and the safety-net hospitals that often serve black people have been under extraordinary financial stress, which shows up in outcomes and quality of care. Neighborhood segregation is generally linked to poor health outcomes and less extensive treatment options from physicians. Health care providers are less likely to provide certain screening options for black patients, even with an increased focus on preventative health in the ACA. Despite shortages of doctors of color, these understaffed physicians’ offices are more often than not responsible for sicker patients of color. And with the racialization of exclusion from affordable coverage, in essence the health of people who are already healthier is subsidized while those who have historically needed coverage the most are left out. Over six decades after desegregation kicked off in earnest with Brown v. Board, America has not traveled far in its journey to escape health-care segregation. At every turn of life, black people and the greater community of color are still beset with a minefield of health-care dilemmas that don’t always exist for everyone else, as they have always been. The ACA represents a crossroads, and the fulfillment of over a half-century of integration rhetoric depends on how future policies embrace its spirit of change. The health-policy debate over the next several years will help answer the most basic question at the heart of every debate about segregation: Just what does America want to be?","MAY 18, 2016"
The American Health-Care System Increases Income Inequality - The Atlantic,9163,"For most people, a single doctor’s visit can be a financial obstacle course. Many patients throughout the year pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in premiums, most often through workplace contributions. Then, at the doctor’s office, they are faced with a deductible, and they may need to pay coinsurance or make a copayment. If they have prescriptions, they’ll likely fork over cash for those, too. And that’s just for basic primary care for one person. Repeat that process for an entire family; add in any labs, referrals, specialists, emergency-room visits, and surgeries; and the result for even healthy families is dozens and dozens of payments, and often thousands of dollars. This series of expenditures before, during, and after care is euphemistically called having “skin in the game.” But the reality is, the American insurance system is designed to make health care financially unpleasant, often to the point where patients forego necessary care. A new study in the forthcoming March issue of the American Journal of Public Health sheds light on just how all that “skin in the game” affects the material conditions of patients. The research—by Andrea Christopher at the Boise Veterans Affairs Medical Center, David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler at the City University of New York at Hunter College, and Danny McCormick at Harvard Medical School—indicates that household spending on health care is a significant contributor to income inequality in the United States. It also indicates that medical expenses push millions of Americans below the federal poverty line, including 7 million people who make more than 150 percent of the poverty level. Four million of those Americans are pushed into the ranks of extreme poverty. That health-care costs in the country are expensive—often, prohibitively so—is well known. As Vox’s Sarah Kliff notes, the first reason why is the exorbitantly high cost of care, which doesn’t always correspond with measurable increases in quality or demand. Even for routine procedures or precautionary visits, hospital bills can run over $400, an expense that almost half of American households can’t meet without dipping into credit. Additionally, billing is famously opaque, incoherent, and fragmented, creating major barriers to informed care decisions and often resulting in bills going into collections. Health insurance is supposed to mitigate those cost and information barriers. A 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found that while significant numbers of Americans have trouble paying medical bills, only 20 percent of insured people had difficulty versus half of all uninsured people. Most of that difficulty for both groups comes from sudden medical events or accidents, or sudden life events like the loss of a job. Medical debt is also a major contributor to bankruptcy in the United States. One of the major arguments for the Affordable Care Act was in its name: a promise to help shield people from the worst financial effects of medical catastrophe or chronic illness. New avenues of subsidized or free health insurance that sprang from Obamacare—including private insurance offered on the exchanges and expanded Medicaid rolls in many states—have been able to do some shielding. The ACA helped reduce total bankruptcies by as many as 1.5 million between 2010 and 2017. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that, between 2011 and 2016, the percentage of Americans with trouble paying medical bills dropped precipitously. And a 2017 study by the Urban Institute’s Kyle Caswell and Timothy Waidmann found “improved credit scores, reduced balances past due as a percent of total debt, reduced probability of a medical collection balance of $1,000 or more, … and a reduction in the probability of a new bankruptcy filing” for people in Medicaid-expansion states. But the new AJPH study complicates some of that rosy analysis. The researchers didn’t split the survey population up based on insurance status; they instead measured income inequality across the population, both before medical expenses were taken into account and after. They found that income inequality in 2014 actually increased by 1.5 points after medical expenses were subtracted from income. Put another way, poor people spent much more of their income on health care than the richest people did, and as a result around 1.5 percent of all relative income shifted toward the higher earners. The researchers also found that medical spending sent millions of people effectively into poverty or into deeper rungs of poverty. Seven million Americans making more than 150 percent of the federal poverty line—$31,000 for a family of three—dropped below that line if medical expenses were subtracted from their income. That meant that these families spent something like a third or more of all their income on health care. Of the 7 million, 4 million found their post-health-care income reduced below 50 percent of the poverty line, meaning they spent about two-thirds of their total income on health care. The study also found that the ACA decreased the amount of inequality caused by health-care expenses, but only slightly. There are some limitations to how far these results can be interpreted. It’s possible that, since 2014, continued gains in insurance coverage—at least until the uninsured rate rose in 2017—combined with additional states expanding Medicaid, decreased coverage costs; a more recent study would be needed to say for sure. Also, without insurance-enrollment breakdowns, it’s impossible to see where and why the biggest gaps in income inequality emerge, and the exact role the ACA may have played in fixing them. Still, the study adds to the body of evidence on the dramatic impact of health-care costs. Even with Medicaid as a safety net, health care is a major burden for low-income people—so much so that it deeply exacerbates differences in income and wealth. One major reason for this burden, perhaps even especially under the ACA, is deductibles. While almost the whole of the national health-care debate has centered on how to lower premiums, the ACA and other health policies have in many cases purposefully driven deductibles upward. More Americans say they have trouble affording their deductibles than they do affording their premiums. Between 2006 and 2017, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that deductibles for people with employer-sponsored insurance increased fourfold. The out-of-pocket maximums on many of these plans also increased sharply. Many of these hikes came from an across-the-board embrace of so-called high-deductible plans, which have been theorized to limit both utilization of health care and the burden of premiums. The tradeoff for those lower premiums is that those who use their insurance have to pay a lot more to do so. As a 2017 Atlantic investigation showed, this theory can often create two kinds of adverse outcomes when put into practice. Many people simply spend what they need to to cover health-care costs, draining their savings and income as they go. And many who don’t turn to crowdfunding to pay their bills, or go without care in the first place. Technically, these outcomes reduce the number of medical bankruptcies—a victory for policymakers—because even high-deductible plans place a hard cap on medical expenditures. Yet even as Americans are better protected from the worst consequences of catastrophic illness, routine care continues to hurt low-income people’s finances. The ACA isn’t really designed to combat that particular paradox. In fact, the law at times embraces it. It juiced up the comprehensiveness of most plans, and it shields people from the true cost of premiums through a number of mechanisms. But in exchange, the structure of the high-deductible plan was accepted as a basic mechanism for both rationing and budgeting. While cost-sharing reductions were introduced to put a cap on the burden that deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance place on low-income Americans, 90 percent of all people on the exchanges still pay deductibles in excess of $1,300 individually or $2,600 per family, amounts that are often difficult to afford even for middle-class families. Republican plans to create a new health-care regime would, for the most part, only increase that difficulty, because both the Senate and House bills to repeal Obamacare increased deductibles even further. President Trump, meanwhile, has stopped paying cost-sharing reduction payments and signed a tax law that repealed the individual mandate to purchase insurance. Both of these actions could increase premiums, thus giving some patients yet another financial burden to worry about. The new study functions as a reminder that policymakers seeking to address income and wealth inequality cannot do so without continuing to address health care, still one of the most constant sources of financial woe in American life. That includes both the absolute cost of health care and the myriad ways the cost is passed onto people with insurance. Until those problems are mitigated, having “skin in the game” for the poorest Americans translates to losing financial ground.","JANUARY 20, 2018"
Universal Healthcare Doesn't Mean Waiting Longer to See a Doctor - The Atlantic,2725,"Opponents of healthcare reform have, historically, argued that we should be wary of imitating foreign healthcare systems because people in other countries have to wait longer to see the doctor. Cheaper, more universal care, the argument seems to be, comes with the tradeoff of slower care. This is not necessarily true, according to new numbers from the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan organization that studies industrialized healthcare systems around the world. The organization surveyed between 1,000 and 5,400 people in 11 industrialized nations. The first thing they found is fairly well-known: American healthcare is mind-bogglingly expensive, as compared to that of other Western democracies: Americans are far more likely to experience a ""cost-related"" access issue or to spend more than $1,000 out of pocket than citizens of other countries. But what's less talked-about is that we don't actually get better access to medical care for our money. People in many countries that spend far less on healthcare than the U.S. are more likely to say they can usually get a same-day or next-day appointment when they need it, and to say they can get after-hours treatment without going to the ER. This is true for countries that have single-payer systems, like the U.K. (though not Canada), and for many Western European countries that have multi-payer systems like ours. The one access measure the U.S. performed slightly better on was in the ability to get specialist appointments within two months. However, more than half of all U.S. doctors' visits are paid to a primary care physician, and the most commonly cited reason is a cough, according to the CDC. And even so, people in Switzerland and the U.K. were both still more likely to say they waited four weeks or less for a specialist appointment than Americans were. This is not to say that America's healthcare reform will alleviate wait times for primary care (in fact, just the opposite may occur.) But other countries have less of a disparity between specialist and primary care salaries, much cheaper medical school, and less paperwork requirements for doctors in GP positions—all factors that help incentivize more primary care physicians and, sadly, extend beyond the scope of the Affordable Care Act. So much of the uproar over the recent insurance plan cancellation notices has been prompted by fears that the affected people will no longer be able to see the doctors they prefer or to get treated as quickly as they'd like. But compared to the rest of the Western world, that's already the reality for many Americans. This report is just a sign that some countries have found a way to not only insure more people, but to get them the care they need faster.","NOVEMBER 19, 2013"
Everything You Need to Know About the Healthcare Slowdown - The Atlantic,4845,"Healthcare spending is growing slower than the economy for the first time since 1997. And nobody knows why. It might just be the shadow of the Great Recession. Or a move towards more high-deductible plans. Or maybe, just maybe, Obamacare's cost controls. There's evidence for all of them. But, contra Matt Yglesias, it does matter which is most responsible, because that tells us how long this slowdown might last. So let's take a look at them all, and try to figure out if the cost-curve is bending or just taking a break from its march to infinity and beyond. The best evidence that Obamacare isn't causing our healthcare slowdown is that it isn't our slowdown. It's the world's slowdown. As you can see in the chart below from the OECD, healthcare growth rates fell almost everywhere between 2009 and 2011. Anything big happen then? Oh, that's right, the end of a once-in-three-generations (we hope) financial crisis. Take another look at the countries with the least healthcare growth after 2009. It's a who's-who of economies that got obliterated by the crisis: Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Estonia, and Portugal. In other words, it sure seems like the recession must explain a big chunk of this global slowdown. And it seems even more like if you directly compare GDP growth with healthcare growth over this period. As you can see below, there's a pretty strong relationship between the two—economic growth explains about half of healthcare growth after the crash (Note: The U.S. is the yellow dot). But some of our slowdown is ours, and not just because of the Great Recession. As former OMB chief Peter Orszag points out, Medicare spending—which shouldn't depend on the state of the economy—actually fell in 2013. Why? Well, we don't really know, but we hope that it's related to the two recent mini-revolutions in our healthcare system: making people pay more, but not for things they don't need. It's a simple enough idea. Make people pay more out-of-pocket, and they won't spend as much on healthcare. They'll be price-conscious, and won't order tests they don't really need—or so the story goes. Now, there's only so much this can save when the sickest 5 percent of patients account for half of all healthcare spending. But it can still help. It has. Economists Amitabh Chandra, Jonathan Holmes, and Jonathan Skinner report in their Brookings paper that higher deductibles have indeed slowed private insurance utilization the past few years. But how much higher? Well, a lot. As you can see in the chart below from Chandra, Holmes, and Skinner, average deductibles have almost doubled since 2006. A big part of that is companies looking to pass healthcare costs onto their employees during the Great Recession and our not-so-great recovery. But it's not enough to give patients incentives to use less care. You have to give doctors incentives to offer better care too. More cost-effective care. Right now, we have a ""fee-for-service"" model where doctors get paid more the more tests they perform, regardless of whether those tests were necessary. Obamacare tries to change that by changing Medicare. It's set up doctor networks called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) that try to coordinate care to make it more efficient—along with offering bonuses for keeping costs below target. Now, we don't know if this is going to work, but there are already some encouraging signs. Medicare's hospital readmission rate, for one, has already fallen well below its 2007-11 average now that they have a financial reason to do so. In other words, hospitals are making sure patients keep getting the care they need after they leave, so they don't need to come back. It's not sexy, but getting a million little incentives like this right will be the difference between ""bending the cost-curve"" or not. Rising healthcare costs are the biggest threat to our fiscal future. But if the current slowdown continues, that threat mostly disappears. So the trillion dollar question is whether this is a blip or the start of a trend. It's hard to say. It's true that the recession, a drop-off in new and expensive drugs, and one-time savings from higher deductibles have all been big parts of this slowdown. And they're big parts that will go away. But it's also true that Obamacare's reforms have played a part, and will continue to do so. Not so much that costs keep growing this slowly, but they don't need to for us to avoid a fiscal crunch. They just need to grow slower—like Medicare has. Its spending has been flat the past year, and that has very little, if anything, to do with the recession. Now maybe it will start quickly increasing again, and this all will be moot. But maybe not. Maybe the long-term cost-curve is bending, and our long-term budget outlook isn't that scary after all. The craziest thing is that it's not. It's just optimistic.","JANUARY 11, 2014"
What 'Health Care Costs' Really Means - The Atlantic,7034,"Framing our problem in terms of ""costs"" is a misrepresentation of the real challenge -- how to slow the increase in spending. No fiscal policy event is complete without the plaintive cry that health care costs are out of control. The phrase has become a form of rhetorical boilerplate that is often used to imply that policy makers are helpless in the face of market forces, and that the only way to reduce ""costs"" is either cutting benefits or rationing. Let's take a look at what the phrase ""health care costs"" really means. It turns out, everybody uses the term to mean something different. Politicians talk about costs in reference to federal and state spending on health care. When hospital administrators and physicians talk about health care costs, they are usually referring to their costs of production, the money they spend on the resources needed to care for patients. Business leaders use the term health care costs when what they really mean is the price of insurance, or the amount they spend on their employees' health care insurance plans. Meanwhile, everybody bemoans out of pocket costs, the amount patients must fork over at the doctor's office and pharmacy counter over and above whatever portion of the bill their insurance covers. And cost is just one more of the terms that means something different depending upon who happens to be using it. This creates confusion even among experts, to say nothing of the public, and it is getting in the way of a frank discussion about how the nation can address the central challenge: that we are spending more and more on health care without seeing equivalent improvements in health. In the interests of clear communication, we propose three distinct definitions for three words: cost, price, and spending. We'll start with cost. The simplest and most sensible use of ""health care costs"" is in reference to the cost of production of health care services. In order to give a patient a CT scan, a hospital has to have purchased a scanner. It must also pay a technologist to perform the scan and a radiologist to read it -- to say nothing of paying for the hospital building itself, chairs in the waiting room, a receptionist at the information desk, and the parking lot outside, all of which are components of the cost of a scan. Price is how much the hospital pays for the scanner, or how much an insurer pays the hospital for the patient to get the scan. In the U.S., prices for everything from a CT scan to an office visit to a stay in the ICU are higher than anywhere else in the world. Even within the U.S. and within the same community, different hospitals can charge wildly different prices for the same service. To make matters worse, prices for medical goods and services have little to do with their true value in terms of improving health. To take just one of any number of examples, elective angioplasty (surgery to reopen narrowed blood vessels in the heart) doesn't prevent heart attacks or reduce angina (chest pain) any better than drug treatment alone, and you already need to be on drug treatment in order to get the surgery. Yet the price of angioplasty is tens of thousands of dollars higher than drug therapy. If we were paying for value in healthcare, two equally good options would fetch about the same price. The last term is spending, probably the most important of the three. The easiest way to define it is the total number of dollars paid for a particular group of people over a set period of time. The most common example is total national health care spending over a year, which last year amounted to $2.7 trillion. You can also talk about spending on a particular type of service, say all CT scans delivered over the course of a year. In that case, the amount we spend depends upon both the price we pay for a scan, and the number of scans we get, or price times quantity. Here's why these distinctions matter. The reason we should be worried about our rising national health care bill is that health care spending is going up faster than the rest of the economy. At current rates, the Congressional Budget Office estimates we'll be devoting the pretty much the entire federal budget and about 50 percent of GDP to health care by 2080. When you think about the federal debt, think health care. Of course, part of the reason health care spending is going up so fast is prices for everything from health care labor to drugs to CT scanners are skyrocketing. But the more worrisome reason for rising spending is the quantity of high technology specialty services we undergo. We get more high tech imaging studies, more days in the ICU, more robotic surgeries than we did 40 years ago, or even 14 years ago. Sometimes that high-tech medicine leads to better outcomes, but a lot of the time it does not -- it just means we spend more. Given this increasing use of high-tech services, it should be easy to see why the ""rising healthcare costs"" frame is misleading: if we're using more and more services each year, it's hardly reasonable to blame rising costs of production. It wouldn't make sense for a family to buy a fleet of luxury cars and then say that they can't afford to pay for their children's education because the cost of gasoline and oil changes has gone up. There may be benefits to owning a fleet of cars. You have your choice every morning of which one to take to work. You can tinker with them on weekends. But unlike owning several cars, there are significant downsides to more and more technological health care, a vast amount of which is simply waste. As much as 30 percent of our health care spending goes towards things that don't make patients healthier, and in fact can harm them. To take just one recent example, a new analysis suggests that most of the recent increase in breast cancer diagnoses are leading women to be diagnosed with and treated for cancers that would never have caused them harm. We also waste money on new, expensive drugs that don't work any better than older, cheaper medications, and on spectacularly pricey procedures, like proton beam therapy for prostate cancer, that have no demonstrated benefits over lower-tech alternatives. The real problem, then, isn't merely that we're spending a larger and larger percentage of our income on healthcare -- it's that we are spending indiscriminately. Yet when healthcare spending rhetorically becomes healthcare costs, it implies that overconsumption of useless, overpriced services is not part of the problem. For now, our plea is simple: politicians, speechwriters, researchers, and others, be clear in your language. It's fine to talk about the cost of production in health care, particularly since most hospitals are shockingly inefficient. And it's fine to talk about prices, especially since there is such a disconnect between the price of many health care products and their value in terms of health. But the most important thing we need to worry about now in terms of the country's long-term fiscal and economic health is rising health care spending.","DECEMBER 22, 2012"
Healthcare.gov and the Inevitably Digital Future of American Governance - The Atlantic,5783,"The Obamacare blame game is in full swing, and without other news to fill pages and airtime, it’s likely to continue for some time. Attention is shifting from the myriad problems with the official website Healthcare.gov, and toward the health plans that are being canceled, even though President Obama promised that they would not be. But the longer-term story isn’t the rollout and its many severe glitches. No one recalls whether the first batch of Social Security checks was sent on time in the late 1930s. The story that will matter, and linger, is that the Affordable Care Act was the first major law implemented almost entirely online. It’s the template for the future, and rather than using its launch as an excuse to renew attacks on the law, we need to learn what we can because, like this bill or not, it is part of the next wave of government. The past two weeks have been filled with various individuals testifying to Congress about the design and implementation of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that allows individuals to access the new health plans and exchanges. The tenor of these hearings, convened by the Republican-controlled House, is that the design of the website exposed the fundamental failings of the law and government incompetence. But what’s actually been exposed is that the U.S. government has not yet made the transition to a digital age. While the administration could have and should have done far better, the reasons for its failure are less about a flawed process than a system currently ill-designed for this type of legislation. It’s safe to say that Congress has never before passed a federal law whose primary mode of delivery is a web portal that will be used by tens of millions of people. And not just one portal, but a portal that serves as a gateway to numerous state healthcare exchanges along with the federal exchanges; a portal that must link up newly designed web pages and interfaces with legacy systems stretching from the Internal Revenue Service to the Veterans Administration to the Medicare and Medicaid systems, none of which are easily compatible or speak the same language. Many in the tech community have tried to analyze what went wrong with the web launch. Some think the government shouldn’t have hired low-bid contractors, choosing agile development teams instead. There was also a lack of sufficient testing of the site before launch, but the site went live anyway because of political considerations. That the site’s code is not public has limited the ability of even savvy tech-heads to fully explain the many problems. What is evident, however, is how inexperienced the federal government is when it comes to developing complicated technology systems unrelated to the defense department. Testing is certainly a major issue. Whenever a large or small tech company releases a new version of software, it is after months of assiduous testing of bugs and glitches in a beta version. Even then, the more complex the programs, the more problems there are. Microsoft for years has earned the reputation of releasing programs that are still flawed despite months of running the code through its paces. Some critics have faulted the administration for similar sloppiness, but in truth, the federal government didn’t have the option to do this kind of beta testing. Imagine the political blowback if an early version of the site had been tested and then scrutinized by adversaries. They would have used the glitches as a compelling case to delay the implementation. Testing publicly only works when there is some consensus on what the outcome should be, which in almost all cases is the actual release of the product. If everyone agreed that the healthcare law was a good thing and required a first tier website, then you could have beta tested it extensively in order to make it better. But when a fair number of people would use the flaws revealed during testing as a way to torpedo the project, optimal testing just can’t be done. Given that, it would have been extraordinary if the site had been launched without major issues. So, how can government deliver in a digital world? The British government recently revamped not just its websites but its approach to creating them, adopting the software development methods that are more reminiscent of Silicon Valley: open sourcing, collaboration and smallish teams. The failures of Healthcare.gov should spark similar changes in the U.S., but the problem with a partisan system of highly atomized political parties is that what works best for implementing policies is frequently trumped by the partisans wanting to prevent that implementation. Right now that means Republicans are determined to halt Obamacare, but it likely will mean Democrats adopting similar tactics when it suits them. Very little of the public debate over the launch of Healthcare.gov, including who was responsible for what, is about what will matter going forward. How government adopts its procedures to meet the needs of digital governance will, because governance is going digital no matter what happens with Healthcare.gov. (Just ask the NSA, whose spying program is nearly all digital in nature.) And yet the United States has a current political system that is ill-suited to make best use of these new tools. Adversarial politics and the lack of government coalitions lead to too toxic of an environment to develop robust technology. But the U.S. also has a surplus of groups and individuals who created this digital sphere in the first place, and they’re highly adept at innovating and creating new systems for both the public and private spheres. We certainly have the capability. It’s yet to be seen if we have the will. This post originally appeared on Reuters.com, an Atlantic partner site.","NOVEMBER 2, 2013"
The Problem With Satisfied Patients - The Atlantic,11477,"When healthcare is at its best, hospitals are four-star hotels, and nurses, personal butlers at the ready—at least, that’s how many hospitals seem to interpret a government mandate. When Department of Health and Human Services administrators decided to base 30 percent of hospitals’ Medicare reimbursement on patient satisfaction survey scores, they likely figured that transparency and accountability would improve healthcare. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials wrote, rather reasonably, “Delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care requires us to carefully consider the patient’s experience in the hospital inpatient setting.” They probably had no idea that their methods could end up indirectly harming patients. Beginning in October 2012, the Affordable Care Act implemented a policy withholding 1 percent of total Medicare reimbursements—approximately $850 million—from hospitals (that percentage will double in 2017). Each year, only hospitals with high patient-satisfaction scores and a measure of certain basic care standards will earn that money back, and the top performers will receive bonus money from the pool. Patient-satisfaction surveys have their place. But the potential cost of the subjective scores are leading hospitals to steer focus away from patient health, messing with the highest stakes possible: people’s lives. The vast majority of the thirty-two-question survey, known as HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) addresses nursing care. For example, in a section about nurses, the survey asks, “During this hospital stay, after you pressed the call button, how often did you get help as soon as you wanted it?” This question is misleading because it doesn’t specify whether the help was medically necessary. Patients have complained on the survey, which in previous incarnations included comments sections, about everything from “My roommate was dying all night and his breathing was very noisy” to “The hospital doesn’t have Splenda.” A nurse at the New Jersey hospital lacking Splenda said, “This somehow became the fault of the nurse and ended up being placed in her personnel file.” An Oregon critical-care nurse had to argue with a patient who believed he was being mistreated because he didn’t get enough pastrami on his sandwich (he had recently had quadruple-bypass surgery). “Many patients have unrealistic expectations for their care and their outcomes,” the nurse said. In fact, a national study revealed that patients who reported being most satisfied with their doctors actually had higher healthcare and prescription costs and were more likely to be hospitalized than patients who were not as satisfied. Worse, the most satisfied patients were significantly more likely to die in the next four years. Joshua Fenton, a University of California, Davis, professor who conducted the study, said these results could reflect that doctors who are reimbursed according to patient satisfaction scores may be less inclined to talk patients out of treatments they request or to raise concerns about smoking, substance abuse, or mental-health issues. By attempting to satisfy patients, healthcare providers unintentionally might not be looking out for their best interests. New York Times columnist Theresa Brown observed, “Focusing on what patients want—a certain test, a specific drug—may mean they get less of what they actually need. In other words, evaluating hospital care in terms of its ability to offer positive experiences could easily put pressure on the system to do things it can’t, at the expense of what it should.” As a Missouri clinical instructor told me, “Patients can be very satisfied and dead an hour later. Sometimes hearing bad news is not going to result in a satisfied patient, yet the patient could be a well-informed, prepared patient.” How far will a hospital go to satisfy a patient? Recently, some have rushed to purchase extra amenities such as valet parking, live music, custom-order room-service meals, and flat-screen televisions. Some are offering VIP lounges to patients in their “loyalty programs.” And because almost every question on the survey involves nurses, some hospitals are forcing them to undergo unnecessary nonmedical training and spend extra time on superfluous steps. Perhaps hospitals’ most egregious way of skewing care to the survey is the widespread practice of scripting nurses’ patient interactions. Some administrators are ordering nurses to use particular phrases and to gush effusively to patients about both their hospital and their fellow nurses, and then evaluating them on how well they comply. An entire industry has sprouted, encouraging hospitals to waste precious dollars on expensive consultants claiming to provide scripts or other resources that boost satisfaction scores. Some institutions have even hired actors to rehearse the scripts with nurses. In Massachusetts, a medical/surgical nurse told The Boston Globe that the scripting made her feel like a “Stepford nurse,” and wondered whether patients would notice that their nurses used identical phrasing. She’s right to be concerned. Great nurses are warm, funny, personal, or genuine—and requiring memorized scripts places a needless obstacle in their path. The concept of “patient experience” has mischaracterized patients as customers and nurses as automatons. Some hospital job postings advertise that they are looking for nurses with “good customer-service skills” as their first qualification. University of Toledo Medical Center evaluates staff members on “customer satisfaction.” By treating patients like customers, as the nurse Amy Bozeman pointed out in a Scrubs magazine article, hospitals succumb to the ingrained cultural notion that the customer is always right. “Now we are told as nurses that our patients are customers, and that we need to provide excellent service so they will maintain loyalty to our hospitals,” Bozeman wrote. “The patient is NOT always right. They just don’t have the knowledge and training.” Some hospitals have hired “customer-service representatives,” but empowering these nonmedical employees to pander to patients’ whims can backfire. Comfort is not always the same thing as healthcare. As Bozeman suggested, when representatives give warm blankets to feverish patients or complimentary milkshakes to patients who are not supposed to eat, and nurses take them away, patients are not going to give high marks to the nurses. More disturbing, several health systems are now using patient satisfaction scores (likely from hospitals’ individual surveys) as a factor in calculating nurses’ and doctors’ pay or annual bonuses. These health systems are ignoring the possibility that health providers, like hospitals, could have fantastic patient satisfaction scores yet higher numbers of dead patients, or the opposite. On the nursing blog Emergiblog, one nurse reported that at a hospital that switched its meal service to microwaved meals, food-service administrators openly attributed low patient scores to nurses’ failure to present and describe the food adequately. It is both noteworthy and unsurprising that the hospital’s response was to tell the nurses to “make the food sound better” rather than to actually make the food better. This applies to scripting, too: It does not improve healthcare, but makes it sound better. The University of Toledo Medical Center (UTMC) launched an entire program based on patient satisfaction, iCARE University, which mandated patient satisfaction course work and training for every university student and employee. “Service Excellence Officer” Ioan Duca told a publication sponsored by Press Ganey, a company that administers the surveys for hospitals, “I am really focused on creating a church-like environment here. We want a total cultural transformation. I want that Disney-like experience, the Ritz Carlton experience.” But hospitals, too, can offer poor care and still get high patient-satisfaction ratings, and an alarming number of them do. I examined Medicare’s provider data for thousands of hospitals—the data on every hospital in the country that the agency makes publicly available. I found the hospitals that perform worse than the national average in three or more categories measuring patient outcome. These are hospitals, in other words, where a higher number of patients than average will die, be unexpectedly readmitted to the hospital, or suffer serious complications. And yet two-thirds of those poorly performing hospitals scored higher than the national average on the key HCAHPS question; their patients reported that “YES, [they] would definitely recommend the hospital.” UTMC is a good example of how an emphasis on patient satisfaction does not make for better care. At the time of this writing, according to government data on hospitals’ rates of readmissions, complications, and deaths, UTMC appeared to be among the worst performers in the state, if not the country. UTMC has higher than average rates of serious blood clots after surgery, accidental cuts and tears from medical treatment, collapsed lungs due to medical treatment, complications for hip/knee replacement patients, and, more generally, “serious complications.” In addition, UTMC made headlines in 2013 when, during a transplant operation, hospital staff threw away a perfect-match kidney that a patient was donating to his sister. Many hospitals seem to be highly focused on pixie-dusted sleight of hand because they believe they can trick patients into thinking they got better care. The emphasis on these trappings can ultimately cost hospitals money and patients their health, because the smoke and mirrors serve to distract from the real problem, which CMS does not address: Patient surveys won’t drastically and directly improve healthcare. But research has shown that hiring more nurses, and treating them well, can accomplish just that. It turns out that nurses are the key to patient satisfaction after all—but not in the way that hospitals have interpreted. A Health Affairs study comparing patient-satisfaction scores with HCAHPS surveys of almost 100,000 nurses showed that a better nurse work environment was associated with higher scores on every patient-satisfaction survey question. And University of Pennsylvania professor Linda Aiken found that higher staffing of registered nurses has been linked to fewer patient deaths and improved quality of health. Failure-to-rescue rates drop. Patients are less likely to die or to get readmitted to the hospital. Their hospital stay is shorter and their likelihood of being the victim of a fatigue-related error is lower. When hospitals improve nurse working conditions, rather than tricking patients into believing they’re getting better care, the quality of care really does get better. Instead, hospitals are responding to the current surveys and weighting system by focusing on smiles over substance, hiring actors instead of nurses, and catering to patients’ wishes rather than their needs. Then again, perhaps it’s no wonder that companies are airbrushing healthcare with a “Disney-like experience,” a glossy veneer. One of the leading consulting companies now advising hospitals on “building a culture of healthcare excellence” is, oddly enough, the Walt Disney Company.

Design Can Improve Healthcare; Can It Also Lead to New Cures? - The Atlantic,6834,"The kind of design thinking championed by Steve Jobs -- human-centered, iterative, and practical -- can fix more than just our gadgets
 Of all the areas of human endeavor touched by Steve Jobs, perhaps few stand to gain as much as healthcare, where the design principles he popularized and demonstrated remain so urgently needed. Yet, his tragic death at the age of 56 also challenges us to ask whether design principles can help drive medical science itself, and identify novel therapies. The greatest legacy of Steve Jobs -- as many have observed (see here, here, and here) may be in design, and specifically, his ability, in the words of Steve Gage, ""to take this enormous complexity and make something a human being could use."" While Steve Jobs did not discover design thinking, he is probably the one person most responsible for our visceral appreciation of the concept. Tim Brown, founder of the design consultancy IDEO, describes (PDF) design thinking somewhat formally as ""a discipline that uses a designer's sensibility and methods to match people's needs with which is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity."" Brown also offers a more useful characterization of design thinking: an ""approach to innovation"" that is ""human-centered, creative, iterative, and practical."" Design is at once an approach and a sensibility (see this [PDF] useful ""bootcamp bootleg"" from the Stanford D-school, or most anything written by Donald Norman). While in some circles (radiating concentrically from Palo Alto, one imagines), design is, if not quite passé, at least associated with irrational exuberance and extravagant expectations (see this 2009 posting by Peter Merholz, founder of the user experience consultancy Adaptive Path, and the energetic dialog his remarks engendered), these principles have made only very preliminary inroads into medicine and healthcare. For starters, medicine is far less ""human-centered"" -- that is, patient-centered -- than most observers appreciate. In the exact same way that well-intentioned engineers often go awry by creating features based on their own perception of what they perceive users must want, medicine has spent a lot of effort focused on a physician's idea of a patient, rather than developing a more nuanced view of life from the perspective of the patients themselves. Physicians have surprisingly little visibility into a patient's day to day health experience -- doctors typically have no idea whether a patient actually took their prescribed medication (data suggest the level of adherence can be shockingly low), took their medication correctly (video studies of patients taking injectible or inhaled medicines reveal remarkable variability), or adhered to behavioral recommendations (you have to ask?). Doctors also have little sense of a patient's daily experience with their disease -- their daily blood pressure, say, or ability to inhale deeply -- to say nothing of less concrete but arguably more important parameters such as mood or quality of life. The physician's episodic assessment of a patient's health, an occasional snapshot, may not always capture all, most, or, in some cases, almost any of the patient's actual experience with disease. Worse still (as discussed here), the absence of more granular knowledge of patients means that doctors have virtually no idea of whether they are providing effective care or not -- are patients even following their advice, is the advice doing any good, and are the doctors even focused on the issues most important to patients? To be sure, some change is in the air; device makers are focusing more intently than ever on the user experience; equipment makers are trying to focus on the use of affordances to reduce human error; a number of hospitals are trying to pay more attention to the holistic needs of their inpatients; and a slew of mobile health companies are developing products that offer the promise of more continuous monitoring and assessment. I've no doubt that design principles can -- and, hopefully, soon will -- help us all do better utilizing the resources (personnel, institutions, therapeutics) we currently have: an enormous accomplishment. But Steve Jobs didn't die at the age of 56 because he didn't like his hospital johnny, or because he accidentally took the wrong pill, or because he wasn't getting the levels of some hormone assessed frequently enough. He died because he had cancer, and he needed an effective drug -- or similar intervention. What does design thinking have to offer here? Can it lead to transformative medical discoveries, to an implementable cure for a particular disease? The honest answer is that we really don't know yet. The jury's still out. My hope -- and at this point, it's only a hope -- is that the more detailed analysis of patients could yield the sort of transformative insights that areas such as oncology so desperately need. I can imagine that if we could more carefully monitor a range of parameters in cancer patients and engage their participation in open data platforms (in a fashion similar to PatientsLikeMe, and as championed by organizations such as Sage), perhaps we would have a greater chance of discovering unexpected relationships, of finding hints of new uses for existing drugs, of developing a deeper appreciation for the underlying networks and relationships driving health and disease. It's also likely that the opportunity to get closer to patients could help improve the total care we provide, a human-centric, iterative, pragmatic approach that is credited for playing a pivotal role in progress in diseases such as pediatric cancer and cystic fibrosis, where a magic bullet has remained elusive. Perhaps most important, a design approach would ensure that we keep our focus on patients, rather than on dubious animal models that are often far more effective at generating research grants and advancing academic careers than they are at providing meaningful insight into a disease afflicting patients. It might also stimulate some of our smartest and most creative basic medical scientists -- researchers who have traditionally been drawn to reductive, highly simplified systems -- to start innovating around patients, trying to develop a far more detailed and relevant understanding of disease as it exists in the organism that ultimately holds our greatest interest and investment: ourselves. Revolutionizing fundamental medical research may be an unreasonably audacious goal, but figuring it out -- finding a way to incorporate in a meaningful fashion the principles of design thinking in the approach and strategy of basic scientists -- is a worthy ambition, and one I suspect Steve Jobs would have felt proud to inspire. Let the conversation begin. Image: IDEO. >","OCTOBER 11, 2011"
The Singular Waste of America's Healthcare System in 1 Remarkable Chart - The Atlantic,1157,"We are an exceptional nation. At least when it comes to healthcare spending. We spend much more than any other rich country, but we certainly don't get more for it. We get less. We get about the same health outcomes, but don't cover everybody like other rich countries do. Now, there are a lot of statistics that show how singularly wasteful our healthcare system is, but the chart below, via Aaron Carroll, is maybe the most visually arresting. It compares life expectancies with healthcare spending per capita for rich and near-rich countries. There's a pretty predictable relationship, with diminishing returns for more spending—and then there's the U.S. See that dot that's almost off the chart? We spend more than four times as much as the Czech Republic does per persona, and live about just as long. The problem is everybody wants the system to change, but nobody wants their corner of it to change. Doctors don't want their pay to change. And patients don't want their coverage to change. Obamacare tries to change both at the margins, and even that is politically fraught. But something has to change. We can't afford our healthcare exceptionalism.","NOVEMBER 23, 2013"
The U.S. Leads the World in Health-Care Spending - The Atlantic,11549,"Iwas standing two feet away when my 74-year-old father slugged an emergency-room doctor who was trying to get a blood-pressure cuff around his arm. I wasn’t totally surprised: An accomplished scientist who was sharp as a tack right to the end, my father had nothing but disdain for the entire U.S. health-care system, which he believed piled on tests and treatments intended to benefit its bottom line rather than his health. He typically limited himself to berating or rolling his eyes at the unlucky clinicians tasked with ministering to him, but more than once I could tell he was itching to escalate. My father was what the medical literature traditionally labeled a “hateful patient,” a term since softened to “difficult patient.” Such patients are a small minority, but they consume a grossly disproportionate share of clinician attention. Nevertheless, most doctors and nurses learn to put up with them. The doctor my dad struck later apologized to me for not having shown more sensitivity in his cuff placement. When he wasn’t in the hospital, my dad blew off checkups and ignored signs of sickness, only to reenter the health-care system via the emergency department. Once home again, he enthusiastically undermined whatever his doctors had tried to do for him, practically using the list of prohibited foods as a menu. He chain-smoked cigars (for good measure, he inhaled rather than puffed). He took his pills if and when he felt like it. By his late 60s, he’d been rewarded with an impressive rack of life-threatening ailments, including failing kidneys, emphysema, severe arrhythmia, and a series of chronic infections. Various high-tech feats by some of Boston’s best hospitals nevertheless kept him alive to the age of 76. It was in his self-neglect, rather than his hostility, that my father found common cause with the tens of millions of American patients who collectively hobble our health-care system. For years, the United States’ high health-care costs and poor outcomes have provoked hand-wringing, and rightly so: Every other high-income country in the world spends less than America does as a share of GDP, and surpasses us in most key health outcomes. Recriminations tend to focus on how Americans pay for health care, and on our hospitals and physicians. Surely if we could just import Singapore’s or Switzerland’s health-care system to our nation, the logic goes, we’d get those countries’ lower costs and better results. Surely, some might add, a program like Medicare for All would help by discouraging high-cost, ineffective treatments. But lost in these discussions is, well, us. We ought to consider the possibility that if we exported Americans to those other countries, their systems might end up with our costs and outcomes. That although Americans (rightly, in my opinion) love the idea of Medicare for All, they would rebel at its reality. In other words, we need to ask: Could the problem with the American health-care system lie not only with the American system but with American patients? One hint that patient behavior matters a lot is the tremendous variation in health outcomes among American states and even counties, despite the fact that they are all part of the same health-care system. A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reported that 74 percent of the variation in life expectancy across counties is explained by health-related lifestyle factors such as inactivity and smoking, and by conditions associated with them, such as obesity and diabetes—which is to say, by patients themselves. If this is true across counties, it should be true across countries too. And indeed, many experts estimate that what providers do accounts for only 10 to 25 percent of life-expectancy improvements in a given country. What patients do seems to matter much more. Somava Saha, a Boston-area physician who for more than 15 years practiced primary-care medicine and is now a vice president at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement, told me that several unhealthy behaviors common among Americans (for example, a sedentary lifestyle) are partly rooted in cultural norms. Having worked on health-care projects around the world, she has concluded that a key motivator for healthy behavior is feeling integrated in a community where that behavior is commonplace. And sure enough, healthy community norms are particularly evident in certain places with strong outcome-to-cost ratios, like Sweden. Americans, with our relatively weak sense of community, are harder to influence. “We tend to see health as something that policy making or health-care systems ought to do for us,” she explained. To address the problem, Saha fostered health-boosting relationships within patient communities. She notes that patients in groups like these have been shown to have significantly better outcomes for an array of conditions, including diabetes and depression, than similar patients not in groups. The absence of healthy community norms goes a long way toward explaining poor health outcomes, but it doesn’t fully account for the extent of American spending. To understand that, we must consider Americans’ fairly unusual belief that, when it comes to medical care, money is no object. A recent survey of 10,000 patients found that only 31 percent consider cost very important when making a health-care decision—versus 85 percent who feel this way about a doctor’s “compassion.” That’s one big reason the push for “value-based care,” which rewards providers who keep costs down while achieving good outcomes, is not going well: Attempts to cut back on expensive treatments are met with patient indignation. For example, one cost-reduction measure used around the world is to exclude an expensive treatment from health coverage if it hasn’t been solidly proved effective, or is only slightly more effective than cheaper alternatives. But when American insurance companies try this approach, they invariably run into a buzz saw of public outrage. “Any patient here would object to not getting the best possible treatment, even if the benefit is measured not in extra years of life but in months,” says Gilberto Lopes, the associate director for global oncology at the University of Miami’s cancer center. Lopes has also practiced in Singapore, where his very first patient shocked him by refusing the moderately expensive but effective treatment he prescribed for her cancer—a choice that turns out to be common among patients in Singapore, who like to pass the money in their government-mandated health-care savings accounts on to their children. Most experts agree that American patients are frequently overtreated, especially with regard to expensive tests that aren’t strictly needed. The standard explanation for this is that doctors and hospitals promote these tests to keep their income high. This notion likely contains some truth. But another big factor is patient preference. A study out of Johns Hopkins’s medical school found doctors’ two most common explanations for overtreatment to be patient demand and fear of malpractice suits—another particularly American concern. In countless situations, such as blood tests that are mildly out of the normal range, the standard of care is “watchful waiting.” But compared with patients elsewhere, American patients are more likely to push their doctors to treat rather than watch and wait. A study published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine suggested that American men with low-risk prostate cancer—the sort that usually doesn’t cause much trouble if left alone—tend to push for treatments that may have serious side effects while failing to improve outcomes. In most other countries, leaving such cancers alone is not the exception but the rule. American patients similarly don’t like to be told that unexplained symptoms aren’t ominous enough to merit tests. Robert Joseph, a longtime ob‑gyn at three Boston-area hospital systems who last year became a medical director at a firm that runs clinical trials, says some of his patients used to come in demanding laparoscopic surgery to investigate abdominal pain that would almost certainly have gone away on its own. “I told them about the risks of the surgery, but I couldn’t talk them out of it, and if I refused, my liability was huge,” he says. Hospitals might question non-indicated and expensive surgeries, he adds, but saying the patient insisted is sometimes enough to close the case. Joseph, like many American doctors, also worried about getting a bad review from a patient who didn’t want to hear “no.” Such frustrations were a big reason he stopped practicing, he says. In most of the world, what the doctor says still goes. “Doctors are more deified in other countries; patients follow orders,” says Josef Woodman, the CEO of Patients Beyond Borders, a consulting firm that researches international health care. He contrasts this with the attitude of his grown children in the U.S.: “They don’t trust doctors as far as they can throw them.” (For what it’s worth, patients in China may be even worse than American patients in this regard. According to one report, they spend an average of eight hours a week finding and sharing information online about their medical conditions and health-care experiences. Various observers have told me that Chinese patients wield that information like a club, bullying doctors into providing as many prescriptions as possible.) American patients’ flagrant disregard for routine care is another problem. Take the failure to stick to prescribed drugs, one more bad behavior in which American patients lead the world. The estimated per capita cost of drug noncompliance is up to three times as high in the U.S. as in the European Union. And when Americans go to the doctor, they are more likely than people in other countries to head to expensive specialists. A British Medical Journal study found that U.S. patients end up with specialty referrals at more than twice the rate of U.K. patients. They also end up in the ER more often, at enormous cost. According to another study, this one of chronic migraine sufferers, 42 percent of U.S. respondents had visited an emergency department for their headaches, versus 14 percent of U.K. respondents. Finally, the U.S. stands out as a place where death, even for the very aged, tends to be fought tooth and nail, and not cheaply. “In the U.K., Canada, and many other countries, death is seen as inevitable,” Somava Saha said. “In the U.S., death is seen as optional. When [people] become sick near the end of their lives, they have faith in what a heroic health-care system will accomplish for them.” It makes sense that a wealthy nation with unhealthy lifestyles, little interest in preventive medicine, and expectations of limitless, top-notch specialist care would empower its health-care system to accommodate these preferences. It also makes sense that a health-care system that has thrived by throwing over-the-top care at patients has little incentive to push those same patients to embrace care that’s less flashy but may do more good. Medicare for All could provide that incentive by refusing to pay for unnecessarily expensive care, as Medicare does now—but can it prepare patients to start hearing “no” from their physicians? Marveling at what other systems around the world do differently, without considering who they’re doing it for, is madness. The American health-care system has problems, yes, but those problems don’t merely harm Americans—they are caused by Americans.",JULY 2019 ISSUE
"Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Are Going to Fix Health Care—Somehow - The Atlantic",4580,"Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway announced on Tuesday that they intend to form a new company that manages health care for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees, the idea being that a unified, not-for-profit entity can reduce workers’ expenses. The surprising trio of the nation’s largest online retailer, largest bank by assets, and most famous investor (Warren Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire) riding to the rescue of the beleaguered health system already rocked insurance stocks and thrilled health-care experts who have long dreamed of a technological solution to “bend the curve” of inexorably rising medical costs. But it’s not altogether clear what this company will be, how much money each corporation will commit to it, or whether it is meant to eventually provide services for workers at other companies. It’s also not clear how the venture will financially benefit the three corporations. “The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” Buffett said memorably, in a statement. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” In other words, this is not the launch of a fleshed-out business venture so much as the public announcement of a corporate collaboration fixated on providing low-cost services and slashing the Gordian knot of ever-rising health-care costs. Here is a brief accounting of knowns and unknowns about the new venture. The new company—operating outside all three corporations—will “provide” health care. But it is not clear whether this will be a pure insurance company or whether it will pay for its own doctors and clinics. The enterprise is supposedly going to use “technology” to lower costs. It is not clear what technology would be employed, or what costs will be lowered, or by how much. The company will be “free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” What does it mean to be free of profit-making incentives, as opposed to actual profits? It’s not clear. While JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway are listed as partners in the endeavor, Amazon would seem to be the galvanizing force behind the announcement. In the last year, the company has explored several health-care businesses, by selling more medical supplies, expanding its inventory of drug products, and hiring an executive to build a possible pharmacy business. These moves have already so spooked the pharmacy and insurance industries that they reportedly pushed CVS to place a $69 billion bid for the insurance giant Aetna. Across the economy, Amazon has become a kind of deflationary Death Star, so well-known for its high-volume, low-profit model that stocks plummet in every sector it threatens to enter. Indeed, within minutes of the announcement, shares fell for pharmacy managers and drugmakers. As of 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, large insurance companies like Anthem and UnitedHealth Group were trading down about 5 percent, while the largest hospital companies, like HCA, ticked up 8 percent. This suggests that investors believe the new health-care company will compete most directly with insurance firms and pharmacies rather than with hospitals and larger clinics. Even so, if the corporate trio really wants to bring down health-care costs, they might try to open a network of low-cost clinics throughout the country that compete with large hospitals for less-complicated care. If health care is, as Buffett describes, a hungry tapeworm, the parasite isn’t growing as fast as it used to. The rate at which medical costs increase each year has, with some exceptions, generally declined since the 2000s. Between 2010 and 2013, the average annual growth rate in health expenditures was scarcely higher than that of GDP. As the economy picked up in 2014 and 2015, medical-cost inflation turned up again. For Amazon to take the lead in taming medical-cost inflation continues an interesting trend in tech, with visionaries like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk taking on the traditional roles of government, whether by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on basic research, sending rockets to space, revolutionizing infrastructure, or building new health-care companies. It might seem a bit ironic that three for-profit corporations would seek to create a nonprofit institution to do what traditionally has been done by the ultimate nonprofit institution—the U.S. federal government. Then again, at a time when libertarian corporate interests have taken over Washington, the work of governance is being outsourced, fittingly, to corporations.","JANUARY 30, 2018"
Malaria and HIV Spike as Greece Cuts Healthcare Spending - The Atlantic,7015,"One day in late March, European finance and health ministry officials met at the OECD's Paris office to discuss how healthcare systems are faring in times of austerity. On the second day of the two-day conference, Greek finance ministry official Evdoxia Andrianopoulou read from a series of brown-colored PowerPoint slides riddled with details of attrition and savings. Greece's cuts were deep, of the sort commonly seen in a corporate turnaround - but rarely on a government's balance sheet, and almost never to healthcare expenses. The takeaway from the meeting - according to two people who attended it - was that Greek officials knew that these huge cuts would result in the curtailing of essential services for their people. But the officials were working under the stress of having to meet a financial target set by their tri-party group of creditors: the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank. And so they delivered. According to an Austrian finance ministry official who attended the meeting, participants in the room ""were in a state of shock"" after Andrianopoulou concluded her talk. Another attendee who asked that he not be quoted said ""a pin-drop silence"" filled the room. Meanwhile, across the Channel in London, academics were preparing to release a study in ""The Lancet"" on the healthcare crisis that has followed deep budget cuts in Southern Europe. One of that work's principal researchers, David Stuckler of Oxford University, warned that not just Greece, but also Spain and Portugal, faced a potential healthcare disaster due to their own steep budget cuts. Yet of the three crisis-stricken countries, Greece seems to have suffered the most. ""Greece is an example of perhaps the worst case of austerity leading to public health disasters,"" Mr. Stuckler explained in a telephone interview. ""After mosquito spraying programs were cut, we've seen a return of malaria, which the country has kept under control for the past four decades. New HIV infections have jumped more than 200 percent,"" he noted. Malaria returned because municipal governments lacked the funds to spray against mosquitoes. HIV spiked because government needle exchange programs ran out of clean syringes for heroin addicts. By Stuckler's estimate, the average Greek junkie requires 200 clean needles in a given year. ""But now they're only getting three a year each,"" Stuckler said. Athenian drug addicts sharing needles or malaria-carrying mosquitoes biting Spartans have put Greece in the media spotlight over the past few months. But a decidedly less headline-grabbing fact is this: cuts taken over the last two years could look even worse a few years from now. ""The thing about healthcare systems,"" the OECD's Ankit Kumar explained in a telephone interview, ""Is you cut the money today, and start to see the cuts' impact at least three to four years from now. You know that people aren't getting their medications. But it takes a couple of years before this manifests itself in high levers or sickness, fewer people being able to work, and more people facing shorter lives. Given the consequences of what has happened in Greece, these outcomes are just going to get worse and worse."" Some experts have suggested that Greece's budgetary ax fell unduly hard on its healthcare sector, which was slated to grow at around 4 percent annually, but which has instead been jolted by a series of wage freezes, firings, and drug rationing programs. Economists around the world warned of the cuts' consequences - but it was the Greeks themselves who opted for deep gashes to their healthcare system. ""IMF doesn't say 'you have to cut 10 percent of your economy, but you can't close hospitals or schools.' Where the cuts are made remains a country's sovereign right,"" Kumar explained. This spring has been an important time for healthcare research in Europe because data now confirm -- as if there were any doubt -- that in healthcare, too, the gulf between Europe's north and its south has continued to widen. Last year, while Greece went about adjusting to its new slimmed-down healthcare reality, German's ministry of health contacted the OECD for its help in studying the exact opposite problem. German healthcare costs were ballooning, but only a third of the growth could be linked to Germans becoming sicker or aging. The OECD's research on Germany was published this spring, at nearly the same time that the full picture of Greece's healthcare tragedy came into form. OECD researchers compared Germany to its peers, and came to a simple conclusion: German doctors seem to be prescribing treatments, operations, and hospital stays more often than might be medically necessary. That this is occurring while Germany's neighbors just a two-hour plane ride away in Athens face the worse healthcare and societal crisis in their history only underscores the much publicized idea that Europe is growing apart. One statistic was especially telling: the OECD average for hospital beds per 1,000 patients sits at 4.9; in the case of Germany, it's 8.3. France has 6.4, while the U.S. has 3.1. ""The difference in the medical science between the United States, Germany, and France is not so great that it can justify 70 percent higher numbers in Germany than the OECD average,"" Kumar said. Kumar and his co-author, Michael Schoenstein, theorized that because Germany has more hospitals than it needs, doctors and hospitals appear to be steering patients towards more expensive in-patient procedures and then tacking on multiple night hospital stays in order to fill hospital beds and submit payments to Germany's essentially unlimited system of insurance reimbursements. ""These are big institutions that want to be busy,"" Kumar said. ""After investing millions, and in some cases billions of dollars, into the infrastructure, no one wants to have these institutions running at 60 percent. They know that if hospitals aren't full, someone's going to point the finger and say 'hold on a second, you're running at 60 percent capacity regularly, why do you have all of these empty beds, we need to get rid of that.'"" The OECD lacks clear data on how many Greeks have been denied medical care during the country's economic crisis. But anecdotal reports have shown that people are being deprived care. The New York Times reported that ""breast cancer patients often have to wait three months now to have tumors removed"" and that at least 2,000 patients in need of bypass surgery haven't been scheduled for procedures. Could the solution to Greeks' healthcare crisis be to send patients north to Germany's hospitals? With Europe's common market, citizens' freedom of movement, couldn't Greeks just fly north for treatment? ""Yes, EU citizens can travel to other EU countries for treatment,"" OECD's Michael Schoenstein explained, ""But for planned treatments like cancer treatments, they need prior approval from their healthcare insurers at home. It's theoretically possible, but practically very difficult.""","MAY 15, 2013"
Obamacare Website Has Cost $840 Million - The Atlantic,2576,"The Obama administration has spent roughly $840 million on HealthCare.gov, including more than $150 million just in cost overruns for the version that failed so badly when it launched last year. The Government Accountability Office says cost overruns went hand-in-hand with the management failures that led to the disastrous launch of HealthCare.gov and the 36 state insurance exchanges it serves. GAO's report, prepared for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday, details a long series of management, oversight, and contracting problems that plagued the entire process, from risky contracting practices in 2011 through the botched launch last October. A massive repair effort got the site stabilized by January, and despite the early failures, the administration ended up exceeding its enrollment target for this year. More than 8 million people chose plans through Obamacare, including the 36 states whose marketplaces run through HealthCare.gov. All the same, GAO says, similar problems could arise again without structural changes in the way the government manages its contracts and spending. Here are the key findings from GAO's prepared testimony: Rep. Fred Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that key pieces of the HealthCare.gov system—including the part that pays insurance companies—still haven't been built. ""The disastrous implementation of the president's health care law has already led to canceled plans, lost access to doctors, and higher premiums,"" Upton said in a statement. ""Now add to that hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on an exchange that is still not ready for prime time."" CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said the agency has already taken concrete steps to improve its management of HealthCare.gov. ""CMS takes its responsibility for contracting oversight seriously and has already implemented contracting reforms that are more extensive than the recommendations in the report, including ending our contract with CGI and moving to a new type of contract with Accenture that rewards performance,"" he said. CMS brought in another contractor, QSSI, to coordinate the HealthCare.gov repair effort and has now directly hired Andy Slavitt, who spearheaded the project for QSSI. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the new Health and Human Services secretary, has also created new positions with direct responsibility for HealthCare.gov and the federally run exchanges. The agency is also in the process of formalizing internal guidelines that aim to prevent unauthorized work orders like the ones GAO discovered.","JULY 31, 2014"
How the U.S. Healthcare System Would Handle Ebola - The Atlantic,9312,"Update September 30, 2014: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that a man currently in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas has the first diagnosed Ebola case in the U.S. The man likely contracted the disease abroad, since he had recently traveled to Liberia. This story, originally published in August, shows how the U.S. healthcare system might deal with an Ebola case. Let’s get one thing straight: You are not going to get Ebola. Donald Trump is not going to get Ebola. You are more likely to be killed by Batman, the ride. Ebola-like viruses have already breached our borders, and there were no secondary infections. There are airport workers whose job it is to identify passengers who have flu-like symptoms and quarantine them immediately. And the disease is only spread through contact with bodily fluids, so there’s little chance that even the unlucky seat-mate of the Ebola flyer would catch it. Nevertheless, Ebola is a rare disease, and the fact that it’s both incurable and highly lethal naturally prompts morbid fascination. So let’s say there was a science-fiction scenario in which you, dear reader, were infected with this deadly hemorrhagic fever. The ways in which the American healthcare system have prepared for such a thing offer some interesting insights into infectious-disease protocols and the pharmaceutical industry. The following is an account of what would happen if you did, in fact, come down with Ebola, according to interviews with a number of infectious disease specialists. You wake up and feel a little weak. It’s almost like you have the flu. You stumble to the medicine cabinet and grab a thermometer. You have a fever, so you pop two Tylenols and go back to bed. The fever does not go away. You see your primary care physician, who says it looks like flu and to call her if the symptoms change. The next day, the fever is going strong, and you feel even worse, wracked with chills and a headache. You remember that you recently butchered a West African fruit bat, for some reason. You call 911. By the time the paramedics come, you look and feel terrible. You spew vomit as they whisk you to the ambulance. The paramedics call the local emergency room to let them know they have a suspected Ebola patient en route. The hospital tells the ambulance to pull into a special bay. The ER personnel run out of the hospital garbed in infection-control gear—most likely consisting of fluid-impermeable gowns, gloves, masks, and face-shields. If the paramedics weren’t properly outfitted during the ambulance ride, they would be quarantined and tested for the virus. Everything you or your bodily fluids touched would be washed with bleach. “If the symptoms look unusual, the hospital would immediately contact the infections disease personnel in the city or state they're in,” said John Auerbach, director of the Institute on Urban Health Research and Practice at Boston’s Northeastern University. (Disclosure: Auerbach is married to Atlantic magazine senior editor Corby Kummer.) “In Boston, it's Anita Barry. They'd say ‘Anita, we have a patient in here with very odd symptoms.’ Anita would tell them, ‘Okay, here's my advice to you: Immediately isolate that patient, and we want a full list of everyone who has come into contact with them.’” You’re wheeled on a gurney to the hospital’s special isolation unit, which has its own air-conditioning system and its own waste-disposal pipeline. The room has negative air pressure, so it doesn’t share oxygen with the rest of the hospital. This seems like overkill—Ebola isn’t transmitted by air—but it helps assuage the worries of the hospital staff. And with some medical procedures, bodily fluids can be aerosolized—blended up into tiny airborne particles—which can spread infection. Your clothes are burned. The hospital has to take blood tests, but it doesn’t have the right tools for testing Ebola samples on-site. Four milliliters of your blood will be drawn into a plastic vial. A glass vial would be too risky, the CDC says. Specimens must be packaged in a sealable plastic bag, wrapped in an absorbent material, inserted in a secondary, leak-proof receptacle, and stuck in an outer shipping package for transport. The test comes back positive. The isolation unit has glass walls so that hospital workers can monitor you without exposing themselves. For blood tests and IV changes, a doctor enters through an anteroom, which is equipped with a shower, where he stores his infection-prevention gear. He wears shoe covers because at this point, you are gushing diarrhea and sweat. Health officials would interview your family and anyone else you’ve interacted with since you began to show symptoms. Your family would be isolated, likely in a similar hospital room, until their lab tests cleared them. Because you’re infected, your family might only be able to wave at you through the glass partition and talk with you through an intercom system. Past strains of Ebola have killed 90 percent of those infected, but this one seems slightly less lethal, at just 55 percent. Still, you don’t like those odds. So far the doctors are giving you supportive care—water and antibiotics—but there’s no cure. There are a few potential therapeutics for Ebola, but none that have cleared human trials yet. In fact, it would take weeks, if not months, for drug companies to develop any sort of reliable treatment. “If we got some kind of an outbreak in the U.S., we're technically screwed,” said Michael Pollastri, an associate professor of chemistry, also at Northeastern University. “It doesn't work like the movies where you get a cure in three days. The thing is with these antibodies, you have to grow them up in living cells. People don’t just run out of the lab and say, ‘I have it right here! Give it to that guy!’” You start to think maybe there’s hope for you in an experimental serum like ZMapp, the drug used to treat the missionaries Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who contracted Ebola while treating patients in Liberia. The first step would be for the hospital to appeal to the FDA for permission to be allowed to use an experimental therapy under the agency’s “compassionate use” provision. The FDA says “yes” 98 percent of the time, so this isn’t your biggest hurdle, according to Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at NYU’s Langone Medical Center. Unfortunately for you, though, neither the hospital nor the government decides who gets experimental treatments; the drug companies do. ZMapp, the antibody given to Brantly and Writebol, is made by a tiny California company called Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. It has nine employees and only a tiny amount of ZMapp. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Mapp is apparently sending ZMapp to West Africa, and it has now depleted its meager supply of the drug. But let’s say there was some ZMapp left. The decision to give it to you would be the manufacturer’s. “There's no authority to compel the company to give you anything,” Caplan said. “A company can set the terms, it can say, ‘Yep, you can have it, you just have to pay us enough money.’” A tiny company like Mapp, Caplan said, might want to recoup its investment. Antibodies like ZMapp typically run in the tens of thousands of dollars per dose, he added. Insurance likely won’t cover it, since it’s an experimental therapy. If they ask you to pay, it’s up to you to either rake together the cash, make some beseeching media appearances, or run one hell of a Kickstarter. “It's a measure of whether you're connected or vocal,” Caplan said. “It's not like we have a system. We don’t.” Fortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, or some other tiny pharmaceutical company, opts to give you an experimental drug for free. It arrives with a set of instructions describing how it worked when the scientists gave it to monkeys, which is the only kind of primate it’s been tested on so far. Until now, that is. There’s no clear-cut dosage, so your doctors embark upon a strange sort of trial-and-error mission, jabbing you with syringes full of the stuff until it starts to look like you’re turning a corner. (Brantly, for example, ended up needing two doses of ZMapp.) After a few days of hiccups—another Ebola symptom—you finally start to feel better. Several weeks after you first fell ill, you stop showing symptoms, are no longer contagious, and can be discharged. Your doctors will want to observe you for side effects, possibly for months after the ordeal. “If the treatment destroys your liver, that’s not a cure,” Caplan said. The effects of Ebola can linger: You might have memory problems and other health issues for up to a year after the fact. Donald Allegra, chair of infection control at Newton Medical Center in New Jersey, said he strongly doubts there would ever be an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. But local public health officials might still be on the lookout for potential Ebola cases among Americans who have recently traveled to West Africa. Several aid groups, including the Peace Corps, are currently repatriating Americans who were stationed in the Ebola-affected nations. According to Allegra, that means that some hospitals might soon be getting calls to the effect of, “I just got back from Liberia and I have a little fever. What should I do?""","AUGUST 12, 2014"
How Arbitration Affects Health Care - The Atlantic,3007,"The next time you’re filling out paperwork in the waiting room of a doctors’ office or nursing home, you might want to look for a phrase buried amid all the legalese and checkboxes. It’ll be something like, “Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.” If it’s there, the provision will significantly change the way you can sue for damages if something goes wrong. The New York Times this weekend investigated the rise of an opaque legal process called arbitration, which has been bolstered by two Supreme Court rulings in recent years. Unlike jury trials, arbitration proceedings are wholly overseen by a retired judge or arbitration-trained lawyer. The Times report finds rampant bias and inconsistent rules within the process. “What rules of evidence apply?” one arbitration firm’s website asks, according to the story. “The short answer is none.” According to the Times’ data, the deck is often stacked in favor of the corporate defendant. “Roughly two-thirds of consumers contesting credit-card fraud, fees, or costly loans received no monetary awards in arbitration,” the paper found. The arbitrator’s ruling is usually final. It’s troubling enough when people can’t get a fair hearing for erroneous credit-card charges or wage theft. But arbitration has also crept into the health-care realm. The Times’ report notes a few such examples: The American Arbitration Association and JAMS, two arbitration firms, told the paper that plaintiffs can dismiss arbitrators they fear are biased. Still, even when plaintiffs win in health-care cases, the closed arbitration process can make it so others never find out about the malpractice. And surveys show that when nursing-home residents’ families sue after wrongdoing, they are more likely to get payouts when they don’t go into arbitration. Over the past few months, health-care publications have been detailing how families unwittingly sign arbitration agreements when checking aging relatives into long-term care facilities, only to find their hands tied later. Modern Healthcare interviewed one woman who said the intake paperwork was “kind of like here's 1,000 papers … Some they explain, and some they don't.” The woman’s mother later died after allegedly being neglected by the facility. When her husband died shortly after being placed in a Minnesota nursing home, a woman named Virginia Cole was forced into arbitration. She won, “but after paying the arbitrators, expert witnesses and attorney's fees, she was left with less than $20,000,” NPR reported. In a September letter, a group of senators called forced arbitration in long-term-care agreements “unfair to residents and their families” and urged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to prohibit senior-care facilities it contracts with from using arbitration provisions. (The American Health Care Association, which represents most nursing homes, has defended arbitration in nursing-home settings, saying they are cheaper and more efficient for the providers and consumers alike.)","NOVEMBER 2, 2015"
"Practical Philosophy, Again - The Atlantic",12372,"I continue to find myself puzzled by John Holbo.  This statement makes no sense to me: This echoes his earlier post.  John Holbo, who is, I believe, a professor of philosophy, seems to believe that you can develop a philosophical opinion on a policy issue without reference to particulars. Imagine a universe consisting entirely of two identical blue spheres.  Is there a right to national health care in that universe?  Please show your work. Obviously you need a very large number of specific priors before you can even think about developing a ""philosophical"" opinion on health care.  Of course, we do need to operate at some level of abstraction. But Holbo's response to me consists of abstracting away all of the potential problems with national health care, and then demanding to know why I don't support it--I mean, apart from the fact that if millions of poor people die, there will be more room on the subway for me.  Libertarians think like that, you know. So I'm not sure that this conversation is likely to be productive, since at least one side of it has decided to substitute sarcasm for engagement.  But let's see if we can't tone down the nastiness a little, and try to have a reasonable discussion. I'm afraid, however, that any discussion will include our assessment of the likely outcomes of our policy decisions.  It's not enough to defend the principles of communism if what you get in practice is a nasty, murderous dictatorship every time. Some philosophic principles: I am sure that John Holbo would quarrel with some of these principles.  But on the broad package that he thinks leads to national health care, we're probably in rough agreement. Yet I do not think that they lead to national health care!  How can this be? Mr. Holbo's answer is that I am an evil idiot who hates poor people, doesn't understand how markets and governments really work, and is philosophically incoherent.  My more boring answer is that we have different assessments of how the world to which we would like to apply these philosophical principles works. For starters, Holbo has a very simplistic view of rationing--or perhaps, the objection to rationing that most libertarians have.  Either it is Britain in World War II, and the government has forbidden you to purchase more than 6 bandaids, or we don't have rationing. This is not true either philosophically, or technically.  That last principle I articulated is only one of the possible objections to rationing--one that I take it Mr. Holbo and I share, unless he is simply unwilling to come out and say he favors letting rich people die if poor people can't get a given treatment.  I might point out that rationing interferes with voluntary transactions, and that if the government wants to redistribute things, it should damn well raise the taxes and buy them.  I could question the justice of whatever regime you come up with.  These are all actual problems with any of the proposals that will be passed. But even after you get beyond that, the more ""practical"" considerations remain.  If the government crowds out private health insurance for many people--a result that a number of analysts on both right and left think (hope) is likely, then the government rationing regime becomes actual rationing for the majority of the population.  There is also the fact that private insurers often base their services around what the government does, setting their rates as a percentage of Medicare rates, using Medicare to define what standard medical practice is, and so forth. The core problem with rationing, for most libertarians, is that even if you think that the government's interference is just--and hey, in the case of World War II, I am probably willing to listen--that it has other effects we recognize as bad.  Black markets breed crime.  Government rules are necessarily extremely broad and will make some people worse off.  But the core issue is that when you disable the price signal, you usually severely degrade the production and distribution of the good in question.  I hate to drag out Hayek again, but that old chestnut is still the single best exposition of why you might choose not to ration, set price floors/ceilings, or otherwise disable the price mechanism, even if you would like to see some more just distribution of the goods in question: Mechanisms to distribute tin without prices have been tried, and found wanting.  So have mechanisms to distribute practically every other good you can think of, from housing to hotdogs.  Rent control distorts the housing market and discourages landlords from building or improving their housing stock.  Price controls on bread result in shortages, and often distort the non-controlled sectors of the market. Fuel subsidies result in your precious tax dollars being diverted to Columbian roadside vendors who will siphon the gas out of your tank at great danger to themselves and pay something closer to market rates for it.  Etc. I mean, fine, let's not call it rationing.  Let's call it ""Fred"".  You'll still end up with a crappy, overcrowded housing stock and shortages of basic goods.  What philosophical principal favors this? Holbo says I'm oscillating between endorsing rationing, and abhoring it.  As it happens, I'm not ""oscillating"" between anything.  For one thing, I'm not particularly worried about IMAC denying treatments to people, though I think it's perfectly rational that seniors are, because frankly right now they get a really great deal. There are two entirely separate questions here.  The first is that we would like everyone to have all the health care they could ever possibly consume, but we can't.  This is true of other goods, like food and housing.  I find the process of figuring out what to produce, or provide, fascinating, which is why I am a business journalist. It is especially important in medicine because of the somewhat unique market.   Whether the government is paying, or private companies are, there will continue to be core tensions between what the doctors want, and what the people writing the checks will approve.  Right now, Medicare and Medicaid handle these problems somewhat differently--they simply slash the reimbursements until some providers refuse to take their patients.  But if the government comes to dominate health care payment, that problem will become more explicit.  One way or another, we're going to have to confront the fact that we can't all have everything we want--and that not having everything we want, in this case, probably includes suffering and earlier death for at least some people. The second problem, which makes a less stirring Sunday supplement article, is that this allocative process can get badly screwed up when the government gets involved.  To take one small example:  we have a comprehensive national health care plan for seniors.  Yet we have a shortage of geriatricians, the one specialty that you would think would be booming.  Why?  Because Medicare sets a single price for the services of geriatricians, and it is low.  Since the field is not particularly enticing (though arguably it really should be, since geriatricians have extremely high job satisfaction compared to many more popular specialties), very few people go into it.  It's one of relatively few specialties that consistently has most of its slots and fellowships unfilled. I've already discussed what I think will happen to new medical technology and prescription drugs under a more comprehensive government system.  For the same reason:  prices are very useful things.  And contra the liberals who keep saying I am maintaining this belief in the face of overwhelming evidence, we in fact have overwhelming evidence for two things: People talking about how Europe is not paying its ""fair share"" of drug development costs have the problem wrong.  Drug companies charge what the market will bear.  Drugs wouldn't be any cheaper here if Europe dropped its price controls.  What we would have is more drugs.  But this is a hidden cost.  And governments almost always prefer hidden costs to explicit ones.  It's just electoral logic. I understand that progressives object to price rationing because it implies that people who don't have the money aren't worth saving.  But the number of people who actually don't get treatment they would benefit from because of their insurance status is small, and there are more direct ways to deal with this problem.  You don't gut rehab an entire industry because 2% of the population can't afford its products.  You figure out a way to help them buy the products. Let me close with two thoughts. John Holbo challenged me in a former post to say what I would think about the various proposals, or a putative single payer system, if it worked just the way progressives think it will.  I thought I had, but I'll do it again.  The answer is that I would be against it because I don't believe in taking money from the rich to subsidize the middle class--I don't think that people whose basic needs are taken care of have any distributional claim on people with more money, even though it is perfectly fair to ask the wealthy to pay more for goods that are broadly publicly enjoyed. If it were up to me, I'd combine a broad income subsidy like the EITC with some sort of reinsurance pool for high-risk patients, then I'd probably force everyone to buy some sort of catastrophic medical coverage on the grounds that otherwise, people with adequate income but few assets will be too tempted to freeload off the generosity of the public.  But anything that involved price controls I would shoot down faster than a duck at an NRA convention. That said, if we end up with some sort of single payer system, and I turn out to be totally wrong and there's no issue with innovation and quality stays high, I will be happy.  I will still object, in principle, to middle class subsidies.  But as an issue for me, it will recede to somewhere between public highways, and the words ""under God"" in the pledge of allegiance. Now, having embraced Holbo's thought experiment, and hopefully illuminating the principles by which I am evaluating future health care plans, I'd hope he'd return the favor.  I've asked once before, but Holbo has so far ignored the question in favor of long disquisitions on what he thinks rationing is.  So here goes again: I've answered your thought experiment, saying what I would do if everything went just as you think and hope it will.  Now please turn the question around and try the same thought experiment.  What if everything goes the way I think it will?  What if converting the United States to a single payer system causes the pace of medical innovation to slow to a crawl?  People who have diseases for which there are not now good therapies lose all hope, because there is virtually no pharma or medtech industry which might invent something to save their life.  Lifespans stop lengthening.  Pharma and medtech turn into fat, soft, government suppliers, using the regulatory power of the healthcare agencies to keep out incumbents.  There are periodic shortages of various treatments because the government has a budget problem, or has gotten the prices wrong--and knowing us, the whole system comes with a ""buy American"" mandate. Is that a tradeoff you would make?  Save the few thousand who might be kept alive by healthcare they now can't afford, and take the possibility of new treatments from the millions who might be cured, or at least have their conditions improved? It's no good dismissing it on the grounds that it's unlikely, because you can't think it any more unlikely than I think the notion of a healthcare reform that is all upside, no downside. I can see the arguments for both sides.  There's no right answer, and certainly no happy one.  I'm well aware that there are real people who may die because of my preferences.  And other real people who may die because of yours.  None of them are any less worthy of life than any other. That's why I found the First Things article interesting:  because it faced up to the fact that on the margin, any choice we make about healthcare has terrible implications.  When it comes to healthcare, we cannot help but play God.  And unlike Him, we are cursed with imperfect knowledge.  All we have is our intuitions, our observations of the world, and our best guess about the future.","SEPTEMBER 2, 2009"
"The U.S. Promotes Universal Health Care, but Only in Other Countries - The Atlantic",3580,"American foreign policy had built such programs abroad since the Marshall Plan, so why not at home? Millions of lives are prolonged or saved throughout the world, thanks to United States-supported health programs. But Americans aren't so lucky. For many, the best way to get affordable treatment at U.S. taxpayers' expense might be to move to a poor country that is committed to building universal coverage, backed by U.S. development aid. The Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act opens the possibility that the United States may now begin to domestically implement policies that foreign aid agencies and the Department of Defense have long supported, both politically and economically, as elements of U.S. foreign policy. It may now be possible to harmonize longstanding U.S. foreign and domestic policies regarding healthcare access for poor and middle class peoples. Dating back to the Marshall Plan in post-WWII Europe, General Douglas MacArthur's 1945-1949 occupation of Japan, and then the Korean War, it has been a matter of U.S. foreign policy to invest in the creation of universal health systems. More recently, the Marshall Plan was cited by AFRICOM in support of a Department of Defense engagement in health systems construction across Africa. This year, South Africa was the number one recipient of health aid from the United States, totaling nearly $470 million, much of which is supporting the country's 14-year program to build universal health coverage. Meanwhile, on the home front, 2012 polling shows that 26 percent of Americans have faced grave financial difficulties due to medical costs, and 58 percent have delayed treatments due to their inability to pay out-of-pocket expenses or insurance co-pays. For those without health insurance or Medicare coverage, a startling 81 percent say they forego treatments, as do 72 percent of poor Americans earning less than $40,000 per year. By 2010, medical bills were the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States, exceeding housing foreclosure as cause for limiting food, heat, and rent purchasing. Four million Americans declared bankruptcy that year, citing medical costs. A 2011 Department of Health and Human Services study found that the average American patient could only afford to cover 12 percent of their hospital bills, and that failure to gain full reimbursement on such bills accounted for $73 billion in losses for hospitals. A lack of access to affordable health care also has real health impacts in the United States. In 1950, the United States ranked number five in the world for female life expectancy; by 2009, it had fallen to number forty-six. A 2010 Commonwealth Fund comparison of population health in seven wealthy nations found the United States in last place. Between 1987 and 2006 the number of American women dying from pregnancy-related causes actually increased from 6.6 per 100,000 live births to 13.3 -- a doubling. In nearly all OECD countries, almost all of which have universal coverage, the reverse trend was seen, as ever-fewer women died year by year. Political pundits will now argue the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court decision and the likelihood that Republican opponents to the health reform law will be able to overturn it through legislation. But perhaps it will now be possible for an HIV-infected individual in Mississippi or Alabama to have access, at taxpayers' expense, to the same level of care as the U.S. government supports for comparable individuals in Johannesburg.

Doctors Feel Compassion Fatigue About Vaccine Refusers - The Atlantic,7235,"About the author: Chavi Karkowsky is a medical doctor in New York City and author of High Risk: Stories of Pregnancy, Birth, and the Unexpected. On social media, I’ve been seeing sentiments that I never thought I’d see anyone express in a public forum. People who choose to be unvaccinated should not be offered lung transplants. What if people with COVID-19 who didn’t get the vaccine have to wait in the Emergency Department until everyone else is seen? Should unvaccinated patients just be turned away? These are harsh, angry feelings. And some of the people giving voice to them are doctors. I am an obstetrician in New York. I have been working with pregnant COVID-19 patients from the very beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, in a medical institution and city that have cared for thousands of patients with the disease. Health-care workers have suffered through a terrible year and a half—a period first defined by a lack of masks and gloves, and throughout by the very real fear of personal sickness and death. We have been afraid of bringing the disease home, of infecting our spouses, of leaving our children parentless. For about three months, I didn’t kiss my children. Read: When keeping your distance is the best way to show you care Every day, my colleagues and I trudged past the temporary morgues in our hospital parking lots and the ICUs set up in the auditoriums and operating rooms and hallways; we signed too many death certificates; we washed our hands until they blistered before we let our families near us. We did that, every day, because we were trained to care for humans who needed us. A lot of us went to work every day because the world needs to keep turning, and in that time, we were the ones turning it. Many others left medicine. One reason I didn’t was that humans needed help and I could provide it. But I also kept working because I needed to believe that, if I was ever in danger, other humans would come help me. Our comparative advantage as humans is that we can take care of one another and overcome adversity together. I did my part week after week, month after month. Finally, in the depths of winter, during the week of my birthday, I received my first vaccine shot. Science had brought us a solution, and we could finally see the end of all those months of fear, exhaustion, and sacrifice. But that’s not what happened. COVID-19 hasn’t ended. Instead, infection rates are going up. The Delta variant has taken hold, and hospitals are filling up again. But this time the suffering seems different, because it is avoidable. Optional. A choice. The main reason the pandemic in the United States is not over is because people are not getting vaccinated. Some people may have good reasons for not getting a shot, but most people who refuse vaccination do not seem to be acting based on data or evidence. The refusals that we read every day seem more rooted in a general mistrust of government, or in a strong identity as “not that kind of people.” And those vaccine refusals mean people are getting sick, and will need care, and may die needlessly. This is a fact that many of us in health care—all exhausted, all having given too much already—are having a hard time ignoring as we head into a new wave of COVID-19 patients. Read: How did it come to this? When people make their personal decision about whether to get vaccinated, they are not thinking about the trauma their health-care providers have experienced since early last year. And I am not asking them to consider it. Professionalism mandates that physicians focus on the disease in front of them, not the behavior that may have contributed to it. When my colleagues diagnose chlamydia in a patient, their first priority is administering antibiotics, not delivering a lecture about asshole boyfriends. But once those antibiotics are prescribed, that same professionalism must include making sure that the patient knows how chlamydia is transmitted, and how to avoid ending up in this situation again. That person may or may not listen to a doctor, and that’s understandable. However, the population-level rejection of COVID-19 vaccines is a different phenomenon—and one that’s much more personally threatening to my colleagues and me. By refusing the most effective intervention, people are risking not only their own life but the lives of many around them. That includes those who cannot get vaccinated—my children among them. Because of the choice that vaccine refusers are making, my job may again force me to avoid embracing my children. “What makes me the maddest,” one of my doctor friends told me, “is that these people will reject science right until the second they need everything I have to keep them alive, and then they feel that they can come to our door and be entitled to that help and that hard work.” This friend is characterizing the inconsistency in the behavior she sees in people declining a vaccine but then demanding medical care based on the same science. That inconsistency feels, to her and to other dedicated medical professionals trying to survive this pandemic, very much like dishonesty. Unlike during the pre-vaccine phase of the pandemic, the current upsurge of suffering isn’t one that humanity has to go through. People are choosing it. And intent matters. Intent is the difference between a child who goes hungry because their parent can’t afford dinner and the one who goes hungry because their parent won’t buy them dinner. Having the ability to provide relief but not do so is cruel. To many medical providers working today, the rejection of lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines feels like a giant “Fuck you” from 29 percent of American adults. We will keep providing the best care possible, but they are making our job much harder. Read: My community refuses to get vaccinated. Now Delta is here. Not all health-care workers agree, of course. Plenty of hospital workers remain unvaccinated, and some have even staged protests against hospital-wide vaccine mandates. But most of us got vaccinated, and we’ll go to work tomorrow and the next day, no matter what. We will start IVs and give medicines and intubate patients no matter what bumper sticker is on their car. We are holding up our end of a bargain with society. But is society fulfilling its end? The pandemic has taken away so much: millions of jobs, more than a year of education for tens of millions of children, more than 600,000 American lives. Amid this new, largely preventable wave of infections, some health-care providers are losing something else: the belief that all of us can come together as a people to solve a problem. Doing the work of curing human bodies is harder when some of one’s faith in humanity is lost. What comes next? Future waves of COVID-19, probably; a widespread return to masking, perhaps; vaccine mandates in some limited settings, eventually. With time and common sense, the United States may get to a point at which infections subside. But it may not. I would argue that even if we do, Americans will have wasted time, energy, and lives. A year ago, we worried about dwindling N95-mask supplies and a limited ventilator inventory. Now we are burning through our most irreplaceable health-care resource: hope.","AUGUST 11, 2021"
Obama Goes on Offense on Healthcare - The Atlantic,3109,"Updated 3:04 p.m. President Obama has been so publicly introspective and abashed of late that it's easy to forget his history as an exceedingly good campaigner. He's a politician who can make a hell of a case when he wants to—which is what he's about to start doing on behalf of the Affordable Care Act. For weeks, the White House has been itching to fight back against Republican criticism of the president's signature achievement and what it sees as a GOP effort to harken back to an imaginary pre-Obamacare world of perfect insurance arrangements, where no one ever got dropped by a plan or excluded from coverage. Now that Healthcare.gov, the portal for purchasing insurance in 36 state exchanges, is largely functional, the White House wants to remind people what the bad old days looked like—and what they'd have to face if Republicans succeeded in repealing the Affordable Care Act or gutting its key provisions. The best way to defend Obamacare, the thinking goes, is to remind people of the alternative. Obama gave a base-rallying speech Tuesday at the White House in front of an enthusiastic audience to kick off a virtual advent calendar of daily healthcare-related messages touting the goodies in the ACA. ""If I've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works that's what I'll do,"" Obama vowed. ""We're not repealing it as long as I am president. We will make it work for all Americans."" The daily messaging push will continue until December 23, the deadline for people to enroll in insurance for January coverage. The Democratic National Committee is coordinating messages with a new website, thegophealthcareplan.com, that highlights a by-now-familiar contrast between the Democrats as the party of the future and the GOP as the party of the past. “The Republican healthcare plan for fixing the old broken healthcare system is to go back to the old broken healthcare system,"" said DNC spokesman Michael Czin. ""They want to put insurance companies back in the drivers’ seat over consumers care while Democrats are unified behind a desire to strengthen Obamacare and expand access to affordable healthcare.” Polling has shown the majority of Democrats and independent voters believe the ACA's problems can be fixed and do not support a repeal effort. Republicans think it's hopeless and unfixable, and just when Republican leaders start to step back from the repeal message they've hammered over and over during the past three years, voters push them to re-adopt the pro-repeal line. But Republicans have yet to coalesce around any alternative to the Affordable Care Act the way they did around its repeal and defunding, though they continue to lay out general principles. ""When you look at Obamacare which is a government-centered health care delivery system, that's not what the American people want,"" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters Tuesday. ""The American people want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance. They want to be able to pick their own doctor. They want to be able to pick their own hospital. That's what a patient-centered system looks like.""","DECEMBER 4, 2013"
"How We Spend $3,400,000,000,000 - The Atlantic",10218,"Last year, America’s total medical costs hit a new record of $3.4 trillion, according to the federal government. That’s about 18 percent of the country’s total GDP, meaning that one out of every six dollars we spent in 2016 went to health care. The national doctor bill dwarfs anything else we spend money on, including food, clothing, housing, or even our mighty military. If that $3.4 trillion were spread equally throughout the population, the bill would come to some $10,350 for every man, woman and child in the country. But fortunately—for most of us, anyway—the cost of health care is not equally distributed. Rather, a small number of Americans run up most of the expense. The biggest medical costs are concentrated on a fairly small segment of the population—people with one or more chronic illnesses, plus victims of accidents or violent crime. The cost is so concentrated, in fact, that an estimated five percent of the population accounts for 50 percent of total medical costs. For the purposes of this project, we’re calling these people The Platinum Patients—they’ve also been described as “super-utilizers” or “frequent fliers.” This concentration of total cost on a small segment of the total population is reflected in another common aspect of medical spending: the concentration of treatment, and cost, in the end of a life span. For most people, the vast majority of all the health care they’ll ever get comes near the hour of death. Hundreds of billions of dollars each year are spent treating Americans who are in the last weeks, or days, of life. The old Marx Brothers’ joke—“I wouldn’t dare go to the hospital—people die there all the time”—is essentially true. Many people die in the hospital—in many cases, just after they’ve incurred a hugely expensive round of surgery, treatment, and medication. About one-third of Americans undergo operations in the last month of life. If these issues were subject to hard, cold economic theory, a health-care system would probably distribute spending differently. The large sums it costs to keep a sedated cancer patient with dementia alive in a hospital bed from age 94 to 95 could presumably be directed instead to provide, say, a kidney transplant for a 40-something victim of renal failure, or a young woman who is too depressed to care for her baby. That money could be used for pre-natal care for uninsured mothers, setting the stage for both mother and child to have a healthier and happier life. Or, those funds could be used to provide health insurance at reasonable cost to the 29 million Americans who have no health coverage today. One famous, or perhaps notorious, advocate of limiting late-in-life medical spending is former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, who was given the nickname “Governor Gloom” in the 1980’s for his argument that the elderly have a “duty” to avoid costly care when the end is near. There’s only so much money available for medical care, Lamm noted, so it ought to be used in the most efficient way. In the face of bitter criticism, Lamm stuck to his guns. Just this spring he told the Denver Post: “When I look at the literature, and there are such things as $93,000 prostate operations at some stage of prostate cancer that might give two extra months of life, it is outrageous.” The problem with these straightforward economic calculations is that they involve real human beings who have friends and relatives. That 94-year-old cancer patient, after all, may have loving children or grandchildren at the bedside; hardly anybody is willing to let Grandpa die just to save money for the overall health-care system. The issue of allocating medical spending is most acute in the United States, because we spend far more on treatment and medication than any other country. All the other developed democracies on the planet guarantee health care for everybody (citizen or alien), and yet they spend, on average, about half as much per capita as the U.S. But all over the world, health systems are struggling with the same concentration of cost that plagues the U.S. So Britain created an organization to make rules for how its healthcare money is spent. It’s formally called the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, but everyone knows it by its acronym: “NICE.” This outfit issues guidelines to the regional medical authorities on what should be covered, and what shouldn’t. Should a 94-year-old get a hip replacement? Should a terminal cancer patient be given a course of medication that costs $40,000 and extends life an average of four months? (In Britain, the answers are, generally, “No.”) In one widely-reported case, the NICE guidelines said that a pub waitress—a mother of three—who contracted breast cancer should not receive the drug Herceptin. After all, NICE noted, the medication costs about $36,000, and doesn’t usually help with that woman’s particular form of cancer. Since there is only a finite amount of money in the National Health Service budget, the agency said, it would be smarter to spend those thousands on a treating another patient with a better chance of recovery. As pure economics, this made sense. As politics, it was a disaster. The waitress’s case became a national scandal. The tabloid headlines savaged the agency: “Not so NICE—Mum Left to Fight Cancer Without a Pill.” For systems that are looking for smarter ways to allocate limited funds, health-care economists have created a pair of measures to determine which treatments or drugs are worth paying for. The “Quality-Adjusted Life Year,” or QALY (pronounced “quolly”) and the “Disability-Adjusted Life Year, or DALY (“dolly”), are supposed to steer health-care dollars in the direction that provides the greatest quality of life. These ratings would say, for example, that spending money to keep an aging, asthmatic Alzheimer’s patient on life support for 9 months is not as useful as spending the same money for 9 months of pre-natal care for a poor, uninsured mother-to-be. Americans who are not health-care economists tend to resist the concept of QALYs and DALYs because they lead the system not to pay for one person’s health care in order to pay for another’s. This is considered “rationing” of health care, and rationing is generally condemned under a variety of names, most memorably as “death panels.” In fact, though, every nation rations health care every day. No country—not even the richest oil sheikdoms—can afford to pay for every advanced surgical procedure and every costly drug that modern medicine knows how to provide. Accordingly, health-care systems are constantly making choices—rationing—about which treatments to pay for. The United States, too, rations health care. Just ask any of the 29 million uninsured Americans who generally can’t see a doctor or pay for a prescription until they’re sick enough to go to the emergency room. But the U.S. does its rationing in a different way. In other rich countries, there’s a basic floor of care that everybody gets, which means there’s a ceiling as well—the system simply won’t pay for certain drugs or procedures. In the U.S., millions of people have no floor except the emergency room, and others have no ceiling. With the right insurance plan, there’s almost no limit to what money can buy in American health care, regardless of the age or condition of the patient. And so we continue to spend huge sums on that small, generally elderly segment of the population with chronic illnesses, while millions have no health insurance. One approach to this quandary that seems promising, both for the individual patient and for the health-care system overall, is the concept of “death with dignity,” as reflected in the Hospice movement. Hospice was initially a British idea that has spread to France, the U.S., and other advanced democracies. It’s a system that emphasizes caring, not curing, that replaces the all-out battle against death. In essence, the surgeries and the IV tubes and the breathing machines are replaced with a calm acceptance that one’s time is coming. A patient in Hospice avoids the operating room and the hospital ward, spending the final weeks or days of life at home or in a quiet facility, often with a regimen of drugs to control the pain of disease. In the U.S., most of the people who commit to Hospice are elderly, but it’s a path that terminally ill patients sometimes choose in their 20’s or 30’s. For the ailing individual, and for friends and relatives, it provides a more tranquil opportunity to reflect and say goodbye than the hurly-burly and confusion of a major hospital. For a health-care system, it can be a massive money-saver. Accordingly, the two big government health-insurance plans, Medicaid and Medicare, both provide payment for hospice services. One section of the Affordable Care Act (“ObamaCare”) says that physicians can now be paid for an office visit in which they discuss end-of-life options such as Hospice; this was the provision that Sarah Palin famously denounced as “death panels.” Still, most people facing serious illness avoid Hospice and place their bet instead on the marvels of modern medicine. The physical result is often positive; doctors today can cure diseases that were considered terminal just a few years ago. However, the fiscal impact of these miracle cures is increasingly painful for national treasuries. As other countries have found, there’s no simple solution to the problem of concentrated health-care costs. But one step that could clearly help in the U.S. would be a commitment, at long last, to provide health care for every American. All of the rich countries that guarantee health care for everybody have better health outcomes at much lower cost than the U.S. This is not a coincidence: a comprehensive system of universal care will always be cheaper and more effective than the haphazard, crazy-quilt network of overlapping and costly payment systems America is stuck with today. And when everybody is covered, the health-care system can probably make fairer decisions about where the money should be spent. If America is going to pay $3.4 trillion for health care, after all, we ought to make sure that every American benefits from that colossal expenditure.","JUNE 15, 2017"
Why I Oppose National Health Care - The Atlantic,9367,"I know, most of you have already figured out why I oppose national health care. In a nutshell, I hate the poor and want them to die so that all my rich friends can use their bodies as mulch for their diamond ranches.  But y'all keep asking, so here goes the longer explanation. Basically, for me, it all boils down to public choice theory.  Once we've got a comprehensive national health care plan, what are the government's incentives?  I think they're bad, for the same reason the TSA is bad.  I'm afraid that instead of Security Theater, we'll get Health Care Theater, where the government goes to elaborate lengths to convince us that we're getting the best possible health care, without actually providing it.
 That's not just verbal theatrics.  Agencies like Britain's NICE are a case in point.  As long as people don't know that there are cancer treatments they're not getting, they're happy.  Once they find out, satisfaction plunges.  But the reason that people in Britain know about things like herceptin for early stage breast cancer is a robust private market in the US that experiments with this sort of thing. So in the absence of a robust private US market, my assumption is that the government will focus on the apparent at the expense of the hard-to-measure.  Innovation benefits future constituents who aren't voting now.  Producing it is very expensive.  On the other hand, cutting costs pleases voters this instant.  This is, fundamentally, what cries to ""use the government's negotiating power"" with drug companies is about.  Advocates of such a policy spend a lot of time arguing about whether pharmaceutical companies do, or do not, spend too much on marketing.  This is besides the point.  The government is not going to price to some unknowable socially optimal amount of pharma market power.  It is going to price to what the voters want, which is to spend as little as possible right now. It's not that I think that private companies wouldn't like to cut innovation.  But in the presence of even rudimentary competition, they can't.  Monopolies are not innovative, whether they are public or private. Advocates of this policy have a number of rejoinders to this, notably that NIH funding is responsible for a lot of innovation.  This is true, but theoretical innovation is not the same thing as product innovation.  We tend to think of innovation as a matter of a mad scientist somewhere making a Brilliant Discovery!!! but in fact, innovation is more often a matter of small steps towards perfection.  Wal-Mart's revolution in supply chain management has been one of the most powerful factors influencing American productivity in recent decades.  Yes, it was enabled by the computer revolution--but computers, by themselves, did not give Wal-Mart the idea of treating trucks like mobile warehouses, much less the expertise to do it. In the case of pharma, what an NIH or academic researcher does is very, very different from what a pharma researcher does.  They are no more interchangeable than theoretical physicists and civil engineers.  An academic identifies targets.  A pharma researcher finds out whether those targets can be activated with a molecule.  Then he finds out whether that molecule can be made to reach the target.  Is it small enough to be orally dosed?  (Unless the disease you're after is fairly fatal, inability to orally dose is pretty much a drug-killer).  Can it be made reliably?  Can it be made cost-effectively?  Can you scale production?  It's not a viable drug if it takes one guy three weeks with a bunsen burner to knock out 3 doses. Once you've produced a drug, found out that it's active on your targets, and produced more than a few milligrams of the stuff, you have to put it into animals, then people.  Does your drug do anything in animal studies?  Does it do too much, like, say, killing the patient?  How about humans?  Oral dosing is just the start.  Does your drug actually get somewhere after it's swallowed, or do the stomach/liver chew it up?  Is there any way to wrap it in a protective package long enough to let it reach its target?  Do clinical trials show efficacy compared to placebo, or other drugs?  How big is the market (in other words, how many people want it, how badly, and how much of an improvement is your drug)? This is the stuff academic pharma doesn't do, and as you can see, without it, you don't have a drug; you have a theory.  What the NIH does is supremely valuable.  But so is all that ""useless"" effort at the pharmas. Now, maybe government institutions could be made to produce innovations; I certainly think it's worth trying Dean Baker's suggestion that we should let the government try to set up an alternate scheme for drug discovery.  Prizes also seem promising.  But I want to see them work first, not after we've permanently broken the system.  The one industry where the government is the sole buyer, defense, does not have an encouraging record of cost-effective, innovative procurement. At this juncture in the conversation, someone almost always breaks in and says, ""Why don't you tell that to an uninsured person?""  I have.  Specifically, I told it to me.  I was uninsured for more than two years after grad school, with an autoimmune disease and asthma.  I was, if anything, even more militant than I am now about government takeover of insurance. But you can also turn this around:  why don't you tell some person who has a terminal condition that sorry, we can't afford to find a cure for their disease?  There are no particularly happy choices here.  The way I look at it, one hundred percent of the population is going to die of something that we can't currently cure, but might in the future . . . plus the population of the rest of the world, plus every future generation.  If you worry about global warming, you should worry at least as hard about medical innovation. The other major reason that I am against national health care is the increasing license it gives elites to wrap their claws around every aspect of everyone's life.  Look at the uptick in stories on obesity in the context of health care reform.  Fat people are a problem!  They're killing themselves, and our budget!  We must stop them!  And what if people won't do it voluntarily?  Because let's face it, so far, they won't.    Making information, or fresh vegetables, available, hasn't worked--every intervention you can imagine on the voluntary front, and several involuntary ones, has already been tried either in supermarkets or public schools.  Americans are getting fat because they're eating fattening foods, and not exercising.  How far are we willing to go beyond calorie labelling on menus to get people to slim down? These aren't just a way to save on health care; they're a way to extend and expand the cultural hegemony of wealthy white elites.  No, seriously.  Living a fit, active life is correlated with being healthier.  But then, as an economist recently pointed out to me, so is being religious, being married, and living in a small town; how come we don't have any programs to promote these ""healthy lifestyles""?  When you listen to obesity experts, or health wonks, talk, their assertions boil down to the idea that overweight people are either too stupid to understand why they get fat, or have not yet been made sufficiently aware of society's disgust for their condition.  Yet this does not describe any of the overweight people I have ever known, including the construction workers and office clerks at Ground Zero.  All were very well aware that the burgers and fries they ate made them fat, and hitting the salad bar instead would probably help them lose weight.  They either didn't care, or felt powerless to control their hunger.  They were also very well aware that society thought they were disgusting, and many of them had internalized this message to the point of open despair.  What does another public campaign about overeating have to offer them, other than oozing condescension? Of course, the obese aren't the only troublesome bunch.  The elderly are also wasting a lot of our hard earned money with their stupid ""last six months"" end-of-life care.  Eliminating this waste is almost entirely the concern of men under 45 or 50, and women under 25.  On the other hand, that describes a lot of the healthcare bureaucracy, especially in public health. Once the government gets into the business of providing our health care, the government gets into the business of deciding whose life matters, and how much.  It gets into the business of deciding what we ""really"" want, where what we really want can never be a second chocolate eclair that might make us a size fourteen and raise the cost of treating us. I realize that to most people, these are airy-fairy considerations that should be overridden by the many ""practical"" considerations of the awesomenes of central health care.  Well, I'm actually pretty underwhelmed by that awesomeness, for reasons I'll happily elaborate elsewhere.  But not here, because fundamentally, to me, the effect on the tax code and the relative efficiency of various sorts of bureaucracy are mostly beside the point.  The real issue is the effect on future lives, and future freedom.  And in my opinion, they way in overwhelmingly on the side of stopping further government encroachments into health care provision.","JULY 29, 2009"
Will Healthcare Reform Help The Economy? - The Atlantic,4815,"After earlier dissecting Larry Summers' claim that the Obama administration is responsible for the economy's improvement, I wanted to address another assertion made in his recent letter (opens .pdf-like document) to Congress. He also outlines the path he believes the country needs to take for future economic prosperity. He says one of those steps is healthcare reform. Let's think about his logic. Here's what he says:

 

I don't pretend to be the foremost expert on healthcare, or the government's precise plans for reform. But I am pretty sure that the following assumptions are generally accepted in Washington, particularly by the Obama administration:

1. If left untouched, healthcare costs will increase.
2. Healthcare reform would reduce costs.
3. An explicit goal would be for the government to pay for healthcare for those who cannot afford private coverage.
4. Healthcare reform must be deficit-neutral, which means that taxes must be raised to pay for it.

Okay, now let's think about Summers' two assertions.

Reducing The Federal Debt

First, will healthcare reform convince markets that the long-term growth in Federal debt is under control? Let's imagine that markets weren't worried about runaway spending, just entitlement costs, like Medicare and the public healthcare option, if enacted.

No matter the precise numbers, for Summers' argument to make sense, Medicare savings would have to exceed the cost in covering health insurance for poor Americans. I find that incredibly hard to swallow. I know there is a lot of mathematical magic out there suggesting that new healthcare boards and other such measures will eventually reduce costs further, but the number of covered Americans on a public plan will also increase over time, which might neutralize any additional savings to Medicare. Making projections more than ten years out is a lot more art than science (as the Wall Street Journal notes in an editorial today).

Healthcare reform advocates would argue that this equation leaves out a variable: tax increases to help pay for the public option. Reform will be deficit-neutral. Sure, but you could similarly just raise taxes to better pay for Medicare cost increases without a public healthcare option. You could just make Medicare itself deficit-neutral through tax increases.

Here's another interesting wrinkle: if Americans have better healthcare, they should live longer. That means Social Security expenses -- another massive entitlement -- will also increase. This would add to the Federal debt, as Social Security is not self-sustainable, so any cost increase absent of an increase in taxes will increase U.S. debt. I'm not saying that the government should want people to die sooner, but helping them to live longer will increase entitlement costs going forward, and the debt.

Increasing Business Investment

Summers also claims that business investment will increase through healthcare reform. If I understand the argument here, individuals will be more inclined to embrace entrepreneurial activity if they don't need to rely on employer-based health benefits. That would increase investment.

Are there really people out there who would have started a business, but didn't, because they were worried about not having healthcare? And if so, are they so plentiful that they the businesses they would start if covered by a public option would cause a meaningful increase in investment? I haven't met any, but maybe I'm talking to the wrong people.

Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the administration's argument, and instead, the idea is that small businesses would have an easier time growing if they did not have to entice employees with healthcare benefits. That could be true, but I think that would mostly depend on how healthcare reform is paid for. According to a Wall Street Journal article from a few weeks ago, the House's proposal would tax even relatively small businesses if they did not offer healthcare:

 

If that was taken off the table, then perhaps it would help small businesses not to have to pay for healthcare. But another often talked-about source of new tax revenue might also hurt investment: raising taxes on the rich. The rich have a lot more money to invest than the poor, but if you tax them more in order to pay for healthcare reform, then the rich will have less money to invest. I would be stunned if that did not decrease business investment.

I think the moral argument is a lot more compelling for healthcare reform than the economic argument. If you believe healthcare is a natural right, then you can argue that based on philosophical rationale. If you believe it's an economic necessity, then you can attempt to argue that too. But first, you'll just need to come up with some better arguments than the two Summers relies on in his letter.","AUGUST 7, 2009"
"New Health Rankings: Of 17 Nations, U.S. Is Dead Last - The Atlantic",7316,"Will seeing just how far we've fallen behind other countries, across almost all measures of health, finally motivate change? We've known for years that Americans tend to be overweight and sedentary, and that our health care system, despite being the priciest in the world, produces some less-than-plum results. Health nerds who closely follow the news may even have known that we live shorter lives than people in other rich nations, and that infants in the U.S. die from various causes at far higher rates. But a fresh report, out Wednesday, tapped vast stores of data to compare the health of affluent nations and delivered a worrisome new message: Americans' health is even worse than we thought, ranking below 16 other developed nations. ""The news is that this is across the lifespan, and regardless of income,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, who was not an author of the study. ""A lot of people thought it was underserved populations that were driving the statistics -- the poor, the uninsured. They still are a big part of our challenge, but the fact that even if you're fairly well-to-do you still have these problems shatters that myth."" The question is: Will it make a difference? The report was prepared by a panel of doctors, epidemiologists, demographers, and other researchers charged by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine to better understand Americans' comparative health. They examined when and why people die in the U.S. and 16 other countries, including Australia, Japan, Canada, and nations in Western Europe. The data they pulled -- from such bodies as the World Health Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- already existed, but no one had yet examined it this comprehensively. The results surprised even the researchers. To their alarm, they said, they found a ""strikingly consistent and pervasive"" pattern of poorer health at all stages of life, from infancy to childhood to adolescence to young adulthood to middle and old age. Compared to people in other developed nations, Americans die far more often from injuries and homicides. We suffer more deaths from alcohol and other drugs, and endure some of the worst rates of heart disease, lung disease, obesity, and diabetes. These disproportionate deaths especially affect young people. For three decades, Americans, particularly men, have had either the lowest or near the lowest likelihood of surviving to age 50. The most powerful reasons found for that were homicide, car accidents, other kinds of accidents, non-communicable diseases, and perinatal problems like low birth weight and premature birth, which contribute to high infant mortality. Among the most striking of the report's findings are that, among the countries studied, the U.S. has: The report does reveal bright spots: Americans are more likely to survive cancer or stroke, and if we live to age 75 we're likely to keep on living longer than others. But these advances are dwarfed by the grave shortcomings. The authors took pains to counteract the possible assumption that U.S. numbers must be negatively skewed by poor and underserved populations. In fact, the report cites data suggesting that even white, well-off Americans live sicker and die sooner than similarly situated people elsewhere. In presenting their findings Wednesday, the authors seemed to be urging the U.S. to do some soul searching. Our culture ""cherishes independence"" and ""wants to limit the intrusion of government in our personal lives,"" said Steven Woolf, director of the Center for Human Needs at Virginia Commonwealth University, the panel chairman. While those values serve us in some ways, he said, our resistance to regulation ""may work against our ability to achieve optimal health outcomes."" The panelists' subtext: There's no turning a blind eye anymore, guys. We have to care. Co-author Paula Braveman, who directs the Center on Social Disparities in Health at University of California, San Francisco, said the panel grappled with this question as it searched for explanations for our poor health: ""Is it Americans' rugged individualism and the sense that the most important thing is the individual's freedom, and that's so much more important than doing what's right for society?"" Might our national M.O., in other words, be summed up as ""Live free and die""? Not that one factor is likely to be able to explain everything. The panelists identified a host of factors: More than other countries, our health care system is fragmented, unaffordable for many people, and short on primary care. Of the countries studied, we have the highest rate of children living in poverty. More of our communities are built around cars, which may discourage exercise. As individuals, the study found, ""Americans are less likely to smoke and may drink less heavily than their counterparts in peer countries, but they consume the most calories per capita, abuse more prescription and illicit drugs, are less likely to fasten seatbelts, have more traffic accidents involving alcohol, and own more firearms."" Yet even fit, nonsmoking Americans have higher disease rates than those elsewhere, the report said. The panelists' research uncovered no single cause, no rallying point for action, that accounts for the totality of our unhealthiness -- a complexity which makes the message harder to deliver and the solutions harder to achieve. Alternatively, Woolf said, it's conceivable that ""we are on the leading edge of a trend."" As other countries catch up to our obesity, and their legions of young smokers age, they could save us from last place. What do we do about all this? Yes, lots more research, to ferret out the effects of our current policies and what alternatives might work better, the panelists said. Meanwhile, they concluded that we already have enough evidence to act. Here's the rub. Reading through the panel's suggested solutions, it's impossible not to notice that a number of these involve public money and policy, and so would have to get through Congress. Many of the core recommendations read like the House Republicans' hit list: affordable health insurance for everyone, programs to encourage healthier behavior (read: nanny state), a stronger public safety net for people in poverty. There's even a hint of gun control. By late Wednesday, neither Congress nor the White House appeared to be springing into action over the report's revelations. Senator Tom Harkin, chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, said via a spokesperson that the existing Affordable Care Act ""addresses many of these primary causes"" of our health gap. New support for primary care, free cancer screenings, improved women's care, and other features of the law ""will all help address these disadvantages,"" he said. (The office of Rep. Jack Kingston, the new chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that covers health, didn't reply to my inquiry.) Braveman believes the best hope for the report is a wakeup call. ""The political obstacles are the huge ones,"" she said. ""My biggest hope is that this will shake people up and open people up to the evidence that's there from other countries."" This much, at least, could help: We don't like to lose to Europe.","JANUARY 11, 2013"
Our Unsustainable Culture of Medical Specialization - The Atlantic,5576,"Patients with multiple chronic diseases receive overall suboptimal care, and their disjointed treatment plans result in redundancies and inefficiencies that put disproportionate pressure on our health care system.  Morris MacMatzen/Reuters Adam Smith would have described our health care system not with his invisible hand, but with a pin-maker. In The Wealth of Nations, a parable about a pin-maker elucidates the benefits of division of labor: while a person working alone scarcely makes 20 pins in a day, a team of 10 that divides up shaping, sharpening, and painting pins can produce tens of thousands of pins per day. Workers become more efficient as they specialize by developing a skill, creating new technology to aid them, and not wasting time switching between tasks. Our medical system mirrors this 200-year-old model: just as each member of Smith's pin-making team masters discrete tasks, each doctor masters an organ system, surgery, or aspect of patient care. The cardiologist sees patients with heart problems, the psychiatrist depression, the oncologist cancer, and they all purportedly treat these respective diseases better than a single general physician. Over the past 30 years, economic pressures have forced even primary care, long the last bastion of the generalist, to split duties between full-time hospitalists and outpatient clinicians. As Smith would have predicted, these divisions of labor cure single diseases and manage routine care with the quality and efficiency. Yet, these benefits break down in the face of problems that cut across the divisions; namely, people with multiple chronic diseases. These patients, said to have multimorbidity, see a different specialist acting in isolation for each condition. Additionally, because clinical care guidelines and randomly controlled research trials typically focus on patients with only one disease to avoid confounding variables, specialists rarely know how treatment they administer interacts with other concurrent treatments. This fragmentation results in frequent adverse reactions to drug combinations, redundant or ineffective care, and overall poor health outcomes. Not only do multimorbid patients receive suboptimal care, but the unnecessary hospitalizations, redundant tests, and disjointed care they receive put disproportionate pressure on our health system. A 2010 report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation suggests that the 75 million Americans with multiple chronic ailments, a quarter of our population, account for 65 percent of all health expenditures. Patients with multiple chronic diseases are not an anomaly; they are quickly becoming the norm. Recently, a group of researchers in Scotland examined the healthcare usage of 1.7 million people -- nearly a third of the country. Their findings, published in The Lancet, suggest that 23 percent of Scottish people have multimorbidity, roughly the same percentage as in the United States, and that this percentage increases drastically as people age. By age 65, the average person has two or more chronic diseases, and people living in poverty reach this mark nearly 10 years earlier. As both the percentages of the population living in poverty and over 65 years of age continue to rise, handling patients with multiple chronic ailments will continue burden our health system. Unless something changes, this care will drive total healthcare costs out of control. The Affordable Care Act seeks to find solutions to curb the runaway spending and poor outcomes surrounding multimorbidity. Lost in the discussion over death panels and individual mandates, the ACA awards $1 billion to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to fund new models of payment and delivery of care that save money, improve health outcomes, and scale rapidly. More than 100 Healthcare Innovation Awards were bestowed in May and June, with 10 focusing on multimorbidity and dozens of others on related problems. Department of Health and Human services projections predict savings of nearly $2 billion over the next three years, with any successful projects being approved for replication across the country . One recipient, at the University of Chicago, aims to reduce cost for the most expensive and frequently hospitalized patients by undoing the division of labor in primary care. Led by Dr. David Meltzer, this project returns primary care physicians to splitting the day between the hospital and outpatient settings seeing a cadre of the highest risk patients -- primarily those with multiple chronic conditions. Both to make splitting time more feasible and to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, these ""comprehensive care physicians"" (CCP) will see 200 patients each instead of a typical load closer to 2000. During the half of the day in the hospital, the CCPs will attend to any of their hospitalized patients and help coordinate care between specialists. Additionally, Meltzer hypothesizes that many patients receive unnecessary care that lowers quality of life in their final days because a of breakdown in the doctor-patient relationship. By having a trusted doctor present in the hospital, the most vulnerable patients will receive superior care at a lower cost. Whether Meltzer's system provides a solution for effective and efficient care for multimorbidity remains to be seen. Between the 107 projects, some are bound to lead to systems that improve upon the status quo. By supporting challenges to the existing structures and providing incentives to scaling successful projects, the Affordable Care Act may earn its name.","JULY 31, 2012"
What If Healthcare Spending Doesn't Destroy America? - The Atlantic,3536,"One of my favorite lessons from Daniel Gilbert, the Harvard psychologist, is that the future is rarely as hellish or as heavenly as we imagine it to be. It's not an argument for ignoring future realities—savings are still crucial, global warming is still real—but rather a caution about overreacting to faraway fears when there is so much that deserves our attention today. ""If you can adapt surprisingly well to negative events,"" he said when I spoke with him in 2011, ""then you probably need less insurance than you're buying."" It's funny that Gilbert mentioned insurance at the time, because it is this week's health-insurance news that made me think about Gilbert's advice, again. Five years ago, with federal deficits soaring to record highs, it was easy to say that the future of U.S. healthcare would be hell. This view argued for dramatically restructuring the way the government spent money on medical care and other services. Projections shared by responsible economists said federal healthcare spending was on pace to gobble up half of the budget within a few decades—or $1 in every $10 of GDP by 2035. Some analysts said that if we wanted to preserve our future, our very way of life, it was necessary to make deep, painful, and brave cuts to benefits. It was a compelling argument. But five years later, we've relearned the lesson we seem to get whenever a team of experts unites around a prediction: Predictions are hard. New healthcare spending projections are out this week, and they tell a very different U.S. healthcare story. We're now projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars less on medical care that we thought in 2009. The Congressional Budget Office now says that healthcare costs will grow about 20 percent slower than they estimated just five years ago. The reasons why are myriad and hard to untangle. Some of the slowdown is Obamacare reforms and cuts to Medicare. Some of it is the recession, which suggests that the healthcare spending will ramp up again in the next few years. The expansion of high-deductible plans, states' efforts to control Medicaid spending, and fewer new technologies being introduced to hospitals—all of this could be playing a role. But the trend isn't uniquely American. Healthcare costs, which once ran rampant all over the developed world, are now slowing all over the developed world. It would be irresponsible to suggest that the 2014 projections are correct. They're just more recent, include more data, and therefore are more relevant to our thinking about the future. In five years, high-deductible plans could fall out of favor, Obamacare could be repealed, organ-printing machines could be shipped to every middle-class household, or avian flu could kill us all. But for now, the monster of healthcare inflation appears smaller than it once seemed. This isn't the end of healthcare spending projections and it's certainly not the closing bell on budget politics. Federal spending on Social Security and the major healthcare programs is still projected to double its historic share of the federal budget in a few decades. But the facts at the heart of the deficit hawks' doomsday case have changed dramatically in the blink of an eye. Scary budget projections call us to urgency without calling attention to the fact that their underlying assumptions could change fairly quickly. For now, the government should avoid spending too much of our present resources to avoid a future that might, in the Gilbertian sense, be much more easy to deal with than we imagine.","JULY 17, 2014"
5% of Americans Made Up 50% of U.S. Health Care Spending - The Atlantic,2017,"And the top 1%? They made up one fifth of medical expenditures.  Shutterstock / Scott Hales When it comes to America's spiraling health care costs, the country's problems begin with the 5%. In 2008 and 2009, 5% of Americans were responsible for nearly half of the country's medical spending.
 Of course, health care has its own 1% crisis. In 2009, the top 1% of patients accounted for 21.8% of expenditures. The figures are from a new study by the Department of Health and Human Services, which examined how different U.S. demographics contributed to medical costs. It looked at the $1.26 trillion spent by civilian, non-institutionalized Americans each year on health care. The top 5% of spenders paid an annual average of $35,829 in doctors' bills. By comparison, the bottom half paid an average $232 and made up about 3% of total costs. Aside from the fact that such a tiny fraction of the country was responsible for so much of our expenses, it also found that high spenders often repeated from year to year. Those chronically ill patients skewed white and old and were twice as likely to be on public health care as the general population. The graph below looks at how many people remained in each tranche of health care spending in both 2008 and 2009. One fifth of the top 1% of health care spenders in 2008 also were in the top 1% a year later. More than a third of those in the top 5% stayed there both years. According to this follow-up chart, elderly patients, aged 65 or older, made up 13.2% of the population in 2009. But they were 42.9 of the patients among the top 10% of spenders in both 2008 and 2009. Middle-aged Americans made up another 40.1% of that category. America's health care spending crisis is a concentrated phenomenon. The challenge isn't just about making everybody's insurance cheaper (although that would be nice). It's about figuring out how to cut costs, wisely and fairly, for the disastrously ill and preventing diseases before they become chronic. This is America's 5% problem.

Should the U.S. Health-Care System Be More Like the U.K.'s? - The Atlantic,2501,"On the U.K.’s National Health Service, every person is covered completely. There are no bills, deductibles, or co-pays. In fact, there are no insurance policies to speak of. The system is paid for by taxes, and the government controls the prices of drugs and the salaries of the doctors. “It’s like an unwritten constitution. There’s nothing to renew. It’s all there and it’s free,” said Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the U.K.’s Health Foundation, at Aspen Ideas: Health, which is co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic. There are some downsides to the NHS, Dixon noted. There’s an 18-week wait for an elective surgery, and it’s very difficult to find an NHS dentist. Still, the NHS spends much less per person than the American health-care system does, yet it achieves better outcomes, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Dixon, who was previously a policy adviser to the chief of the NHS, was speaking alongside Marit Tanke, who is the head of strategy and innovation at the Dutch health-insurance company VGZ . The two women spoke about the differences between the U.S. health-care system and that of their own countries. Though the Netherlands’ system is different—it’s not single-payer like the NHS—it, too, achieves near-universal coverage through close government regulation. At one point, Dixon and Tanke were asked by an audience member how each would change the U.S. health-care system if she were elected president. Dixon’s answer was especially striking. “It’s always dangerous to comment on someone else’s health-care system,” she said, but “price control is a critical one. The whole fee-for-service currency seems like the Wild West to us. That sets up horrendous incentives.” Dixon said she had traveled around the United States recently to try to understand why so many American adults—nearly 14 percent—are still uninsured. Her conclusion? “The social-justice thermostat in this country is set at a different level than it is in Europe. It’s set too cold. We need to dial it up.” Supporters of the current U.S. health-care system would likely argue that it is, in fact, social-justice oriented. It could be seen as compassionate, for example, to give patients the freedom to see specialists whenever they want, which the NHS does not allow. Nevertheless, Dixon’s comments set up an interesting thought experiment: that the reason the United States differs so dramatically from European countries on health care could be a matter of  psychology rather than policy.","JUNE 22, 2019"
The Decade-Long Slowdown in U.S. Healthcare Spending (in a Graph) - The Atlantic,1447,"There haven't been many happy stories to cut through the doom and gloom surrounding America's out-of-control, paycheck eating, budget-busting healthcare costs. But here's one of them, graphed by researchers at the Altarum Institute. Over the past decade, the growth of total U.S. medical spending has actually slowed by about half, falling from an annual rate of more than 8 percent in 2003 to 4 percent in 2012 (health spending growth in BLUE; overall economic growth in RED):  Does this mean we can stop worrying about the cost of Medicare 10 years or 20 years down the line? Sadly not. Remember, this is the tally of all private and public expenditures, and as more Americans age, their treatment needs will eventually swamp the federal budget. But -- as Annie Lowrey reported in the New York Times yesterday -- these numbers do suggest that doctors and insurers have at least begun to get a handle on expenses. While some of the slowdown can be credited to patients cutting back during the recession, the trend started before the economy fell apart and has lasted into the recovery. But here's a red flag: The rate hasn't dropped much in the last few years. Instead, it's stayed roughly even, ranging between 3.5 percent and 5 percent a year since 2010. So our out-of-control healthcare spending has gotten a bit less out of control. Think of it as a sign that our problems can be fixed, rather than one that they'll eventually fix themselves.","FEBRUARY 12, 2013"
Is Health Care a Human Right? - The Atlantic,3698,"Updated on June 26 at 12:11 p.m. ET. More than half the world’s countries have pledged to protect their citizens’ right to health care, through either national laws or international human-rights agreements. The United States is not one of them, although demands for universal health care and Medicare for All have been animating issues in the opening months of the 2020 presidential campaign. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, nearly 60 percent of Americans think it is the government’s obligation to guarantee health-care coverage. What it actually means to protect the health of a populace, though, can be less clear. “American Indians and Alaska natives are born with a legal right to health services, and that’s based on treaties in which the tribes exchanged land and natural resources for various social services,” Donald Warne, the associate dean of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of North Dakota, said while speaking on a panel at Aspen Ideas: Health, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic.* “Unfortunately, they’ve never been adequately resourced.” This type of underfunded mandate is a problem in countries that nominally support health care for all, such as Uganda, which the Ugandan human-rights lawyer Primah Kwagala says devotes few internal resources to population health. Speaking on the same panel, Kwagala said that official words and actions often don’t match up. “The right to health is looked at as more of an objective or aspiration for the government to provide health care for all,” she explained. “When you go to the hospital, you’ll find that basic things like blades are not there. The health worker is there, but their gloves are not there.” Much of Kwagala’s work hinges on holding the Ugandan government to account when a lack of supplies or staffing affects the health of patients. But in emerging democracies, the processes aren’t always in place to do so. Sometimes there aren’t even written laws. “The president promised verbally, but it’s not actually written in a policy anywhere,” Kwagala explained. “He just said, ‘For as long as I’m in power, health care is free.’” Lack of enforcement can be a problem in the U.S. too. In the detention centers at the southern border, human-rights organizations have reported numerous violations of the “safe and sanitary” conditions to which detainees are legally entitled. According to Helena Nygren-Krug, another panelist and a senior legal adviser for UNAIDS, promising health care isn’t enough to meaningfully safeguard the health of a country’s citizens. Not only do those promises have to be well funded, but governments need to address other determinants of health. “Can you cross the road safely? Is the air clean to breathe? Can you afford to buy healthy and nutritious food? Do you feel empowered to say no to unsafe sex?” Nygren-Krug said. “It’s really about the government respecting people’s basic human dignity and people’s rights.” Warne cautioned that the political will to enact those programs doesn’t exist in a vacuum. In America, he thinks a bigger obstacle than the popularity of a particular policy might be the acrimony and resentment that prevent people from seeing one another as united in a common struggle. “We have to take a look at some of the big differences, in terms of values and beliefs, as opposed to other countries that have been more successful with universal access,” he said. “We as a society aren’t there, and we aren’t going to have successful universal health care until we start caring about each other.” * This article previously misstated the university where Donald Warne works.","JUNE 24, 2019"
The Best Democratic Health Plan - The Atlantic,9291,"About the author: Matt Bruenig is the founder of People's Policy Project. Updated at 10:40 a.m. ET on August 9, 2019. With more than 20 people vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, it can be difficult to get a handle on the policy terrain. This is especially true in health care, where at least eight different plans are floating around, including from candidates whom few support, such as Michael Bennet, who wants to offer a public health plan in the small individual-insurance market. Among the candidates polling in the double digits, three have offered actual health-care proposals (as opposed to vague statements): Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders, whose Medicare for All plan is also supported by Elizabeth Warren. These plans are similar in the most general sense, in that they expand coverage and affordability, but they are dramatically different in their particulars and in what they tell voters about the respective candidates. To understand any of that, however, you have to understand how insurance works right now. Americans get insurance from four main sources. The first source is Medicare, which covers nearly all elderly people and some disabled people. The “core” program consists of Medicare Part A, which pays for hospital treatment, and Medicare Part B, which pays for doctor visits. Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs, but is administered only by private insurance providers. Private Medigap plans provide supplemental insurance for some of the cost-sharing required by Parts A and B, while private Medicare Advantage plans essentially bundle all of the above into a single offering. The second source is Medicaid, which covers low-income people and provides long-term care for disabled people. Medicaid is administered by states and jointly funded by state and federal governments. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder a bit, but some states did not go along with the expansion. The third source is employer-sponsored insurance, which covers about 159 million workers, spouses, and children. Employer insurance is very costly, with the average family premium running just under $19,000 a year. For average wage workers living in a family of four, this premium is equal to 26.4 percent of their total labor compensation. If you count this premium as taxes for international comparison purposes, the average wage worker in the United States has the second-highest tax rate in the developed world, behind the Netherlands. As with Medicaid, employer insurance is very unstable, with people losing their insurance plan every time they separate from their job (66 million workers every year) or when their employer decides to change insurance carriers (15 percent of employers every year). Read: The worst patients in the world The final source is individual insurance purchased directly from a private insurer. Most of the people who buy this kind of insurance do so through the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. The exchanges provide income-based subsidies to individuals with incomes from 100 percent to 400 percent of the poverty line, but have mostly been a policy train wreck: Enrollments were 50 percent lower than predicted, insurers have quit the exchanges in droves, and the income cutoffs have caused disgruntlement among low-income participants who would rather have Medicaid and high-income participants who get no subsidy at all. Despite all of this, or perhaps because of it, America still has about 30 million uninsured people, a number that is predicted to increase to 35 million by 2029. Conservative estimates suggest that there is one unnecessary death annually for every 830 uninsured people, meaning that America’s level of uninsurance leads to more than 35,000 unnecessary deaths every year. Biden has centered his candidacy on his association with Barack Obama. Given this strategy, it’s no surprise that he has put out a health plan that is meant to be as similar to Obamacare as possible. The plan keeps the current insurance regime intact while tweaking some of the rules to fix a few of the pain points identified above. He closes the hole created by some states not expanding Medicaid by enrolling everyone stuck in that hole into a new public health plan for free. He soothes the disgruntlement of high-income people who buy unsubsidized individual insurance by extending subsidies beyond 400 percent of the poverty line. And he slightly increases the subsidy amount for those buying subsidized individual insurance on the exchanges. In addition to these rule tweaks, Biden also says that the new public option for everyone in the Medicaid hole will also be available in the individual and employer insurance markets, meaning that people in those markets can buy into that public option rather than rely on private insurance. Biden is probably correct to say that his plan is the most similar to Obamacare. And just like Obamacare, Biden’s plan will leave a lot of Americans uninsured. Specifically, his own materials say that 3 percent of Americans will still be uninsured after his reforms, which means that about 10 million Americans will continue to lack insurance and about 12,000 will die each year due to uninsurance. Read: Why won’t Democrats blame hospitals? Sanders is running as a progressive democratic socialist who wants America to offer the kinds of benefits available in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway, or in even less left-wing countries such as Canada. Unlike Biden, he has no need or desire to wrap himself in the policies of the Obama era, and has instead come out in favor of a single-payer Medicare for All system. Under the Sanders plan, the federal government will provide comprehensive health insurance that covers nearly everything people associate with medical care, including prescription drugs, hearing, dental, and vision. Over the course of four years, every American will be transitioned to the new public health plan. Going forward, rather than getting money to providers through a mess of leaky insurance channels, all money will flow through the single Medicare channel, which will cover everyone. So far, Sanders has not adopted a specific set of “pay-fors” for his Medicare for All program, but has instead offered up lists of funding options. Although he has remained open on the specifics of funding Medicare for All, the overall Sanders vision is pretty clear: cut overall health spending while also redistributing health spending up the ladder so that the majority of families pay less for health care than they do now. And this plan is plausible: The right-wing Mercatus Center found in 2018 that the Sanders plan reduces overall health spending by $2 trillion in the first 10 years. The nonpartisan Rand Corporation has constructed a similar single-payer plan, with pay-fors, for New York State that would result in health-care savings for all family income-groups below 1,000 percent of the poverty line ($276,100 for a family of four). While Sanders’s support for Medicare for All helps promote his image as a supporter of universal social programs, Warren’s support for it helps boost her brand as a smart technocrat who understands good policy design. As Paul Krugman noted in 2007, a single-payer Medicare for All system is “simpler, easier to administer, and more efficient” than the “complicated, indirect” health-care system we have now. In general, single-payer systems are beloved by the wonk set because they are the most direct and cost-effective way to provide universal health insurance to a population. If Biden’s plan is Obamacare 2.0 and the Sanders/Warren plan is wonky universalism, then Harris’s plan is a bizarre and confusing muddle that also has come to typify her campaign. Harris is the candidate who went hard after Biden for his views on busing many decades ago and then clarified the next day that her views are the same as Biden’s. She’s the candidate who said she wanted to get rid of private insurers and raised her hand when asked if she would be willing to swap out private insurance for Medicare for All, only to walk back both statements the very next day. Harris’s health-care proposal, which is basically Medicare Advantage for All, is similar to the Sanders plan, except it takes 10 years to phase in instead of four and allows people to opt out of the public plan in favor of a private plan with identical coverage (similar to how Medicare Advantage works today). This weird hybrid allows Harris to insist that she is for Medicare for All while also saying that she is not getting rid of private insurance. As readers can probably guess, I favor the Sanders plan on the merits. But what matters for voters may not be the particulars, which most voters will probably never be aware of, but rather what the plans say about the candidates. Voters who want Obama 2.0 will see in Biden’s health-care plan a reassuring fidelity to his predecessor. Voters interested in universal social programs or technocratic wonkiness will have another reason to like Sanders or Warren based on their Medicare for All plan. And voters who like Harris’s style and do not care about consistency can use Harris’s triangulated health-care policy to see what they want in her.","AUGUST 8, 2019"
How Cubans Live as Long as Americans at a Tenth of the Cost - The Atlantic,6344,"On public-access TV in 1985, Bernie Sanders defended an element of Fidel Castro’s regime: It was rarely mentioned that Castro provided health care to his country. Sanders grumbled that the same could not be said of then-President Reagan. The comment came back to haunt Sanders in the wake of Castro’s death. On Sunday on ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz played the old clip and then asked Sanders if he was aware that “this was a brutal dictatorship despite the romanticized version that some Americans have of Cuba.” She reminded Sanders that Castro rationed food and punished dissidents, then hit him with the big question: “So have you changed your view of Castro since 1985?” Sanders said he didn’t exactly remember the context for his comment (being 31 years ago) but that Cubans “do have a decent health-care system.” Many consider it more than decent. After a visit to Havana in 2014, the director-general of the World Health Organization Margaret Chan called for other countries to follow Cuba’s example in health care. Years before, the World Health Organization’s ranking of countries with “the fairest mechanism for health-system finance” put Cuba first among Latin American and Caribbean countries (and far ahead of the United States). Cuba has long had a nearly identical life expectancy to the United States, despite widespread poverty. The humanitarian-physician Paul Farmer notes in his book Pathologies of Power that there’s a saying in Cuba: “We live like poor people, but we die like rich people.” Farmer also notes that the rate of infant mortality in Cuba has been lower than in the Boston neighborhood of his own prestigious hospital, Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s. All of this despite Cuba spending just $813 per person annually on health care compared with America’s $9,403. In Cuba, health care is protected under the constitution as a fundamental human right. As a poor country, Cuba can’t afford to equivocate and waste money upholding that. This pressure seems to have created efficiency. Instead of pouring money into advanced medical technology, the system is forced to keep people healthy. It’s largely done, as the BBC has reported, through an innovative approach to primary care. Family doctors work in clinics and care for everyone in the surrounding neighborhood. At least once a year, the doctor knocks on your front door (or elsewhere, if you prefer) for a check-up. More than the standard American ritual of listening to your heart and lungs and asking if you’ve noticed any blood coming out of you abnormally, these check-ups involve extensive questions about jobs and social lives and environment—information that’s aided by being right there in a person’s home. Then the doctors put patients into risk categories and determine how often they need to be seen in the future. Unlike the often fragmented U.S. system where people bounce around between specialists and hospitals, Cuba fosters a holistic approach centered around on a relationship with a primary-care physician. Taxpayer investment in education about smoking, eating, and exercising comes directly from these family doctors—who people trust, and who can tailor recommendations. The system requires around twice as many primary-care doctors per capita as we have in the U.S., made possible because the country also invested in medical education, creating in 1998 what U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called “the world’s most advanced medical school.” Cuba has become known for training not just domestic doctors, but those from around the world—and sending its doctors to help other, wealthier countries when needed. During the recent Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, more than 100 Cuban doctors and nurses were at the front lines. Castro justified sending so much support with a brutally holistic understanding of disease as a global phenomenon. He wrote at the time: “By completing this task with maximum planning and efficiency, our people and sister peoples of the Caribbean and Latin America will be protected, preventing expansion of the epidemic, which has unfortunately already been introduced, and could spread, in the United States, which maintains many personal ties and interactions with the rest of the world.” That spirit also underlies Cuba’s vaccination program, implemented in 1962, which has left the country with some of the world’s lowest rates of vaccine-preventable infectious disease. The much wealthier U.S. also has vaccines and primary-care check-ups, of course. The key difference is that in Cuba, these things are mandatory. They’re seen as akin to doing routine maintenance on a car to keep the warranty valid. If the system is going to take care of people in dire situations, people must also let the system take care of them before those dire situations occur. This is the opposite of the U.S., where people demand the former but forego the latter. There are costly barriers to primary care and preventive medicine, but showing up at an emergency room is easy. While Cuba’s situation is far from ideal, it serves as an elegant counterpoint to the three-trillion-dollar U.S. health-care system—which is controlled by corporations (privatized insurance, pharmaceutical, medical-device, and hospital systems) that drive people to pay exorbitant costs (either directly or through taxes). Cuba offers a dire reminder that efficient health care can be provided at much less cost to the people—when the focus is on primary care and prevention. As  Salim Lamrani of Paris-Sorbonne University put it, excellent health care can exist in the absence of wealth “if political will exists to put human beings at the center of the project.” In that light, Sanders’s comments were valid, then and now. After defending Cuban health care on the ABC show on Sunday, he continued, “the Cuban economy is a disaster.” And then, unequivocally, he added: “No, I do not praise Fidel Castro.” This exchange highlighted a fundamental barrier to progress in health care. Do you praise Fidel Castro? If you had to answer yes or no, the answer is no. But good and bad co-exist here, as everywhere. The first step is overcoming the human tendency toward ‘all-good’-or-‘all-bad’ dualism. It can be true that Castro did horrible things, and that Cuba’s health-care system is lacking in many ways, and also that there’s much to learn from it.","NOVEMBER 29, 2016"
The Infuriating Lottery of Healthcare Prices - The Atlantic,1885,"One popular strain of healthcare article considers how a common medical procedure costs X in the United States and Y in Germany (or Japan or France or Brazil), with the foreign figure being tantalizingly low by comparison. The explanation is usually that Germany (or wherever) caps how much providers and drug-makers can charge, and the U.S. does not. The U.S. might be expensive when it comes to healthcare prices, but it's far from monolithic. While someone in Stuttgart might pay as much as their cousin in Hamburg for an x-ray, the same cannot necessarily be said of two people in, say, Madison and Milwaukee. A new report out from the Health Care Cost Institute shows that the price of a given procedure can vary widely within a single state. In Wisconsin, for instance, how much people pay out-of-pocket for cataract-removal surgery has a range of $989. In each of nine states that the nonprofit examined, out-of-pocket charges for other common, elective procedures varied by hundreds of dollars. Keep in mind that these are out-of-pocket charges—that is, what people actually paid. The discounts providers give to various insurance plans don't apply to this data. The fact that there is so much variation in out-of-pocket costs suggests that doctors and hospitals often charge wildly different amounts. HCCI also found that co-pays are on the rise: Nationally, out-of-pocket medical spending among adults who had job-based insurance rose 6.9 percent, from $662 per person in 2012 to $707 in 2013. The HCCI study authors suggest that to save money, consumers should shop around before they settle on a doctor for a big operation or diagnostic test. Most insurers (and some states) offer ways for people to look up their expected costs for various procedures. That might not be possible in an emergency situation, though, which is exactly when someone might need, say, a knee MRI.","FEBRUARY 3, 2015"
Who Is Taking Care of Hospital Workers’ Children? - The Atlantic,9802,"When Ellen Lubbers first decided to try to help the doctors and nurses of Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center line up child care for their kids, whose schools had suddenly closed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, she didn’t realize just how much help they actually needed. On March 14, Lubbers, a 30-year-old third-year OSU medical student, saw a small commotion sparked by a tweet from one of her classmates: Because clinical rotations had been canceled, the classmate had offered her services as a babysitter to any doctor or nurse. Other students immediately jumped in with similar offers, and Lubbers wondered if one central, shareable document might be more helpful than a disjointed smattering of tweets. Lubbers set up a Google Doc, where, with permission, she listed the contact information of other interested students. “I sent the link to one person, a clinician who’s a mom,” Lubbers told me. “I said, ‘If you think this would be helpful to anybody, please share it.’” Within hours, some of the first students who had signed up were sending panicked emails to Lubbers: They had been swamped, already, with more requests from health-care workers than they could handle. As COVID-19 cases multiply all over the United States, the influx of new hospital patients has put a strain on medical centers’ resources—of both the material variety and the human. In New York State, where it’s estimated that nearly half of America’s confirmed coronavirus cases are located, hospital staffs are spread so thin that Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have called on retired doctors and nurses to form a “medical reserve” force. Many if not most primary-care physicians and hospital staffers are at work much more than usual, and some are even living apart from their families to protect them from exposure. Meanwhile, the infrastructure that usually provides care for their kids (schools and day cares) have mostly closed. As a result, many health-care workers are facing an impossible choice between caring for victims of a pandemic and caring for their own children at home. Other people whose job or education has been put on hold by the pandemic have rushed to fill the vacuum and help these parents get the assistance they need—but even that presents a number of challenges. After Lubbers’s Google Doc proved to be an unsustainable system, she created an online form, where health-care workers who needed help and students willing to babysit could enter info about themselves into a database—where they lived, what hours they needed assistance or were available, what kind of assistance they needed or could provide. Lubbers included “petsitting” and “errands” as categories of available aid, but “really, people just needed child care,” she said. “Of the 90-some requests we fielded, there were, like, three for other services.” The form went online on the afternoon of March 15, and it, too, was inundated by the next morning. Lubbers and another medical student got to work matching health-care workers with willing students; Lubbers said she was emailing, calling, and texting people for the next 13 hours straight. Making her job harder was the fact that a lot of health-care personnel needed child care right that minute: “A lot of in-home day cares were electively closing at that point,” she told me, “and it was really frustrating for providers that some of their normal babysitters and normal nannies were not willing anymore to watch their kids, because they’re kids of doctors who are going to go to a hospital,” and thus their household was at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. The form was closed a few days later, when the OSU medical center stepped in and offered to help match students with employees using the app Juggle. But before it closed, about 100 students had signed up to provide help, 91 parents had signed up to receive it, and 61 matches been arranged. OSU’s grassroots effort isn’t the only one of its kind; similar ad hoc babysitting networks have sprung up at Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Minnesota, among other places. As of Monday, the group that has grown out of the University of Minnesota—known as MN CovidSitters—had approximately 300 volunteers, many (but not all) of whom are med-school or nursing students. MN CovidSitters, like OSU’s network, also offers pet care and errand-running, but has primarily been tasked with coordinating child care; unlike OSU’s network, in which parents and their sitters or helpers can negotiate pay individually, MN CovidSitters provides all services for free. The group is looking to expand to meet the needs of health-care workers statewide, and recently partnered with Clinician Nexus, an app often used by medical schools to manage students’ clinical rotations, to match families with volunteers. It has also begun accepting volunteer applications from any university students currently located in Minnesota, as long as they submit to a background check and are fully up-to-date on immunizations; applicants who are CPR-certified are strongly preferred. Lubbers and student organizers from MN CovidSitters told me that the response from doctors has been positive overall. “We’ve gotten many letters of gratitude from our professors and mentors,”  said Sara Lederman, a 30-year-old second-year medical student and one of MN CovidSitters’ founders. Lubbers noted that having their kids cared for by a health-care student seemed to put a lot of health-care workers’ minds at ease. “There are a lot of doors you have to go through to become a medical student or nursing student,” she said, “and they knew a medical [or nursing] student would be vaccinated and have had a background check.” Lederman also acknowledged, however, that there are risks to this kind of solution—risks that may have hindered some schools from getting similar efforts off the ground (or so she’d heard). “I think there’s a lot of concern around infection and around liability issues,” she said. Indeed, one challenge inherent to any kind of child care at this moment is that it necessarily involves people coming and going into other people’s homes—which directly contradicts the best practices of social distancing. And when the kids who need looking after live with a health-care worker, one of the homes in the equation is automatically at a higher risk of coronavirus exposure. Read: The do’s and don’ts of social distancing Lubbers and her OSU classmates adopted a one-to-one student-to-family system to minimize exposure, but it quickly became clear that students’ available time was insufficient to meet families’ child-care needs. MN CovidSitters, by contrast, has been using what it calls a “pod model,” whereby three or four students are assigned to one family and encouraged to limit their exposure to anyone else—an approach that trades minimizing exposure for maximizing coverage. Last week, during spring break, Jacob Walling, a 23-year-old first-year University of Minnesota medical student, was able to spend some 19 hours over the course of two days caring for a pair of school-age kids whose single mom is a health-care worker. This week, class is back in session, and “I still have four hours of lectures to go through today online,” he told me on Monday—so other students will take over for him, and he’ll resume child-care duties next week. Both approaches meet the goal of providing child care to workers who desperately need it, but neither perfectly meets health-care workers’ needs while also perfectly complying with social-distancing guidelines. There may not be a system that can do both. These networks don’t address all of health workers’ needs. Some also need help caring for their elderly parents or relatives—who are part of a population that’s both especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and whose care often requires specific training. Jade Cohen, 28, a second-year medical student and MN CovidSitters’ volunteer-coordination director, told me that the group had recently put a notice on its intake form telling families that the student volunteers weren’t qualified to care for elderly patients. (There are some resources available to help meet this need. Care.com, for instance, is offering free three-month premium memberships for medical workers.) But these improvised care networks are far better than nothing, and they are threatened by the possibility of full lockdown protocols, and the coronavirus itself. The state of Ohio has been under a stay-at-home order since March 23, but it includes an exception for “taking care of others”; the governor of Minnesota announced today that a similar order (with a similar exception) will take effect at midnight on Friday. Still, organizers like Sara Lederman are thinking ahead to the possibility of stricter orders. “As soon as they say ‘You cannot leave your house ever, not even to support health-care workers,’ we will respect that,” Lederman told me. And then health-care workers with children will be utterly without support. Organizers also have to think ahead to what would happen if and when the disease spreads further. “We have each volunteer track their hours and contact with each family so that we can easily trace where they have been in any window of possible infection,” Lederman told me. If someone in a “pod” starts having symptoms of or tests positive for COVID-19, “we automatically pause the service, and we ask that whoever was in contact with that family self-quarantines for 14 days.” The networks that have sprung up to care for the families of caregivers are poignant expressions of community members’ commitments to one another—but they’re also fragile. They’re just as susceptible to disease, and just as much at the mercy of the unknown future, as the humans who built them.","MARCH 27, 2020"
Why Many Latinos Dread Going to the Doctor - The Atlantic,11364,"Recent studies have found that Latinos are the racial and ethnic group least likely to visit the doctor. More than one-fourth of Latino adults in the United States lack a usual healthcare provider and almost half of Latinos never visit a medical professional during the course of the year. Other reports show that Latinos are more likely than members of other groups to delay healthcare for an illness or drop out of treatment when symptoms disappear. Meanwhile, Latinos in some states were reluctant to sign up for the Obamacare exchanges. With Latinos accounting for one-third of the uninsured in the country, healthcare advocates have puzzled over why Latinos seem hesitant to seek healthcare. There are the obvious obstacles: Around one quarter of Latino adults in the U.S. are undocumented, making them unable to qualify for Medicaid or other government benefits. Even with President Obama emphasizing that information provided when applying for Obamacare would not be transferred to immigration services, the 5.5 million American-born children of undocumented parents may find their families avoiding Obamacare sign-ups out of fear of exposing their status. A language barrier also discourages some Latinos from asking for help, or from understanding the healthcare information available. And for the many Latinos working low-wage jobs or who are self-employed, employment status disqualifies them from public health programs while still not providing enough income for them to afford quality care. These significant barriers partially explain Latino healthcare disparities, but they don’t tell the complete story. As a Latina growing up in a middle-class immigrant Mexican and Ecuadorian family, I saw Latinos who had the privilege of steady income, education, and familiarity with the English language still feel hesitant about receiving healthcare. My brother, who works at a company that doesn’t provide him with health insurance, has gone seven years without seeing a doctor. One friend’s mother, who holds a Ph.D. and has lived in the United States for more than 30 years, still needed her daughter’s urging to visit a doctor and discuss her lengthy battle with depression. Even I have hesitated to apply for health insurance during my time working as a freelance writer. I have spent the past 15 months without it. A Pew Hispanic Center study found that half of the Latinos who did not seek medical care had a high-school education, a third were American-born, and 45 percent had health insurance. This suggests that the Latino apprehension about healthcare goes deeper than issues of access. It also partially derives from a long history of preferring non-Western medicine, a cultural uneasiness with the American style of healthcare, and a tradition of privacy and individual pride that makes many Latinos believe we have no need to ask for help. A 2013 Colorado survey found that 45 percent of Latinos rely on home remedies to avoid medical costs. A 2012 Census Bureau report also found that 72 percent of Hispanics never use prescription drugs. Latinos—particularly those from indigenous backgrounds—have an established history of using natural medicine. When I recently visited the town of Rio Blanco, Ecuador, in the Amazonas region of the country, our local guide showed us plants his community used for every health issue imaginable: stomachaches, headaches, muscle pain, anxiety—even birth control and abortion. While visiting Peru, I observed how locals treated common ailments like altitude sickness with a tea made of coca leaves, in place of Western medications like Diamox. And in Ecuador, I observed my aunt’s housekeeper using oregano tea to help with menstrual cramps. These traditions still hold strong in many parts of Latin America today, providing many Latinos with a family custom of treating yourself without a professional doctor’s help. My Mexican grandmother owned a natural health store for years, and she’d make her own medicine from herbal ingredients that we’d use whenever we got sick. We also used other natural methods, like curing colds with orange juice and Echinacea pills and digestive issues with papaya. To this day, I have never used Nyquil, Pepto-Bismol, Aleve, or many other popular American products. Even as an adult, I still hesitate to take any American medication without first asking my family for traditional alternatives. These natural medicines can be risky and ineffective, but regardless, Latinos often feel more comfortable using them. As a result, many Latinos have created a network of alternative health practitioners that we often trust more than Western doctors. “There’s greater trust for what has worked for your family or what you’ve heard has worked for others in your community. So then, when Latinos have a health concern, many may think ‘Oh well, my Tia told me about this tea you can drink … ’ and that replaces Western medical advice,” says Marisa Salcines, the co-founder of Healthyhispanicliving.com, a website that aims to develop culturally relevant health content for the Latino community. Latinos’ trust in Western healthcare diminishes even more when doctors don’t approach Latino patients in the way they expect. For many Latinos, a doctor-patient relationship needs to feel personal, welcoming, and concerned for the individual as a whole. This makes the American healthcare setting, in which doctors often rush visits and lack time to establish relationships with patients, seem untrustworthy. “Most American healthcare deals with a kind of factory approach where you’re in and out and that’s that,” says Salcines. “But for Latinos, we value having a relationship with our doctors.” A 2008 study that interviewed 28 Latinas about their experiences with American healthcare supported this claim. One interviewee, explaining her recent visit with a doctor, said, “I didn’t feel comfortable with him, the meeting was too short and fast … he didn’t pay attention to what I was saying, he didn’t ask me my name, and he didn’t introduce himself. He went directly to check me. It was the most uncomfortable situation.” Twenty-six of the women said the amount of information they disclosed to their doctor depended on “developing a trusting relationship with their physician based on mutual respect.” The researchers wrote that, “for these women, their willingness to disclose information decreased if they did not sense that their physician was compassionate.” I relate to these women’s concerns. I’ve never felt quite comfortable with most doctors’ styles, and I often leave visits frustrated that the doctor asked little about me, prescribed medication quickly, and didn’t bother getting to know more about my situation as a whole. I always mentally compare these experiences to the comfort and familiarity of my grandmother’s remedies. As a generally-healthy young adult, this is one of the reasons I feel unmotivated to apply for healthcare. Discomfort with doctors also intensifies when the health topic is culturally taboo, like sexual health or mental illness. Latino males are almost 2.5 times more likely than whites to have HIV and Latina females are five times more likely than whites to experience teen pregnancy. Yet stigma around the subject prevents patients from talking about it. In the 2008 study of Latina women, interviewees said their culture “regarded sex as a personal, intimate issue to be discussed only with one’s partner and sometimes not even then.” During my visits with gynecologists, I am always surprised by how openly doctors expect me to discuss issues I’ve been raised to believe are private. For mental health, reactions are similar. A 2001 Surgeon General's report found that only 10 percent of Latinos with a psychological disorder contact a mental health specialist. Often this is because Latinos aren’t familiar with mental health issues, nor comfortable talking about them. Some members of my family don’t know what “anxiety disorder” or “depression” truly mean. Instead, they often simply say that a family member is “not right” or “not well,” and consider it a phase that will pass with individual effort. When healthcare professionals don’t share our same background, we are even less comfortable asking for help. Latinos represent more than 16 percent of the population, yet only 5 percent of physicians. In 2011, only 15 percent of students entering medical school were black or Latino. In heavily Hispanic states like California, Texas, and New Mexico, this gap becomes even more significant. Our cultural emphasis on trust makes having a doctor we can relate to even more crucial. Salcines recalled how her Cuban mother would wait five hours in a waiting room to see a Latino doctor, rather than visit a non-Hispanic physician: “There’s a level of confianza or trust that you feel with someone Hispanic. It just gives you an instant feeling of, ‘Okay, I can tell this person what I really feel.’” With all these cultural influences involved, when medical care is not reasonably priced, even middle-class Latinos will feel disinclined to pursue it. My own middle-class family often weighed the necessity of visiting doctors against the money we’d save by staying at home. The frustrating result from all this is that many Latinos may not receive the care they actually need. A third of Latinos have diabetes, and as many as half are not aware of how to treat it. According to the FDA, Latinos have worse diabetes control than other groups and are more likely to experience complications from the disease. Even among the generally healthy, not addressing Latinos’ attitudes toward healthcare puts our demographic at a disadvantage. Without visiting doctors, we are not accessing information that could change our daily health decisions or getting the preventative care we need. Healthcare workers can address these issues by offering their services on a sliding scale and translating health information into Spanish. But healthcare professionals also need to be aware of the cultural values that Latino patients find significant. They need to focus on building relationships with patients and understanding their background, as well as emphasizing health education programs in Latino communities. Having more Latino doctors would also help alleviate these concerns. Reports suggest that once Latino and black students become doctors, they are more willing than other groups to practice in underserved areas. But in pre-med programs, many Latino students often lack the prerequisite courses to succeed, like Advanced Placement Chemistry and Biology. They also often lack mentors to help navigate the medical-school application process. And the staggering price of medical school can make this career choice seem daunting. Providing more support for Latino students facing these challenges would ultimately allow them to contribute their essential background knowledge to the medical field. The diversity within the Latino community means that addressing their healthcare issues is going to take more than a few, simple solutions. If healthcare providers want to attract the more than 50 million Latinos who live in the United States, they need to commit to learning about our diverse community and its multifaceted culture. They can start by recruiting Latino professionals who can provide personal insight about how to help them best.","MAY 7, 2014"
The Inherent Inequality of Health Care for Women - The Atlantic,1899,"The political debate that has been occupying much of our time over the past several weeks -- that of Obama's health care plan granting free access to birth control for women -- fails to take into account a deeper problem at stake, which is an inherent gender inequality with regard to health care. When Rush Limbaugh, for instance, talks so charmingly about how he shouldn't have to pay for someone to have sex (and that if he does, he wants a sex tape in return), a statement then echoed by other more seemingly functional members of society, he fails in two ways. Along with a failure to understand how birth control works in the first place, he's also failing to acknowledge that a gender gap already exists with regard to health care. Robert Pear, writing in The New York Times, explains, ""Women still pay more than men for the same health insurance coverage, according to new research and data from online brokers."" Though Obama's Affordable Care Act, signed on March 23, 2010, will ban gender rating starting in 2014, the gender gap currently exists ""in most states,"" leading to inequalities, often highly variable, like the following: Disconcertingly, ""more than 90 percent of the best-selling health plans charge women more than men"" in states that haven't banned gender rating (14 states, including California, New Jersey, and New York, have moved to limit or get rid of gender rating in the individual insurance market), writes Pear. Civil rights laws have prevented employers offering group benefit plans from charging higher premiums to women than men for the same benefits. But in the individual insurance market, that has not happened. Why has gender rating been considered acceptable in the first place? According to insurers, women use health care more and ""are more likely to visit doctors, to get regular checkups, to take prescription drugs and to have certain chronic illnesses.""","MARCH 19, 2012"
"Even With Insurance, Americans Can't Afford Their Medical Bills - The Atlantic",29420,"A chance trip to Long Island’s Adventureland amusement park just might have saved Cassidy McCarthy’s life. After Cassidy—whose family calls her Cassie—then 4, complained about pain and nausea following a ride on the Ladybug rollercoaster, her dad, Daniel, a registered nurse, felt her stomach and discovered a small bump. A CT scan ordered up at a local hospital’s emergency room revealed a kidney tumor. It was another seemingly chance decision by Daniel McCarthy to sign on as a volunteer firefighter more than a decade ago that saved the family’s finances in the wake of Cassidy’s diagnosis with cancer. As it turned out, that activity allowed him to ask The Heather Pendergast Fund, a foundation set up in 2009 to help out the families of Long Island’s volunteer firefighters and EMS workers with their children’s medical expenses, to pay many of Cassidy’s medical bills. McCarthy says the charitable foundation was a financial lifeline. Cassidy quickly racked up more than several thousand dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses—for the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, radiologists, chemotherapy, you name it—since the family’s insurance policy had a $6,000 deductible. A few months later, Pendergast came through again when McCarthy lost his job at a local nursing home and rehabilitative center and the family suddenly had to find money for COBRA payments, which, at $2,100 a month, were more than the monthly mortgage payment on their West Babylon, Long Island, home. “I don’t know how people who don’t have resources do this. I don’t. Many people work three, four jobs, and can’t afford the time to volunteer in an organization like the fire department that would be able to help them. There are many people living out there that need help that can’t find it,” McCarthy says. The current debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act is obscuring a more pedestrian reality. Just because a person is insured, it doesn’t mean he or she can actually afford their doctor, hospital, pharmaceutical, and other medical bills. The point of insurance is to protect patients’ finances from the costs of everything from hospitalizations to prescription drugs, but out-of-pocket spending for people even with employer-provided health insurance has increased by more than 50 percent since 2010, according to human resources consultant Aon Hewitt. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that in 2016, half of all insurance policy-holders faced a deductible, the amount people need to pay on their own before their insurance kicks in, of at least $1,000. For people who buy their insurance via one of the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges, that figure will be higher still: Almost 90 percent have deductibles of $1,300 for an individual or $2,600 for a family. Even a gold-plated insurance plan with a low deductible and generous reimbursements often has its holes. Many people have separate—and often hard-to-understand—in-network and out-of-network deductibles, or lack out-of-network coverage altogether.  Expensive pharmaceuticals are increasingly likely to require a significantly higher co-pay or not be covered at all. While many plans cap out-of-pocket spending, that cap can often be quite high—in 2017, it’s $14,300 for a family plan purchased on the ACA exchanges, for example. Depending on the plan, medical care received from a provider not participating in a particular insurer’s network might not count toward any deductible or cap at all. At the same time, the most recent Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, an annual survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, found that 44 percent of adult Americans claim they could not come up with $400 in an emergency without turning to credit cards, family and friends, or selling off possessions. When this reality combines with healthcare bills, the consequences can be financially devastating.  A 2015 poll by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health discovered that 26 percent of those who took part in the survey claimed medical bills caused severe damage to their household’s bottom line. A poll conducted earlier this year by Amino, a healthcare-transparency company, with Ipsos Public Affairs, found that 55 percent of those they surveyed claimed they had at least once received a medical bill they could not afford. No surprise, then, that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported earlier this year that medical debt was the most common reason for someone to be contacted by a debt collector. This spending is most pressing for households with the highest medical bills, the 5 percent of Americans who make up 50 percent of the country’s healthcare costs. Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers will spend $40,375 on average per patient for someone in this group. Their out-of-pocket spending will be much less: on average, $2,582.90. This isn’t, in the scale of things, a lot of money—but given Americans’ straightened personal finances, it’s more than many can easily access. This isn’t, it’s important to point out, a static group. A chronic illness can land someone in this category but, given the increasing prevalence of high-deductible plans, so can something as simple as a broken bone or an emergency appendectomy. Although some people will be in this group year after year, many will cycle in and out, and nearly everyone will be in it for some brief period. The fact is that nearly any illness or injury can lead to unexpected bills, and few are able to absorb those shocks without difficulty. Yet, despite the commonness of such problems, there is little in the way of a system for helping people out through these times. Some of these people will declare bankruptcy. How many is the subject of controversy. A famous study—co-authored by Elizabeth Warren—found that suffering from a medical misfortune was the most common reason for ultimately leading someone to petition the courts for relief from their financial obligations, but another study pointed to unnecessary spending prior to the medical crisis. As it turns out, determining what counts as a medical expense is difficult. It’s not simply doctor bills. In addition to the not-covered deductibles, there is transportation to and from medical appointments, parking fees at many hospitals, and often childcare expenses while parents are in treatment or at appointments. Time for cooking will be limited, so take-out bills can pile up, too. And families that experience an illness are often hit by a double whammy—they lose income at the same time their financial needs grow, often cutting back on work hours or leaving work altogether, either voluntarily or not. McCarthy, for one, recently filed a lawsuit against his former employer, Daleview Care Center in Farmingdale, Long Island, claiming he was let go because of the amount of work he missed as result of his daughter’s illness, a violation of several laws including the Family Medical and Leave Act. In legal filings, Daleview denied McCarthy’s allegations, but the company did not return requests for comment. “The families get to the point where it’s, ‘What do I do? Do I pay the doctor bill because I’m getting collection notices? But I gotta pay my mortgage, I gotta pay my electric bill, I’ve gotta pay the rent.’ That’s where we come in,” Tom Pendergast of the Heather Pendergast Fund told me. “They can pay their mortgage, their rent, their electric bills and not have to worry about the medical part of it.” For many, the idea of charity to help those in need out—which is, after all, what saved the McCarthy family from financial disaster—holds much in the way of appeal, speaking to both a sense of generosity and a can-do spirit. It somehow seems, well, American, to think individual donations can compensate for a broken, expensive system that views illness as a moneymaking opportunity. So there is crowdfunding, small foundations like the Pendergast Fund, hospital-charity programs for the needy, and disease-specific resources. These efforts are patchy, and often inadequate, but they’re what’s available. Their strengths and their failings reveal a lot about the broader American healthcare system—something that is all too easy to ignore till it is your life or the life of a loved one at stake. CancerCare was founded in 1944 as a bereavement-support organization, but quickly began helping people with the disease manage their financial issues as well. “The first hospital bill we paid, in 1944, was to Memorial Sloan Kettering for $13 and change,” said Patricia Goldsmith, the organization’s chief executive officer. Today, finances are why between 60 and 70 percent of those who contact the organization reach out, and the dilemmas are the same as those people who turn to The Heather Pendergast Fund face.  “For the most part, people call us because they are in some kind of financial crisis,” says William Goeren, CancerCare’s director of clinical programs. “The prices have increased ... so that really puts the burden on the patient, who is weighing, ‘Do I pay for my mortgage or should I pay for my diagnostic test?’ These are the calls we are getting.” CancerCare attempts to head off these sorts of financial issues, while still offering emotional support to people in need. They offer a bereavement camp—located in Pennsylvania’s Poconos—and counseling groups for cancer sufferers and their children alike. They also distribute more than $4 million in transportation, home-care, and childcare assistance. But the heart of CancerCare’s aid is distributed through their disease-specific prescription co-pay funds, which award anywhere between $4,000 and $15,000 per patient to income-eligible patients. (“Income eligible” varies based on the fund, but is generally anywhere between 250 and 500 percent of the federal poverty line.) Last year, the organization distributed slightly more than $14.2 million in total. Such funds are not without controversy. The cost of treating cancer, a disease that will be newly diagnosed in just under 1.7 million Americans in 2017, is skyrocketing. According to research published in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the average cost of a year of a cancer treatment drug in 2000 was less than $10,000 in total. By 2005, that had more than tripled to between $30,000 to $50,000 annually. In 2012, 12 out of the 13 drugs newly approved for cancer cost more than $100,000. Another study, this one published in JAMA Oncology, found the price of one month of an oral-cancer medication increased from $1,869 in 2000 to $11,325 in 2014. As insurance companies, desperate to clamp down on their own expenses, cut reimbursements for the more expensive drugs, and employers, hoping to cut their own costs, push employees into high-deductible health-insurance plans, more of this cost ends up being picked up by the patients. A paper published by the journal Health Affairs in 2013 found cancer patients are more than twice as likely as their peers without the disease to declare bankruptcy. The consequences of this expense goes beyond the patient’s checkbook: Last year researchers writing for the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that cancer patients who declared bankruptcy were significantly more likely to die than those who did not need to ask the courts to discharge their debts. The reasons for the increased mortality are unclear: It’s possible people with shaky finances are less likely to receive adequate treatment, but it’s also possible stress is a contributor. Many believe the 2003 passage of Medicare Part D, which established coverage for pharmaceutical costs, is partially responsible for the price surge. The same legislation allowed for non-profit patient-advocacy groups to establish co-pay funds that could be funded by the pharmaceutical industry. (The CancerCare Co-Payment Foundation was established in 2007, for example.) These co-pay funds are meant by the organizations offering them to help people, but critics maintain the pharmaceutical-company contributions to organizations like CancerCare and others like it should be viewed less as charity and more as cover for the ever-increasing cost of their medications, since these donations allow pharmaceutical companies to stick insurance companies and government programs like Medicare with an ever-greater bill, while helping the consumers cover their share of the tab. “Co-pay programs are meant to mitigate criticism of high drug prices, deflect legislation on drug pricing, get around payer restrictions and get patients on expensive drugs they will stay on for a long time,” says Adriane Fugh-Berman, an associate professor at Georgetown University Medical Center and an expert on physician-industry relationships. The amount of money is also not enough. The phrase “drop in a bucket” barely does it justice. When CancerCare opened a $1.6 million fund for the co-payment of multiple myeloma medications this past April, it was exhausted within two days, Goldsmith told me. “I guarantee you tomorrow if for some reason we got $500 million tomorrow to support co-pay assistance, we could distribute that money likely within two months,” she said. But it is, she points out, better than not distributing the money at all. “I can tell you that that amount of money often makes the difference between people being able to get their treatment and not get their treatment.” This is hardly unique to CancerCare. Alan Balch, the chief executive officer of the Patient Advocate Foundation, which provides both case-management services and administers co-pay funds for a range of diseases and distributed more than $50 million in assistance in the fiscal year that ended in June of 2016, tells me that while some co-pay funds remain open for a considerable period of time, others open and close quickly. “There’s only so much money that is available at any one time and there’s so much demand for it,” he says. The evidence is clear when you visit the websites of the funds. The Patient Advocate Foundation’s chronic pain fund? Its aid is limited to $1,500 and you need to apply when it’s taking applications. “Effective 01/18/2017, we are unable to process applications that are pending or accept new or renewal applications at this time. Should additional funding for Chronic Pain Fund applicants become available in the future, it will be necessary to re-apply if assistance is still needed.” The Patient Advocate Foundation’s multiple-sclerosis and renal-cell-carcinoma funds have been closed to new applicants since 2016. It helps to have a more popular disease: Everyone I interviewed told me it was a lot easier to find funds to assist sufferers of, say, breast cancer, than it was an unusual malignant tumor. “The rarer the cancer, the less likely there will be funding for that cancer,” said William Goeren of CancerCare. For patients, this can seem like an elaborate, never-ending maze—and there is no central clearinghouse for the information. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Co-Pay Assistance Program will cover blood transfusions, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, among other things, but not diagnostic procedures like surgery or lab work. United Way offerings vary by locality. Still others, like the Pendergast Fund, are targeted to small populations and can fly under the raadar. The hospital where Cassidy McCarthy received her treatments, for example, did not inform the family about the Heather Pendergast Fund, but the organization’s work is well known in Long Island’s firefighting community. “The chief of the fire department came to me and goes, ‘Well, there’s this Pendergast Fund so any bills you have, just give them to me,’” McCarthy recalled. And even when medical supplicants find programs, they are not guaranteed aid even if they meet all the eligibility requirements. Amanda Collins, 36, is a Bartlesville, Oklahoma, resident who found herself financially scrambling after first her husband and then herself suffered a succession of medical crises. When the family finally obtained health insurance through Sooner Care—that’s Medicaid in Oklahoma—they were also given a list of local charities that could help out those in need.  She says she learned to call any organization, whether they were  offering aid with medical expenses or electric bills, mighty quick. “Then you call these services, not just for medical help, but any help. They tell you, ‘Oh, you have to hit us on this date,’ or ‘We get funding every month, but our funding is gone by the fifth of the month.’” But for many who do receive monetary aid in the face of a medically induced financial crisis, it helps them, but it doesn’t make their money woes go away. The American Kidney Fund, yet another patient-advocacy fund, put me in touch with Lori Noyes, a 55-year-old nurse living in Upland, California, with her two cocker spaniels, Kirby and Tucker. Noyes’ financial life all but collapsed when a donated kidney she received in childhood failed in early 2014. Her out-of-pocket cost for prescription co-pays was running about $200 a month. Every medical appointment resulted in more bills. “Each little doctor would take a swipe at you,” she told me. Credit-card bills mounted. Noyes, too, found herself struggling to navigate the charities that could potentially help. When she suffered vision loss following her kidney transplant and could no longer drive, it wasn’t anyone at a medical office who informed her of the Service Center for Independent Life, a Claremont, California based organization that helps people with disabilities with everything from transportation to employment assistance. A sympathetic Uber driver told her about the program. Finally, a financial counselor at the DaVita kidney-care location where she received dialysis suggested she reach out to the American Kidney Fund, which offered Noyes help paying her health-insurance bill and Medicare Part D premium. (All end-stage renal-failure patients are eligible for Medicare.) “It gave me wiggle room,” she says. But that still left Noyes with a lot of bills. Even with the help of the American Kidney Fund, Noyes claimed about $22,000 in medical expenses on her taxes in 2014 and $19,000 in 2015, which included everything from dressing supplies and over-the-counter medications to travel expenses to and from the transplant center where she ultimately received a donated kidney. There are few—if any—charitable organizations willing or able to hand out this amount of assistance. As for hospital-based charity, it can vary widely. Most studies find for-profit hospitals provide less charity care than nonprofit medical centers. But getting aid from a non-profit hospital isn’t exactly a gimme. A paper published by the Brookings Institution in 2015 pointed out that the non-profit hospitals with the most funds that could be devoted to charity care—that is, covering or forgiving medical bills of those who cannot pay full—are not located in the geographic areas where the need is greatest. The higher the wealth in a particular region, the more money a hospital is likely to have for indigent or needy patients. But those patients who need financial assistance are likely to live in lower-income areas where there is less in the way of resources. The paper uses two hospitals in Connecticut’s Fairfield County to make the point. The facility located in the high-income New York City suburb of Greenwich offers assistance to people with higher incomes than one located in Norwalk, a less wealthy town located a mere 15 miles away. But despite the lower ceiling, a much higher percentage of the Norwalk hospital’s bad-debt cases turned out to meet the eligibility guidelines for charity care. Moreover, in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, a number of nonprofit hospitals actually lowered the eligibility ceiling for charity assistance, thinking that such a change would encourage more people to sign up for health insurance. (For example, BJC Healthcare, headquartered in St. Louis, now only offers aid to people with household incomes of 300 percent of the federal poverty line, compared to 400 percent previously.) But because of the increasingly high deductibles, even people who didn’t meet the threshold for aid under the older, more generous standards are now experiencing financial grief as a result of medical bills. In an effort to cut down on uncollectable bills, a number of hospitals are now teaming up with financial services firms like Commerce Bank to offer time-limited interest free loans to patients something that, while helpful to some, most certainly is not charity. When I catch up with Savannah Dray—she calls me from her car, on the way back to her Tallahassee apartment from a chemotherapy session—she begins rattling off her debt. “I have all kinds of medical bills. I have pathology bills. I have radiology bills. I have oral surgeon bills because the disease eroded parts of my teeth and broke them off. Now I have a regular dental as well as an oral surgeon bill. I have bills from my CT scans, which I guess would fall under radiology. I have surgery bills.” Dray, 22, was diagnosed earlier this year with stage-three colon cancer. How much does she owe overall? She can’t tell me. The bills are coming in by the day, and have been pretty much since the January day she doubled over with pain, and went to a nearby emergency room. But it’s definitely more than $10,000. She met her own $6,250 deductible, and then switched over to her husband’s plan when she left work as an assistant manager for a chain store. She now needs to meet that $6,250 deductible too. A financial counselor at her oncologist’s office told Dray about CancerCare, as well as programs available from the American Cancer Society and Stupid Cancer, an advocacy and aid group for young adults fighting malignancies. But Dray says she was initially so overwhelmed by her illness and all the bills, she didn’t have the energy to reach out. For Dray, crowdfunding was a more familiar process, so she went with that. Only after she raised $4,712 toward a $30,000 goal on a page she set up at GoFundMe did she send an application in to CancerCare for financial assistance. Little wonder, then, that an increasing number of patients turn to crowdfunding even before they investigate more established charitable giving programs. While turning to friends and family and holding fundraisers for medical bills has almost certainly been with us as long as people have paid for assistance when ill, turning to the Internet to plead for help with medical expenses is less than ten years old. Yet it has become all but ubiquitous, seemingly the first thing many people think to do when confronted by a medical crisis or tragedy.  Last year’s Orlando nightclub shootings inspired numerous crowdsharing efforts for everything from survivors medical bills to help for families paying funeral expenses. The same thing happened this year, when two men were killed and another injured by a man shouting anti-Muslim sentiments at a woman wearing a hijab in Portland, Oregon.* Recommending patients experiencing trouble with their bills give crowdfunding a try has turned into all but a personal-finance trope. “Do you need money for unexpected medical and long-term-care expenses, funeral costs, or a local charitable endeavor? Maybe it’s time to turn to one of the growing number of personal ‘crowdfunding’ sites and ask the public for small donations,” chirped Kiplinger’s last fall. Newspaper articles about successful campaigns are a staple of what remains of the local press and heartwarming articles about the practice abound. The truth is more than a bit darker. A few years ago, Ethan Austin, the co-founder of Give Forward (which recently merged with YouCaring, another crowdfunding site), one of the first sites to realize that crowdfunding could be as useful for people facing medical bills as those seeking to fund an independent film or fund a business venture, spoke to a group of students at New York University’s Stern School of Business about his site. He was blunt about one of the reasons he believed this segment of the online fundraising world had taken off so dramatically. “Our health-care system is shit and it’s trending shittier,” he told the group.  Last year, Nerdwallet broke down the numbers and discovered that just under 50 percent of the money raised by GoFundMe campaigns is somehow related to healthcare. There’s likely a measure of nowhere-else-to-turn desperation involved: A study published earlier this year by Lauren Berliner and Nora Kenworthy, both on faculty at the University of Washington Bothell, found that residents of states that didn’t take advantage of the Affordable Care Act to offer more residents access to Medicaid were over-represented on crowdfunding sites. Yet for all the attention paid to crowdfunding, the limited evidence we have shows that for most people, the hype is better than the actual results. A 2015 analysis by Nerdwallet found only 11 percent of healthcare fundraisers on Fundrazr, GiveForward, GoFundMe, Plumfund, and Red Basket met the organizer’s financial target. Berliner and Kenworthy, who studied a random selection of 200 campaigns on GoFundMe, found a very similar result. Nine in 10 were never funded in full. According to Berliner and Kenworthy, most campaigns don’t go viral. Instead, they stay among the ill person’s existing social networks. “There seems to be some allure about what campaigns can do that exceeds what we are seeing they can do,” says Berliner. “It’s probably unlikely that you have some billionaires in your mix who are just looking to swoop in,” adds Kenworthy. In the healthcare community, some experts are increasingly down on the concept. “We don’t recommend it routinely,” says Anne Bailey, a vice president for patient support at DaVita, the chain of dialysis centers where Noyes received treatment. In her view, crowdfunding works best for a one-time emergency, not a medical issue that will potentially go on for years. “That’s just not an acceptable solution for a long-term chronic medical issue.” For the 5 percent of people with the largest medical bills, crowdfunding is unlikely to come through, or least to come through in a way that solves the financial problem in the long term. Nonetheless, it’s also true that every little bit helps. If Dray’s campaign hasn’t met her hoped-for expectations, it’s far from useless. She’s already been able to use some of the money to pay for oral surgery, not to mention to make a co-payment for a cardiologist. If not for the GoFundMe and an account on Instagram where she sells her art, she tells me, she’s not sure she could handle her medical bills, keep a roof over her head, and food in the kitchen. I spoke with numerous people for this piece who told me that at some point, after all the fundraising, and asking for aid for organizations, and cleaning out of retirement and savings accounts, they simply put all their remaining bills on a credit card, and hoped for the best. They simply couldn’t take the constant barrage of mail from numerous separate medical providers and facilities. For many, the financial turmoil caused by their illness already adds to the emotional and physical turmoil they are already experiencing. “Many people call us, and I am speaking anecdotally and they are angry. They say I’ve been working my whole life, I’ve paid my taxes, I’ve been diligent, but now I’m being slammed, I have to ask for charity ... There’s shame and anger in that,” says Richard Dickens, CancerCare’s director of client advocacy. But there is more than simple embarrassment arguing against this system. It’s the equivalent of taping a few bandages over a gaping wound and hoping for the best. The cost of medical care is so high, and the personal finances of many Americans so tight,  it’s all but impossible for any organization—or all of them—to keep up, and that’s whether or not the charitable contributions they accept are part of the problem or the solution. And this is now. Should Republicans succeed in their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an estimated 23 million people would lose health-insurance coverage over the next decade. That would almost certainly put even more pressure on the charitable resources available to help those in need pay for medical care. Yet illness exists in the here and now. People need the money, so we open our wallets and we give what we can, feeling a little good about doing our part. And it does help some: As CancerCare’s Patricia Goldsmith puts it, “I can tell you that that amount of money often makes the difference between people being able to get their treatment, and not get their treatment.” As for Cassidy McCarthy, she received what the family hopes was her last dose of chemotherapy on May 22. Both she and a brother will be attending a summer camp for children with cancer and their siblings that’s offered free of charge. Daniel McCarthy has a new job, and no longer needs assistance with his insurance premium. When a recent $45 blood-work lab bill recently arrived, the family didn’t forward it to Pendergast. They paid it themselves. “Some other people might need the money,” McCarthy said. If the family is lucky, they’re heading toward the best approach to avoiding big medical bills in the future: good health. * This article originally stated the location of the attack as Portland, Maine.

A Triumph of Misinformation - The Atlantic,39726,"The Clinton plan would have imposed sweeping changes on one seventh of the national economy, with consequences far greater than Congress could possibly consider before casting a rushed vote. It represented a regulation-minded, top-down, centralized approach at a time when the world was moving toward decentralization and flexibility—and when the supposed health crisis was solving itself anyway. The more people learned about this plan, the less they liked it, and it finally died a natural and well-deserved death. Or so goes the conventional wisdom, as relayed in countless newspaper and magazine postmortems of the health-care struggle. The critiques were usually accompanied by veiled jabs at Hillary Clinton—what will she do with her time now that health care's gone?—and outright ridicule of Magaziner, who was portrayed as the smartest person with the dumbest plan since Robert McNamara and the Vietnam War. But suppose that what everyone knows is wrong. This happens all the time in politics. Barely a year ago, for example, everyone in Washington knew that Congress was absolutely certain to pass a health-care program by now. The leaders of the Administration's health-care-reform effort, Hillary Clinton and Magaziner, believe that everyone is wrong again now. I heard them elaborate this view in September and October, during a series of long background conversations. ""Background"" means that I agreed to check with them on any material I wanted to quote directly. The gist of their views, however, was on the record. It is no surprise that they view the reform plan as something other than an overcomplicated bureaucratic nightmare. The surprise is how much more convincing their version of reality is than the prevailing one. These conversations began at Magaziner's suggestion. He and I were friends in graduate school, more than twenty years ago, and he was obviously betting that I'd listen to him more sympathetically than other reporters would. I am biased, in that I like and respect Magaziner. But until these meetings I had had no contact with him during his time as health czar, and I have not always agreed with his ideas. (His worst achievement: helping bring a no-requirements curriculum to Brown University, when he was the student-body president in 1969.) In this case the facts seem to be on his side. Let's consider each count in the conventional bill of indictment against the Clinton Magaziner plan. First count: The plan was hatched in secret. During the 1992 presidential campaign Bill Clinton talked frequently about his interest in health-care reform and gave a signal about the reform approach he preferred. In a speech in September he recommended ""competition within a budget."" To the health-care cognoscenti this indicated an approach different from the main Republican and Democratic proposals of the time. The most familiar Democratic approaches were ""single-payer"" and ""play-or-pay."" Single-payer, which was endorsed during the 1992 Democratic primaries by Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska, meant a Canadian-style or Medicare-style system. Private doctors and hospitals would provide care, but the government would take over all medical payments, financing them with a big new medical tax. All Americans would be covered. Play-or-pay, supported by many Democrats, required companies either to buy health insurance for their workers or to pay into a public fund, which would insure workers not covered by their companies. People who were not working would not be insured. An approach popular among Republicans relied on new tax breaks to encourage people to buy health insurance on their own. Some politicians from both parties endorsed a ""managed competition"" scheme, separate from all these. Clinton's reference to ""competition within a budget"" fit a proposal laid out in the fall of 1992 by Paul Starr, a Princeton professor, in a short book called The Logic of Health Care Reform. This book came closer than any other document to anticipating the ultimate shape of the Clinton-Magaziner bill. In Starr's plan, which was a variation on a managed-competition scheme, all Americans would be covered—even if they were out of work, even if they had ""pre existing conditions."" The cost of coverage would be paid mainly by companies, which would contribute to the insurance premiums for each of their workers. The government would subsidize coverage for those who were unemployed or worked for small firms. Private insurance companies would offer coverage, as they do now, but the government would ""manage"" the way they competed for business. Each company would come up with a list of standard benefits, which it would have to offer at the same price to all customers. That is, the insurers could not turn down people who were already sick, or charge fifty-five-year-old applicants more than thirty-year-olds. Each year people could compare the offers and choose the plan they liked best—including a fee-for-service plan that let them go to their family doctor. From the customer's point of view, the system would work like the ""open enrollment"" policy at many corporations, in which employees can choose a new health plan each year. The government would set an overall limit on the amount of money that could be spent on medical care each year, while giving insurance companies and health plans latitude to spend the money as they thought best. This limit was the ""budget"" in Clinton's reference to ""competition within a budget."" With numerous changes of detail and emphasis, the plan that Starr explained in his book and that Clinton alluded to in his campaign became the plan the Clinton Magaziner task force unveiled in 1993. The most important difference lay in what was meant by ""within a budget"": the bill that Clinton presented would have limited total spending not directly, by fiat, but indirectly, by limiting the amount that insurance premiums could rise each year. The process of working out these details and emphases kept Magaziner and some 500 task-force members busy round the clock during the Administration's first few months. According to today's conventional wisdom, these meetings doomed the reform effort before it really began, for it was here that Magaziner and his fellow nerds cooked up their unrealistic schemes. But did the process seem weird, secretive, and isolated at the time? Yes, but in only one limited and revealing way. On matters of substance, the task force went out of its way to hear a variety of views. Most members of the task force were policy or budget officials borrowed from other parts of the government, but the group also included outside scholars and experts, plus several doctors and nurses. There were no representatives of organized outside interests—no delegate from the American Medical Association, no one from the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America—but the task force met frequently with outside groups and above all with senators, representatives, and their staffs. By early May, Congressional Quarterly reported, the task force had met with 572 separate organizations. ""We had a couple of hundred meetings with the congressional leadership and individual members,"" Magaziner says now. ""People were saying that it was the biggest outreach effort ever in laying the groundwork for a bill."" Indeed they were saying so. A Congressional Quarterly headline on May 22 read, ""Clinton Task Force All Ears on the Subject of Overhaul."" The article said, ""Most members of Congress give the president high marks for laying the political groundwork necessary for his proposal to get the careful consideration of both parties. . . . Clinton has been playing the health-care issue with an eye to keeping everyone at the table, at least at the outset."" In late September of 1993, when Hillary Clinton appeared before five congressional committees in three days to explain the rationale behind the bill, not a single legislator complained about ""closed"" or ""secretive"" deliberations: not Robert Dole, not Robert Packwood, not John Danforth—Republican senators who all later came out against the bill. Senator John Breaux, of Louisiana, a conservative Democrat who supported a competing reform plan, praised Hillary Clinton for the ""truly remarkable"" consultations the task force had carried out. So when did the task force become ""secretive""? Complaints inevitably arose when Magaziner and his assistants stopped soliciting outside advice and started announcing decisions. Those who disagreed felt that they hadn't been listened to. ""Some people say they were excluded because in this case we didn't agree with them,"" Hillary Clinton told me. ""But I think that a fair assessment is that we listened to everybody—and then made recommendations based on what we thought made the most sense."" The larger problem was with the one group that truly was excluded from the deliberations—the Washington press and, by extension, the public in whose interest it is supposed to act. During the brusque early weeks of the Clinton Administration, when George Stephanopoulos was walling reporters out of the White House press office and the Administration thought it could use talk shows to take its message directly to the public, over the heads of the daily press, Magaziner was told by the White House communications office that he and his associates should not talk to reporters about what ideas they were considering for the new bill. Instead they were supposed to refer all queries to the communications office. This didn't stop leaks, of course, but it gave Magaziner a lasting reputation among reporters as a man who liked to operate in the dark. Hillary Clinton is known within the Administration for a combative attitude toward the press. But she now says that the news blackout on emerging details of the health bill was a major mistake. ""Even though we had a process unlike any other that has drafted a bill,"" she told me, ""—more open, more inclusive—we got labeled as being secretive because of . . . our failure to understand that we should be more available to the press along the way. That was something we didn't do well. . . . We were not aware of how significant it is to [shape] the inside story in Washington, in order to make the case . . . for whatever your policy is."" Secrecy toward reporters was stupid. But reporters are now acting as if it were something worse: closed-mindedness about ideas. Second count: The plan was politically naive. Everyone now knows that the health care reformers drew up their master plan without taking the slightest interest in what most Americans thought or felt. In reality, though, the plan suffered because the Administration was too attentive to shifting political moods. Even before Inauguration Day, Magaziner was churning out memos about the right way to pitch the plan to editorialists and interest groups, about the likely Republican arguments and how to rebut them, about the connection between a health-care bill and a re-election campaign in 1996. Week in and week out his memos to Bill and Hillary Clinton contained head counts of likely Senate and House votes—who was leaning, who could be pressured and pushed. In his conversations with me Magaziner seemed to spend half his time sizing up the legislators he had had to deal with: Senator X was in thrall to Bob Dole because of personal problems, Congressman Y had to start out opposing the bill because of donations from Interest Group Z. Two fundamental decisions about the plan had much less to do with policy than with judgments of political reality. One involved handling the single-payer challenge. A Canadian-style single-payer system has two big virtues. It is simple to administer, since doctors, hospitals, and patients no longer have to worry about dozens of insurance companies with scores of different payment plans. The single payer approach also guarantees that everyone in the country has medical coverage. But Clinton was dead set against a single-payer plan, arguing that it would require sweeping new taxes and would, in effect, abolish the entire medical-insurance industry. This left the political problem of how to deal with the hundred or so members of the House who supported some kind of single-payer plan. Without them, no health bill of Clinton's could possibly pass. Congress also contained a large number of supporters of market-reform and managed-competition plans. The main advantage of such plans is that they change the incentives of medical practice so that doctors, patients, and hospitals are more conscious of costs when making medical decisions. To get a plan passed, Clinton had to show that it would reform the medical market. ""We had to try to bridge the chasm"" between these groups in drawing up the plan, Magaziner told me. ""If we were serious about universal coverage, we felt, then the single-payer people would buy off even if they didn't like managed competition. We felt we were doing enough of the market reforms that the reform people would buy off too. And, by the way, we also thought that that was the best policy."" But by June of 1993 one of the main market-reform legislators, Representative Jim Cooper, of Tennessee, made clear that he wouldn't buy off. He recommended seeing to insurance reforms first and getting around to universal coverage in a few years. The single-payer group, of course, was not going to agree to that. ""At that point,"" Magaziner said, ""we knew that the only way we could try to bridge the chasm was to start a little bit left of center and try to negotiate toward the center."" ""Left of center"" meant proposing a benefits package a little more generous than what the Administration really wanted, setting the employer's share of total costs a little bit higher, making the limits on insurance premiums a little bit tighter. When the Republican Party lost interest in negotiating, this strategy became a liability, because it made the Clinton plan look more extreme than it was meant to be. The other purely political calculation concerned sales strategy. Throughout his campaign Bill Clinton had emphasized the overall cost of medical care as a central evil of the U.S. system. Americans spend about twice as much money per capita on medical care as people in other developed nations, with results that are not twice as good. Whenever he was asked about cutting the budget deficit or taming the entitlements monster, Clinton said that the first and most important step was to control health-care costs. This approach won the support of business, since health insurance costs had for years been rising faster than any other business expense. (From 1948 to 1990, Paul Starr points out, business spending on health coverage rose by an average of 15.6 percent a year.) Through most of 1993, while the plan was being developed and unveiled, major business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers supported its general outlines and accepted even its ""employer mandates,"" which would require companies to pay most of the cost of coverage for their employees. But by the summer of 1994 the Administration was selling the plan mainly as a matter of fairness and security. Its slogan was ""Health Care That's Always There."" In theory the Administration could have kept stressing both aspects of its plan—that it would make individuals more secure while reducing the strain on business. The peculiar logic of health-care economics, as revealed in most other developed countries and in American group-care systems, is that when everyone is covered, it becomes easier to control overall costs. The Administration's political experts, however, recommended a more streamlined sales approach. Clinton's pollster, Stanley Greenberg, produced results in 1993 showing that no one believed that a government health-care plan could ever save money. Although opinion polls taken through the end of 1993 showed that most people supported the idea behind Clinton's plan (once pollsters explained what the idea was), most people also believed that the plan would drive costs up, not down. Therefore the more the Administration emphasized its cost-control themes, the less believable it would become. ""The polls showed that people will trust the government to guarantee them security,"" Magaziner told me. ""They will not believe that the government can control costs."" As Republican opposition to the bill increased in 1994, Democratic strategists decided that ""security"" would be a more effective, partisan rallying theme. ""You have to mobilize people, and it's hard to mobilize people around words like 'cost containment' or 'universal coverage,'"" Hillary Clinton told me. ""So if we didn't convince the middle class that universal coverage meant them, we wouldn't get the political support. . . . If you talked about how they could lose their job, how they are one divorce or one pre-existing condition away from losing coverage, then perhaps they would get engaged."" By the end of the struggle this sales approach made the Administration even more vulnerable to Republican charges that it was putting out a bighearted, soft-headed, typically liberal plan. One other enormously important, and almost purely political, decision sealed the fate of the bill. Magaziner and Hillary Clinton had hoped to present the bill to Congress a few months after the Inauguration, in the spring of 1993. Thanksgiving had nearly come before they were actually ready to present a finished bill. That delay had little or nothing to do with the nuances of policy. It had everything to do with political necessity—and of a sort that everyone knew was sensible at the time. Third count: ""The First Lady's whiz-kids wasted precious months."" This was how The Economist stated the next objection. Rather than getting busy and presenting the plan when the Administration still had a dewy glow, the health team sat around until it was too late. The Administration's original strategy was to rush the health plan through as part of its first budget-reconciliation bill. That would have meant having detailed health proposals ready by April at the latest, and the task force had been geared toward meeting that deadline. The genius of this approach, little noticed by the public, is that it would have allowed the health plan to pass with a simple majority vote. Congressional politics has quietly moved into the ""supermajority"" system that Lani Guinier was widely denounced for seeming to recommend. In theory it takes fifty one votes to get a bill through the Senate. In reality it takes sixty votes to end a filibuster, so Bill Clinton knew that the Senate's forty-plus Republicans could stop nearly any legislation they chose. They could not stop budget bills. These come to the floor under rules that limit debate, and with only a fifty-one-vote majority required for passage. So if the health care plan could be made part of the budget bill, the Administration could get it acted on quickly, with enough of its own party's votes to see it through. The Senate's majority leader, George Mitchell, endorsed this strategy, but its de facto parliamentarian, Robert Byrd, objected, scuttling the plan. The Administration then decided that it would introduce the health-care plan as soon as the budget bill passed. But passage was the rub. The budget bill, with its big deficit-reduction package, was seen by everyone in Washington as a major early test of the Administration's strength. (The struggle over the bill is the subject of Bob Woodward's book The Agenda.) The budget fight dragged on much longer than Bill Clinton had hoped or planned. As it became obvious that the final budget vote would be very close (on August 6 it finally passed the Senate 51-50, with Vice President Al Gore casting the deciding vote), the Administration wanted to avoid any extraneous controversy that might affect it. Clinton had been scheduled to make the final decisions about the health care plan in late May. Because of fears that leaks about his choices would complicate the budget vote, the decisions were put off—a delay that had ripple effects lasting the rest of the year. Without Clinton's decisions, the task force could not prepare detailed legislation; without legislation, it could not start negotiations with congressmen and their staffs. Without final choices on what would be in the package, it could not prepare budget estimates; without those estimates, the Treasury and the Congressional Budget Office could not vet the plan. By the fall the budget fight was over—but then NAFTA became the issue of the moment. Clinton had been scheduled to spend most of the month of October traveling and speaking about the health-care plan. As he was flying to his first event, a labor convention in California, news came that U.S. soldiers had been killed in Somalia. Clinton flew back to Washington after his speech and spent most of the month dealing with Somalia and NAFTA; he canceled all the other health care events. Despite the delays and missteps, when the President finally unveiled the plan, in September of 1993, it seemed to have a good chance. ""The reviews are in and the box office is terrific,"" the political analyst William Schneider wrote just after it was presented. ""President Clinton's health care reform plan is a hit. . . . The more people read and hear about the plan, the more they seem to like it."" Six weeks after the Inauguration, Magaziner had written a memo to Bill and Hillary Clinton saying that if health-care-reform legislation was not presented and passed immediately, it probably could not be passed during ""your first term."" With Republican midterm gains in Congress, it now appears that this prediction will be borne out. But the delay was neither negligent nor intentional. It is a reminder of how quickly events spin out of a President's control, and how rare it is for him to be able to advance his own agenda rather than respond to someone else's emergency. Fourth count: The plan had delusions of grandeur. Now we move to the substance of the plan, which has been described as a regulatory rat's nest, a nightmare of overambitious social engineering, and a sweeping solution where modest reforms would do. The reality is that very little in this plan was new or unprecedented, and that it was barely more complex or comprehensive than most other plans. When people complained that the plan was grandiose, they had three features in mind: universal coverage (everyone would be insured, whether working or not), community rating (everyone in a given region would pay the same premium for coverage, regardless of age or pre-existing conditions), and employer mandates (forcing businesses to cover much of the insurance cost). All these ideas have been part of the health-care-reform debate for years. Universal coverage and community rating sound like bleeding-heart concepts, but they are based on tough economic reasoning. The idea behind both is that piecemeal reform of a health-care system can be worse than no reform at all. The fairness argument for universal coverage is obvious. Even people who are poor deserve care when they are sick or hurt. This is why every developed nation except the United States offers universal care. The economic argument has become almost as familiar. Even people without health insurance ultimately receive treatment, when they show up in emergency wards; hospitals cover the cost by padding charges for everyone else. This backhanded form of coverage is neither economically efficient nor humane. As recently as the fall of 1993 Bob Dole was saying that universal coverage was a ""non-negotiable goal of reform."" Community rating is a closely related idea. Every health-care-reform scheme in America is concerned with holding down costs. In most businesses market competition does the job, but competition in the health-insurance area often works in a perverse way. Insurance companies have tended to compete not by improving the incentives, habits, and nature of medical treatment—which in the long run is the only way to limit expenses—but by becoming choosier about whom they will insure. If they can limit their coverage to young, healthy people and rule out those who are already sick, then they can offer coverage at a lower price, without having done anything to improve the efficiency of care. This is what has happened to the health-insurance business in the past generation. In the old days Blue Cross offered coverage to everyone in the same geographic area at the same price. Now younger, healthier people can get cheaper coverage—which many of them skip anyway, figuring they don't need it—while prices rise for those most likely to need care. Fewer of them can afford to buy it, more must take advantage of the cruel and inefficient fallback of emergency-room coverage, and overall costs keep going up. The young, healthy people eventually become old and sick, and are caught too. This cycle is known as adverse selection, and it has been talked about in the health care-reform business for years. Community rating is the main response. It is designed to average each person's medical costs over the course of his or her whole life and to make sure that people have coverage at the times of their lives when it's most necessary. In proposing community rating the Clinton team was hardly making waves. Even the part of the plan that sounded strangest and most radical, its ""mandatory alliances,"" is already familiar to millions of Americans under a different name. Anyone who works for a big company or a state or federal agency knows about the open-enrollment system for selecting health insurance. The company or agency negotiates with HMOs, insurance companies, and local medical networks that want to offer coverage to its employees. Once a year employees choose which plan they want. The employer then deducts money from their paychecks, adds its own share, and passes the money on to the medical providers. This, with small variations, is also how the task force's mandatory alliances would have worked. They would have taken bids from insurance companies, HMOs, and other health providers and then let each household choose the plan it liked best. Each provider would have been required to set a price for a standard benefits plan, so that customers could make easy price comparisons among the offerings. The alliances would not, as has often been assumed, have tried to provide medical care themselves, through big new government clinics. The most ominous-sounding aspect of the new alliance system was its ""mandatory"" nature. Everyone would have been obliged to choose and buy a standard benefits plan from an alliance. (Contrary to repeated claims by opponents of the bill, people would have been free to buy any extra coverage they wanted, or get any additional treatment from any doctor they chose, as long as they did it with their own money. Employers would also have been free to offer additional coverage.) The health-care task force argued that the alliances had to be mandatory in order to create the community-rating effect. Otherwise, young, healthy people would stay out of the system, and the pernicious cycle of adverse selection would begin. An exception was made for employees of very large companies, who would still have been able to buy through their own firms' open-enrollment plans. The reasoning was that a General Motors or an AT&T had a work force large and diverse enough to constitute a community-rating pool all by itself. Everyone would have been forced into a pool one way or another. Some health-care-reform plans have no mandatory component. Several versions of managed competition, for instance, would set up alliances like those in the Clinton bill but not require anyone to buy from them. It is virtually impossible, though, to achieve universal coverage without some element of compulsion. (Medicare offers universal coverage for those over sixty-five, but everyone who works is compelled to pay a Medicare tax.) Moreover, Magaziner argued, for most people the mandatory system would in practice mean more choice and freedom than they now enjoy. When he ran a small business in Rhode Island, Magaziner said, he covered all health-insurance costs for his employees but could give them only two plans to choose from. Handling the bidding and paperwork for a broad range of plans would have been impossible. ""If there had been an alliance, I could have paid my dues to the alliance and let people choose among all the plans."" The alliances in the Clinton bill would have been required to offer customers a choice among all plans that met basic certification requirements. In big cities a dozen or more plans might be available. The minimum offering would be three kinds of coverage, including at least one fee-for-service plan that would permit a family to stay with the independent doctor it had been using. After the plan was withdrawn, Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, told The New York Times, ""No one understood this, but the average American patient would have had more choice under the Clinton plan than they now will. If you work for a particular company, your choice of HMOs is whatever that company offers you."" Some critics argued that the Clinton plan would destroy the market for coverage beyond the plan's basic benefits, and that as a result people would find it difficult to buy as much coverage as they might like. But that is different from the widespread belief that extra coverage would be against the law- and for most people the range of choice would probably be broader under Clinton's plan. Far from concocting a system that would look and feel radically different from what Americans were accustomed to, the task force believed that it was changing the surface of health care as little as possible while altering its underlying economic structure. The alliance system, despite its strange name, was meant to look familiar to people who already had coverage. The employer-mandate system of finance, in which companies would bear most of the health-insurance costs, reflected the fact that 90 percent of the people who now have insurance (excluding those on Medicare) get it through their employer. The employer mandate is a de facto tax but a well-established one, and a familiar concept in health-policy circles. Many Republicans, including Robert Packwood and Richard Nixon(!), have over the years endorsed employer-mandate plans. Indeed, none of the individual elements of the Clinton plan was a shocking new entrant into the health-care debate. The plan's system for controlling expenditures, through premium caps that limited how fast the cost of basic coverage could rise, departed from Paul Starr's recommendations. But it closely resembled a plan offered by a group of congressional moderates that included the Republican senators John Danforth and Nancy Kassebaum. To say that the resulting package of proposals was ""too complex"" is like saying that an airplane's blueprint is too complicated. The Medicare system is complex. So is every competing health-care-reform plan. Most of the 1,342 pages of Clinton's Health Security Act (which I have read) are either pure legal boilerplate or amendments to existing law. Conventional wisdom now holds that the sheer bulk of the bill guaranteed its failure. The Nafta bill was just as long, and so was the crime bill that passed last summer. If the health bill had been shorter and had not passed, everyone would know that any proposal so sketchy and incomplete never had a chance. Fifth count: It was a coercive approach to one seventh of the economy—and to a problem that was solving itself. Much of the problem for the plan seemed, at least in Washington, to come not even from mandatory alliances but from an article by Elizabeth McCaughey, then of the Manhattan Institute, published in The New Republic last February. The article's working premise was that McCaughey, with no ax to grind and no preconceptions about health care, sat down for a careful reading of the whole Clinton bill. Appalled at the hidden provisions she found, she felt it her duty to warn people about what the bill might mean. The title of her article was ""No Exit,"" and the message was that Bill and Hillary Clinton had proposed a system that would lock people in to government-run care. ""The law will prevent you from going outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better,"" McCaughey wrote in the first paragraph. ""The doctor can be paid only by the plan, not by you."" George Will immediately picked up this warning, writing in Newsweek that ""it would be illegal for doctors to accept money directly from patients, and there would be 15-year jail terms for people driven to bribery for care they feel they need but the government does not deem 'necessary.'"" The ""doctors in jail"" concept soon turned up on talk shows and was echoed for the rest of the year. These claims, McCaughey's and Will's, were simply false. McCaughey's pose of impartiality was undermined by her campaign as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of New York soon after her article was published. I was less impressed with her scholarly precision after I compared her article with the text of the Clinton bill. Her shocked claim that coverage would be available only for ""necessary"" and ""appropriate"" treatment suggested that she had not looked at any of today's insurance policies. In claiming that the bill would make it impossible to go outside the health plan or pay doctors on one's own, she had apparently skipped past practically the first provision of the bill (Sec. 1003), which said, ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the following: (1) An individual from purchasing any health care services."" It didn't matter. The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which The New Republic did not run. Instead it published a long piece by McCaughey attacking the White House statement. The idea of health policemen stuck. So did the idea that one seventh of the national economy would be transformed overnight. Of the vast American commerce in health care, more than 40 percent is already paid for by the federal government, mainly through Medicare. Under the Clinton plan the rest of the money would still go through most of the insurance companies, HMOs, doctors, hospitals, and laboratories that are receiving it now. The final element in the conventional wisdom is that this cumbersome, flawed plan was in any case unnecessary, because the health-care problem was going away. Medical costs rose by ""only"" 5.9 percent in 1993—yet that was more than twice as fast as wage growth and almost twice as fast as the overall inflation rate. Over the past several decades medical costs have risen about three percent faster than the overall inflation rate; in 1993 the gap was 2.9 percent. ""There is no persuasive evidence that we are in either a stabilized or an improving health-care-financing environment,"" Hillary Clinton told me. ""In fact, many of the problems will only continue to get worse. The problems that middle-class Americans care the most about—like what doctor they can see—will likely become appreciably worse, because many will be forced into managed care over which they have no say. Employers will make those decisions. They will pay more for fewer benefits. How deeply this sinks in and how much it motivates political action, I don't know."" If this plan did not perish because it had been designed in intolerable secrecy, or because its designers knew nothing about politics, or because it was full of unacceptable new ideas, or because it was so much more complex than any predecessors, then what happened to it? The Administration's view, for which, again, there is ample evidence, is that it went down because of two zero-sum games, one political and one economic. Health care reform became a battle in which some would win and others would lose—and Clinton lost. Through most of 1993 the Republicans believed that a health-reform bill was inevitable, and they wanted to be on the winning side. Bob Dole said he was eager to work with the Administration and appeared at events side by side with Hillary Clinton to endorse universal coverage. Twenty-three Republicans said that universal coverage was a given in a new bill. In 1994 the Republicans became convinced that the President and his bill could be defeated. Their strategist, William Kristol, wrote a memo recommending a vote against any Administration health plan, ""sight unseen."" Three committees in the House and two in the Senate began considering the bill in earnest early in the year. Republicans on several committees had indicated that they would collaborate with Democrats on a bill; as the year wore on, Republicans dropped their support, one by one, for any health bill at all. Robert Packwood, who had supported employer mandates for twenty years, discovered that he opposed them in 1994. ""[He] has assumed a prominent role in the campaign against a Democratic alternative that looks almost exactly like his own earlier policy prescriptions,"" the National Journal wrote. Early last summer conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans tried to put together a ""mainstream coalition"" supporting a plan without universal coverage, without employer mandates, and without other features that Republicans had opposed. In August, George Mitchell, the Democratic Party's Senate majority leader, announced a plan that was almost pure symbolism—no employer mandates, very little content except a long-term goal of universal coverage. Led by Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, Republicans by September were opposing any plan. ""Every time we moved toward them, they would move away,"" Hillary Clinton says. ""We always knew that in the end people's trust of the President and First Lady would be crucial,"" Ira Magaziner says. ""The debate was going to be complicated, and that trust factor was very important."" Whitewater eroded the trust factor. The President looked beatable, and he lost. Economic factors counted too. Doctors had fought bitterly against Medicare in the early 1960s, but for the most part they sat this battle out. If they weren't controlled by the government, they would be controlled by insurance companies, which in some ways were worse. But other interest groups had more to lose. Health-insurance agents would be put out of business. Health-insurance companies could have their premiums capped. For-profit hospitals thought they would lose money. Manufacturers of medical equipment thought that market growth might slow. Large businesses that did not already offer health care for workers knew the employer mandate would cost them money. (These were mainly corporations like PepsiCo and General Mills, which own restaurant chains whose part-time workers are uninsured.) During the 1992 campaign the Clinton war room excelled at answering negative charges immediately, before damaging impressions could set in. But even flatly untrue attacks on the health plan went unanswered—direct-mail campaigns saying that everyone would have to go to a government clinic, daily doses of misinformation from Rush Limbaugh, TV advertisements fanning McCaughey style fears of jail terms for people who wanted to stick with their family doctor. Last March The Wall Street Journal found that a panel of citizens preferred the provisions of the Clinton plan to the main alternatives—when each plan was described by its contents alone. But when pollsters explained that the preferred group of provisions was in fact ""the Clinton plan,"" most members of the panel changed their minds and opposed it. They knew, after all, that Clinton's plan could never work.",JANUARY 1995 ISSUE
Why Medicare Costs Are Growing Faster Than Other Healthcare - The Atlantic,2417,"One of the commenters offered a retort that I've seen in a bunch of places:  ""Of course Medicare is growing faster!  It cares for a sicker population!"" It's a common intuition, but it's wrong.  Consider a simple model of a population with two groups:  young and old.  Assume that the old consume five times as much of an undifferentiated good, healthcare, as the young do, and that each unit costs $2,000.  So the oung cost us $2,000 apiece per year, and the old cost us $10K.  Now assume that the cost of healthcare in each group grows at 10% a year.  At the end of five years, each young person will cost us $3,221 and each old person will cost us $16,105--or exactly five times as much as a young person. In other words, the fact that old people consume more healthcare than young people explains why the absolute difference in dollar amount of spending gets bigger over time.  But it doesn't explain why the rates of growth differ. Now, obviously ""healthcare"" is not a homogenous good.  So there are a bunch of different reasons that healthcare spending growth rates might differ.  We might get better at treating things that disproportionately happen to the elderly, causing the amount of healthcare they consume relative to the young to rise.  The cost of treating things that the elderly disproportionately get might rise, causing the cost of their healthcare to rise relative to the young.  They might succeed in using political power to divert more treatment resources to themselves.  You can imagine a bunch of different factors. What is the truth of the matter?  Hard to say.  Certainly, mitigating against this explanation is the fact that prenatal care and organ transplants are two of the fastest growing medical cost centers.  On the other hand, so are cardiovascular and cancer.  But lots of people under the age of 65 have heart attacks and cancer--I'm not sure there's any good evidence that the relative incidence has changed.  On the other hand, active life expectancy is growing even faster than overall life expectancy, which is also growing pretty fast--and if those things don't reflect our getting better at treating the things that old people get, I'm not sure what does. Still, I think you have to admit that at best, there's no evidence for the proposition that a big American government program can control costs, and what evidence we have so far tends to tilt in the opposite direction.

Does Adverse Selection Really Apply To Healthcare? - The Atlantic,5382,"I'm afraid we're all just going to have to adjust to the fact that it's going to be All Healthcare, All the Time until the August recess. So:  onto adverse selection. Adverse selection is the idea that information asymmetries in markets can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.  Say 30% of all used cars are lemons that will cost you a fortune to repair.  A new car is worth $10,000 while a good used car is worth $5,000, but a lemon is only worth $1,000, because of the repairs. The problem is, you can't tell which cars are lemons.  So you won't be willing to pay $5,000.  You might be willing to pay more like $3,500, which compensates you for the risk.  But the owners of the good cars will not wish to sell them at such a steep discount.  The owners of the crap cars, however, will leap at the chance to unload them for such a great price.  The percentage of lemons in the market goes up to 50%.  You demand a bigger discount to compensate you for the higher risk; now you'll only pay $2,500.  More owners of high-quality used cars decide to keep them rather than buy a new one.  The percentage of lemons rises to 70% . . . You can see where this is going.  And, presumably, how it might apply to insurance markets:  you end up with a pool of very sick people who cost a lot to cover.  This (along with a lavish schedule of mandatory benefits) is arguably why health insurance in New York State costs so much. Adverse selection is a favorite explanation of why markets for health care can't work, and health care therefore needs to be provided by the government.  Often, the proponents of this theory add a wrinkle:  insurance companies spend huge amounts of money on trying to keep from treating people. Alex Tabarrok points out a hole in this theory: Henry Farrell voices the objection that immediately occurred to me. But on reflection, I think Henry and I were wrong.  I was very surprised to follow through to the table Alex Tabarrok links (from the Kaiser foundation, hardly a right-wing advocacy group) and find out that the percentage of the uninsured* who are in ""fair"" or ""poor"" health really isn't much larger than the percentage of the insured in those categories:  10.3% of the uninsured, versus 8.4% of the insured. That is surprising because we would expect the uninsured to be sicker than the general population, even if the insurance companies were doing nothing to weed out the sick.  Being uninsured is correlated with other things that are strongly correlated with poor health:  being born in another (poorer) country; being too sick to work full time; little education; low SES. Of course, it's also true that the population of the uninsured is correlated with something that's also correlated with good health:  being young.  But then, this sort of undercuts the adverse selection argument, and also the moral imperative of giving them health insurance.  If you could reasonably afford health insurance by dropping down to a lower-priced cell phone plan and cutting back on your bar tab, you are not a national emergency. So for the nonce, let's ignore all those confounding factors, and assume that without virulent machinations by the insurance companies, the population of the uninsured ought to mirror the population of the insured in health status.  How many people are being pushed out of the insurance market because of their poor health status?  It can't be many; there are only 4.6 million people without health insurance who report poor or fair health status.  And not all of those people are very sick.  I'd be hard pressed to call my health better than fair because of my asthma and my Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.  But neither of those diseases costs my insurance company, or me, much. If there were no evil insurance companies involved, what would those percentages look like?  A slightly higher percentage of the insured market would report fair health, and a slightly lower percentage of the uninsured market.  But the difference would be less than 1 million people: 0.3% of the US non-elderly population, and 0.2% of the total population. What this means is that even if this is a problem, it is not a big problem.  You don't gut rehab the US health system because of a ""market failure"" affecting a small fraction of one percent of the population. Of course, as Alex notes, that doesn't mean that uninsured sick people aren't a problem.  But as both he and Tyler have pointed out, they seem more likely to be a distributional problem than a market failure.  In other words, the problem is not that the market cannot provide them insurance; the problem is that they don't have the money to buy it. This seems meaningless, a distinction without a difference, to most people.  But in fact, distributional problems and market failures call for very different kinds of solutions.  You fix distributional problems with cash or vouchers.  You fix market failures with regulation or some other form of intervention. Now, arguably, there could be a market failure that is being fixed by existing government interventions:  regulations preventing insurance companies from ripping off customers; government programs to cover the indigent, which take care of those who have become too sick to work.  But I have to agree with Alex; the empirical data does not seem to back up the notion that there is a large and persistent selection problem in current markets.

How America Reduced Health Care Spending by $2 Trillion - The Atlantic,4635,"The early days of the Obama administration were a chaos of uncertainty, between the historic housing bust, historic market crash, and historic armada of stimulus. But one thing was clear about the U.S. economy in 2008 going forward: Healthcare would keep on keeping on, in its insatiable way, adding more jobs, soaking up more tax dollars, and demanding a growing share of an American family's budget. In the worst recession in 80 years, it was the one industry that seemed truly recession-proof. But these days, we're grappling with an interesting and opposite puzzle, one that is equally without precedent. The housing market is re-inflating, the stock market is up, and the stimulus has faded. But healthcare growth is—temporarily? permanently?—slowing down. Before we get to the question marks, some context: In early 2009, healthcare employment had grown 22 percent since the day President George W. Bush took office in 2001. In that same time, overall employment had grown zero percent. Ze-ro. This discrepancy was among the more dramatic symptoms of growing healthcare costs. As debt piled up, Washington forecasters projected a not-so-distant future when Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security would exceed all collected tax revenues. Even less lugubrious projections agreed that healthcare spending was just totally out of control, and this was even before some predicted that the Affordable Care Act (or, more commonly: Obamacare) would hasten the country's medical bankruptcy. Meanwhile, five years after the passage of Obamacare, reality has intervened. Healthcare job growth fell throughout the Great Recession and has continued to fall, then stagnate, and then fall again. The labor market's runaway horse is clearly getting tired. The deceleration of healthcare employment matches the slowdown in medical costs. After a roller-coaster ride through the last quarter of the 20th century, healthcare inflation looks like it's pumping the brakes to park near the 2 percent line, the lowest mark since the year Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law: 1965. Growth in Medical Care Costs: Annual Percent Change With slowly growing prices, even rising demand for healthcare has led to less-than-projected spending, in just about every category. (To be clear: This doesn't mean healthcare is getting cheaper; it means healthcare is getting more expensive slower than we anticipated.) The government is casually saving hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare thanks to both direct cuts and other reforms. Insurance companies, despite a rough year due to the arrival of some expensive new drugs, have been spending less than the actuaries projected in 2010. Even with growth in high-deductible plans, out-of-pocket spending is actually coming in below projections from five years ago. Forecasts of medical spending have undergone round after round of major surgery. Six years ago, the Urban Institute projected that the country would spend $23 trillion between 2014 and 2019. After Obamacare became law, it raised its forecast by half-a-trillion dollars. But the latest projections, published this month, are lighter by $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively. That leaves healthcare's $2 trillion question: What's going on exactly? Just about everybody agrees that the answer is ""the recession and ..."" followed by a smattering of variables, such as cost control measures in Obamacare, the rise of high-deductible plans, and reforms undertaken by doctors and insurance companies, independently, to curb over-treatment. It's strange to think that the recession, which technically ended in 2009, would still have its fingers around the neck of medical cost growth in 2015. But as you can see if you scroll back up to the second chart in this article, healthcare costs tend to follow the rest of the economy with a bit of a lag; prices were still decelerating years after the 1980s and 1990s recessions were over. There might even be signs that the slowdown is entering a new phase: Healthcare employment ticked up in the first quarter of 2015. It's too early to predict how Obamacare will shape the U.S. healthcare system in the decades to come, especially given the upcoming Supreme Court decision. But as the U.S. enters the last quintile of Obama's term, the administration presides over a surprising historical moment. This was always going to be the Healthcare Presidency. But it wasn't obvious, even to the best actuarial oracles around, that the president who did the most to grow the government's role in healthcare since 1965 would preside over the period of slowest-growing healthcare spending since ... 1965.","APRIL 17, 2015"
Why American Health Care Is So Much Worse Than Europe's - The Atlantic,5576,"On the heels of the Senate’s latest attempt at replacing the Affordable Care Act, the Commonwealth Fund has released its latest evaluation of what, exactly, ails the U.S. health-care system. Once again, the think tank found the U.S. medical system performed the worst among 11 similar countries, all while spending more. The United States fared especially badly on measures of affordability, access, health outcomes, and equality between the rich and poor. The United Kingdom ranked first, and the other countries in the comparison were Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Germany, Canada, and France. America does perform well, comparatively, when it comes to doctor-patient relationships, end-of-life care, and survival rates after major issues like breast cancer or strokes. However, the United States does less well on measures of population health: It had high rates of infant mortality and a low life expectancy at 60 years. It also has the highest rate of “mortality amenable to health care”—deaths that doctors and hospitals can prevent—and has experienced the smallest reduction in that measure in the past decade. The ways to fix these issues, according to Commonwealth Fund experts, are to increase the rate of insurance coverage and access to primary care, streamline the insurance system so that there are less administrative hurdles for doctors, and funnel more money toward better nutrition and housing, rather than specialty care. On a call with reporters, experts from the think tank said they had not yet had a chance to closely examine the revised Senate health-care bill. But it is rather similar to the past Republican repeal-and-replace proposals, especially with approach to Medicaid. The new bill would allow insurers to sell health plans that charge sick people more, cover only some health problems, or deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, as long as they also sell Obamacare-compliant plans. The bill would also make cuts to Medicaid, the health-insurance program for the poor. A score for this bill from the Congressional Budget Office is expected next week, but the agency’s previous estimate was that 22 million Americans would lose coverage under a plan like this. “In general, the proposals we’ve seen would reverse the progress, especially on insurance coverage,” said Eric Schneider, senior vice president for policy and research at the Commonwealth Fund, on the call. “We suspect that alone would be taking us in a direction different from the solutions. The disparities we observe related to income would likely not get better under Medicaid cutbacks.” As insurance coverage declines, the Commonwealth Fund authors say less access to primary care would make American health outcomes even worse. The Senate bill would also expand the use of health savings accounts—a way of paying insurance premiums before taxes are taken out—which Commonwealth Fund president David Blumenthal said only adds to the “complexity” of American insurance. Simplifying insurance, meanwhile, could make it better. For example, American doctors spend a comparatively abnormal amount of time on “getting patients needed medications or treatment because of coverage restrictions,” the Commonwealth Fund finds, and having patients who are signed up for plans that don’t cover certain conditions or procedures, or that demand high deductibles from them before care is provided, would not remedy that. But, according to this report, a single-payer system is not necessarily the only way to go. One of the top performers in the Commonwealth Fund’s model is the Netherlands, a country where insurers are predominantly private companies who sell their plans to customers, many of whom are subsidized by the federal government. In other words, it looks like Obamacare on steroids. In the Netherlands, insurance is considered a social service, and it’s much more heavily regulated than in the United States. People are required to buy insurance, just like under Obamacare, and so less than 1 percent of the population is uninsured. (The Senate bill would eliminate the individual mandate.) Premiums are funded in part through payroll taxes and in part through subsidies that much of the population receives, according to a 2009 paper by Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost. The list of essential benefits is generous and also regulated by the government. Rather than allow insurers to pick only the healthiest customers to insure, the Dutch government redistributes the risk among insurers by making those with healthier risk pools pay into a pot of money that other, less fortunate insurers can draw from. Dutch people all pay a deductible of around $500, and unlike in the United States, providers there aren’t allowed to balance bill if insurance doesn’t fully cover their services. What’s more, primary-care doctors provide after-hours care, which helps explain why 77 percent of Dutch people say they “saw a doctor or nurse on the same or next day the last time they needed medical care.” Granted, the Dutch government has faced the typical health-care quandaries—like how to control costs while giving people access to the procedures they need—but at least according to this report, they are doing much better than the United States is. It serves as a counterpoint to the popular view, among some liberals, that you must have single payer for good health care. You do, however, need to get almost all of your population insured and treat insurers more like public utilities than free-wheeling upstarts.","JULY 14, 2017"
Can Vermont's Single-Payer System Fix What Ails American Healthcare? - The Atlantic,13771,"The Affordable Care Act's turbulent implementation has ruled the news cycle, but across the country states like Vermont are experimenting with their own plans. Governor Peter Shumlin signed a revolutionary single-payer plan, Green Mountain Healthcare—the culmination of decades of work by progressive politicians in the state—into law in May 2011. The new system aims to guarantee universal insurance coverage, improve benefits for those who are currently underinsured, include universal dental care and vision care, and increase the Medicaid reimbursement rate to doctors in order to avoid cost-shifting. In some ways, the system resembles the ACA, but the the most consequential difference is that Vermont’s law will end employer-provided insurance. ""God didn’t create the fact that employers are responsible for healthcare for their employees,"" says Bernie Sanders, the state’s stalwart socialist senator. Yet that change has resulted in an echo of the problems Obamacare has faced in remaking the individual insurance market: Plenty of people aren’t happy about giving up existing insurance that they like. Meanwhile, there are still major question marks about how Vermont will pay for the plan, whether it can achieve the projected savings, and what might happen when an American state tries to import a European-style insurance program. If the ambitious Green Mountain Healthcare is a success, its backers say it will serve as a model for the rest of the nation—especially if the ACA doesn’t achieve full coverage and help bring costs down. Then, they say, statehouses around the nation will look to Montpelier for guidance. But first Vermont has to figure out how the plan is going to work. The program was designed by Harvard economist William Hsiao, who detailed the plain in a 2011 Health Affairs article. Hsiao projected the state would save 25.3 percent annually in total healthcare spending, lower household and employer healthcare spending, job growth, and higher economic output for the state. The savings would come from lower administrative expenses, reduced fraud and abuse, eliminating middlemen, malpractice reform, and governance improvements. These savings, about $4.6 billion over the first five years, would be plowed back into paying to cover the uninsured and expanding benefits and services leaving $2.3 billion in residual savings. The law also created the Green Mountain Care Board, an independent group charged with overseeing the law and ensuring quality. What the plan didn’t do is lay out how the state government would pay for its increased spending. But Vermont has already deviated from Hsiao’s blueprint. The state’s new tort-reform law is not as expansive as he had envisioned. The state is still working through the best system to raise revenues, and Shumlin has appointed a tax expert to work on some plans. Cost-containment pilot projects to reform payment and delivery systems recommended by the Green Mountain Care Board are beginning to roll out. The state has yet to finalize its proposals for raising revenues to fund the program, which the legislature will consider in 2015 and contract out the administrative duties through a competitive bidding process closer to 2017 when the plan is ready to implement. Complicating the revenue project, the plan’s cost is disputed. A University of Massachusetts study commissioned by the administration to determine the cost of the plan estimated Vermont would need to find $1.6 billion in new revenues to fund the plan in 2017. Though the state will end up paying much more, UMass’s study also estimated GMC would save $281 million between 2017 and 2019 by reducing administrative costs and slowing growth in costs. The new system would eliminate the myriad providers currently in the state, and instead enroll nearly all of Vermont’s citizens in GMC. The UMass study estimates that about 70,000 Vermonters, roughly 10 percent of the population, would continue to receive insurance from their employers, the Veterans Affairs Administration, or their federal government plan. GMC would supplement that insurance. Under Vermont’s existing system, individuals and their employers pay $2.2 billion each year, which will be reduced to just $332 million. Even with $249 million in federal funds for Medicaid, that leaves a $1.6 billion shortfall that must be made up with increased government revenues. And that’s the more conservative estimate. A recent report by Avalere, a healthcare advisory company, commissioned by Vermont Partners for Health Care Reform, a confederation of hospital, insurance, and business groups, found the UMass study may have understated the cost of the plan and estimates the state will need between $1.9 and $2.2 billion in new revenues. The Avalere report uses different assumptions for administrative savings and payment rates, arguing that the UMass estimate—that GMC will pay 105 percent of Medicare rates—may be too low and would drive providers to leave the state. “The good news about the Avalere report is even if you take their assumptions, it still shows that we can cover everyone, bring everyone up to a better on-average benefit level as what they have today and spend the same or less money,” says Robin Lunge, Vermont’s director of healthcare reform. While the national individual health market is both viewed as inefficient by experts and wildly unpopular with most users, its overhaul has still caused uproar. That could be a bad omen for Vermont, which is upending the far more popular employer-sponsored healthcare system. But one of the advantages of Vermont’s small population may be a tolerance for disruption. “Vermont is a small state, says Sara Solnick, chair of economics at the University of Vermont. “There are very few degrees of separation so people are more willing to do something for everyone’s good for the good of the state.” Vermont’s plan is a bold experiment in whether the government can convince humans, naturally risk-averse, to drop their wariness about changes that might affect their access to healthcare. “At the national level we haven’t had that discussion because it’s politically impossible,” says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who worked with Hsiao during the early stages of the initiative, and who also worked on the Affordable Care Act and Massachusetts’ universal-coverage plan. “I am a fan of experimentation. We learned a lot experimenting with one model in Massachusetts and I think we can learn a lot experimenting with another model in Vermont.” While the bounds of the ACA were tightly circumscribed by political realities, Vermont—a state with a homogenous and reliably Democratic population—has more latitude. But even now, Gruber says the proposals are still protean: “There is no Vermont plan. There are Vermont ideas, but there is no Vermont plan.” That has led to major challenges on several fronts: medical providers, businesses, and most of all the general public. Darcie Johnston, a Republican political operative who runs Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, calls the GMC the largest tax increase in state history—even though taxes haven’t actually increased yet—and worries the cost-containment measures Hsiao and Shumlin counted on will fail and the savings will never materialize. She notes that the legislature failed to pass comprehensive tort reform (which accounted for 8 percent of the savings) and says she fears the plan will drive doctors to reduce care or even leave the state. Recent research suggests the fear may be unfounded. Doctors often threaten to opt out of Medicare, but few follow through. In Britain, where nearly all doctors and nurses are employed by the government, medical programs continue to attract students, even as other programs flounder. But the state’s business community—including groups that support reform—worries about the tax increases that will fund the plan. Sanders argues the new system will actually be a major relief to businesses, which will see an increased tax burden but won’t have to spend vast sums to paying for their employees’ insurance and administer the benefits. The plan amounts to a cost-shift. What businesses once paid in premiums, they will now pay in taxes. Hsiao forecast that cost per employee would drop nearly $1,900, from $2,228 to $332. The paradox of Vermont’s peculiar politics is that while perhaps only a small, homogeneous state could pass a plan like Green Mountain Care, there are also challenges a single state faces in implementing it that a nation would not. Single-payer can work at the national level, but what about Vermonters who work over state lines, or corporations based in other states doing business in Vermont? For the plan’s defenders, the best counterexample is to the north. “Canada’s healthcare system began as province-by-province initiative as well,” Lunge notes. “It started at Saskatchewan before becoming a national initiative.” And just as the Saskatchewan plan became a model for Canada, many in Vermont, including Sanders, hope the state’s plan will eventually become an example for other states. “Americans want to see a model that works,” the senator says. “If Vermont can be that model it will have a profound impact on discourse in this country.” If Vermont can work through the legal, technical, and administrative complications, it will be easier for others to follow. Lunge told me legislators in other states have called to ask about the system. “There are a number of states that have expressed interest. They have said to me that if ‘you figure this out, that will give us an opportunity,’” she says. Vermont Health Connect, the state’s insurance exchange, opened October 1 and faced problems similar to the federal government’s system. Since then, Vermont has managed to fix some of its flaws, though it has also criticized its contractor on the project. The launch is phased, so customers can currently choose a plan, but the payment function has not yet finished testing. The late launch of the payment system, which has been decried by critics, may be a symbol of the administration's willingness to work with small businesses and customers, who were unwilling to pay for health insurance they would receive in January in October. Either way, the next few months will be crucial, because all individuals and businesses with fewer than 50 employees have to obtain coverage through the exchange by March 31. Vermont’s enigmatic political preferences have baffled political scientists for decades. The state voted Republican in every presidential election for over 100 years, the longest streak in history (1854 to 1963), and had no Democratic governors during that span. Now its home to the nation’s only socialist senator, and after Barack Obama’s home state of Hawaii, no state voted for the president by a larger margin. Arthur Woolf, an associate professor of economics at the University of Vermont, says the state “is very much like a Social Democratic Western European country,” both economically (because of its equality and prosperity) and demographically (because of its homogeneous population). So perhaps it’s not surprising that the state is also the first to explore a Canadian-style single-payer system. Sanders says, “When I was mayor of Burlington in 1981 we had a commission, we had a lot of discussion, we had town meetings, we brought in people from Canada.” That attempt came to naught, but 30 years later, a Democratic House, Senate, and governor and strong popular support produced a perfect opportunity to pass a major reform. But of course Vermont’s unique political system might make it hard for other states to replicate its single-payer system. Despite the setbacks for Green Mountain Care, the economic rationale for a single-payer system remains strong. The U.S. healthcare system is dreadfully inefficient and exists in its current condition largely because of path dependency, not its merits. In his seminal 1963 paper, “Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care,” Kenneth Arrow noted the features of the healthcare market that made laissez-faire untenable. The sector is rife with market failures—externalities, asymmetric information, time-inconsistent preferences, and principal-agent dilemmas. As Paul Krugman writes, “There are … no examples of successful health care based on the principles of the free market, for one simple reason: in health care, the free market just doesn’t work.” A 2012 Institute of Medicine report finds that the U.S. healthcare system wastes $750 billion each year. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found, “Among 34 OECD countries between 1990 and 2010, the U.S. rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized YLL [Years of Potential Life Lost] rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized years lived with disability rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for healthy life expectancy from 14th to 26th.” OECD countries pay half of what the U.S. does, in per capita terms, for better outcomes and universal coverage. If Vermont can slay the chimera of employer-based healthcare, governors across the nation will take notice. “The single-payer model is harder, it requires more change, but it also holds out more hope because it has the best opportunity to control costs and everyone wants to control costs,” Solnick says. The U.S. healthcare system is in dire need of reform. In a 1928 in Vermont, Calvin Coolidge declared, “I love Vermont because of her hills and valleys, her scenery and invigorating climate, but most of all because of her indomitable people. They are a race of pioneers who have almost beggared themselves to serve others.” His words seem prescient today.","DECEMBER 27, 2013"
What Are the Best Plans on Healthcare.gov? - The Atlantic,4983,"The world is glutted by economic research. How do you help people use it? Earlier this year, Grace Gee and Eugene Wang, two math undergraduates at Harvard, sorted though data recently released from health-insurance marketplaces opened under the Affordable Care Act. In the 34 states they examined, they distilled a disturbing trend: Between 2014 and 2015, the largest insurance company in every state increased premiums by more than 75 percent compared to smaller insurers. This effect didn’t seem to correlate with increased benefits for the consumer. “The largest insurance companies do not appear to be paying for higher medical costs per premium dollar versus smaller insurers in the reported experience period of 2013,” they found. Gee and Wang’s paper was published in a Cambridge-based journal, Technology Science, and it’s since been cited in Congressional testimony. But wait! You, the reader, know their finding implies bad things. Yet already your eyes are glazing over—health insurance is important, and you maybe even buy it through Healthcare.gov or a state-level exchange—but this kind of macro-level finding is difficult to include in your insurance comparisons. Are you even buying from a “large” company? If so, is your company even part of the trend? Gee and Wang anticipated this problem, and they did what any two STEM-inclined Harvard-trained Millennials would do. They made a startup. Their company, HoneyInsured, launched last week. In its current form, it’s a website that ties into the Healthcare.gov back-end API, meaning that consumers can order insurance from it like they would the government’s more famous site. There are more than 52 of these “web brokers,” as the government calls them, independent sites and companies that mirror Healthcare.gov functions. Many of these brokers tout their simplicity: Instead of asking people a lot of questions upfront, they only ask about the information absolutely needed. (Over the past two years, Healthcare.gov has adopted a similar tack.) HoneyInsured is unusual in that it recommends a health-insurance plan at the end of that process. This suggestion takes Gee and Wang’s research into account. It’s also alone among web brokers, Gee said, in displaying the size of a plan’s network. (Like Healthcare.gov, HoneyInsured can also check to see if specific doctors you already use are included in the plan.) But HoneyInsured has other features that might make it more appealing to a comparison shopper. On its page of suggested plans, it tells you how much you would additionally pay out of pocket under a plan for certain ailments, like a broken limb, depression, and cancer. It also sorts plans by different kinds of medical costs: If most of your medical costs are via drugs, HoneyInsured finds a plan with a less expensive drug co-pay. “We have a currency type of calculation trade-off so if you prefer lower risk, we can find you a plan that has a lower max out-of-pocket and deductible,” Gee told me. And in a feature that mirrors the popular travel site Hipmunk, it plots all plans available to a buyer on a two-dimensional graph, with deductible vs. premiums. This lets buyers emphasize what they would prefer, and it avoids a common pitfall where “a plan [is] worse off than another in terms of deductibles and max out of pocket, but may just be a dollar cheaper.” What originally got Gee and Wang interested in health insurance was the amount of data there. “A lot of ACA data has been open since it started, but it hasn’t been put together in a real reusable format,” she said. “We got the data, we wrote the paper on it, and now we wrote the website based on that data.” HoneyInsured will take a commission for selling insurance. Gee told me commissions aren’t factored into the algorithm that suggests plans for users. She also said that user data was temporarily stored and encrypted on its servers before being sent to Healthcare.gov, and that then it was deleted. HoneyInsured is open now to users in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Missouri. This year, more companies than ever before are “web brokers” for the Department of Health and Human Services—hooking into its API and presenting it under a different interface. Popular web brokers include HealthSherpa and GetInsured. Though it may seem like many in government would oppose this trend, they tend to support it. In the future, many open-government advocates see running the API as the government’s role, and running actual interfaces as the role of private developers and companies. Startups and supporters of open government imagine a world where the government handles data and programming calls, but where private companies make the interfaces to access them. (Healthcare.gov would continue to function as a basic marketplace.) That will allow for many overlapping interests and priorities to factor into web design—presenting an opening for other research-based companies like HoneyInsured.","NOVEMBER 9, 2015"

The Largest Healthcare Fraud Takedown in U.S. History - The Atlantic,1185,"In what the Justice Department is calling the largest takedown of healthcare fraud in U.S. history, federal authorities on Wednesday brought charges against 301 people for $900 million in false billings. Among those charged includes 61 doctors, nurses, and other licensed medical professionals who, among other crimes, allegedly committed money laundering, identity theft, and Medicare Part D pharmacy fraud. Across the country, 23 states and 36 federal districts coordinated with the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services to go after the alleged fraud schemes. The defendants allegedly submitted Medicare and Medicaid claims the Justice Department said “were medically unnecessary and often never provided.” Some of the defendants were paid kickbacks for providing information for fraudulent bills. At least 28 doctors were among those charged on Wednesday. Announcing the charges, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said: According to the Justice Department, federal authorities have now charged more than 2,900 people for $8.9 billion in false Medicare billings since the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which led the investigation, was launched in March 2007.","JUNE 22, 2016"
A Truly Astonishing Graph of the Growth of Health-Care Jobs in America - The Atlantic,1210,"Well, this caught my attention:
 Here's what that graph (via Brookings) says. In the last ten years, job growth in America's non-health-care economy has been dreadful. Just 2.1 percent total -- or barely 0.2 percent per year. (Yes, that's point-two percent annual growth.) In that time, the U.S. health care sector has grown more than ten-times faster than the rest of the economy, adding 2.6 million jobs.
 Let's pull back the lens to 1990 and take a picture. Take a look at the growth of health care employment (in red) and the decline in construction and manufacturing employment (in blue).
 According to the BLS, the two fastest-growing jobs in the next decade -- by far -- will both be in health care: personal care aides and home health aides. I'd prefer not to muddy a clear statistical observation here with a provocative claim that health care's relentless, unstoppable employment growth is a good thing or a bad thing, exclusively, because it's certainly both -- an emergency source of recession-era employment and a symptom of health care inflation. I knew health care had been the most important driver of national employment over the last few years, but I had never seen the case made so starkly.

The 5 Mega-Trends That Are Changing the Face of Health Care - The Atlantic,9975,"No matter what the Supreme Court does with Obamacare, this industry, which consumes one-fifth of the U.S. economy, is already undergoing an overhaul As the nation's highest court weighs the fate of President Obama's health care reform legislation, it's important to keep one thing in mind: No matter what the nine justices ultimately decide, significant change is coming to health care -- and the industry's future is gaining clarity. Indeed, we see five key trends that are solid, foundational, and unassailable: (1) Strong headwinds will force change. The numbers say it all. Intense funding pressure on Medicare and Medicaid, decreasing commercial reimbursement, flat or declining volume trends, federal budget deficits, and growing uncompensated care--all of which are compelling the health care industry to adapt in a wholesale way. (2) Employer-based commercial insurance will undergo a shift. Whether it's an employer mandate or widespread exchanges, companies will have an entirely new relationship with employees when it comes to health care coverage. (3) Commercial payers will alter how they do business. They may be more collaborative in the rapidly emerging new world of health care, but they will also pay less. Some are employing a vertical integration strategy by getting into or enhancing their position in the provider segment. (4) Consumers will control more of their health care dollars. An increase in individual and high-deductible health plans will force consumers to be more active in their own health care and will lead to more consumer decision making. Providers will be required to adapt to increased demand for evidence-driven medicine and provide greater data and transparency. (5) Providers will be financially challenged. Quality through coordination and evidence-based medicine, not gatekeeping, is the answer. Put another way, better care will lead to better health, which will lead to lower costs. This transition from fee-for-service medicine will be wrenching--evidenced by recent practice closings and the growing trend toward consolidation. EMERGING MODELS As the sweeping transformation in health care takes hold, several models appear to be taking shape. Each has its strengths and weaknesses and each presents opportunities and risks, but the following three deserve serious analysis and represent different points on the risk spectrum: -- Bundled payments model: calculates total historical payments for the various components of a bundle and then discounts or at least holds constant that amount, placing the responsibility for cost and quality control in the hands of the collective providers. -- Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model: seeks to tie provider reimbursements to quality metrics and reductions in the total cost of care for an assigned population of patients. -- Capitation model: sends a fixed per-patient prepayment of premium dollars to a provider in return for medical services. Let's take a closer look at each. Bundled Payments. These are largely proven, but their track record in driving significant volumes has generally been marginal. Success is visible more clearly in terms of cost controls. Think of them as a middle ground between fee-for-service reimbursement and capitation. Nonetheless, bundled payments offer several important advantages: (1) Providers can benefit from cost savings from any payers included in the program. (2) Providers can derive enhanced volumes from private insurance and cash patients, who are drawn by the cost clarity and discounts. Medicare volume enhancement is driven by physician participation as well as patient desires. (3) Physicians and hospitals can develop tighter relationships as they seek to collaborate in this new way. (4) Silos get broken down--enhanced provider collaboration has been noted among specialties that are required to come together. (5) Greater coordination of care will likely lead to higher quality and more satisfied patients. (6) All payers will benefit from contracted case savings. The critical success factors to make bundled payments work, however, include appropriate episode selection, thorough and thoughtful bundle definitions, accurate cost analysis, willing and committed partners, and the infrastructure to manage the process. ACOs. For their part, ACOs are hardly proven, but in theory they should achieve results. The overarching idea is to get patients who aren't being treated in a coordinated manner into a system that can deliver care more effectively. The upsides to ACOs are: (1) Physicians and other professionals have an opportunity to reap financial benefits of efficiency driven by quality. (2) Hospitals that get involved can partially make up for declining volumes associated with higher quality and efficiency. (3) Patients currently accessing services in a disjointed manner are likely to have a better overall health care experience in a coordinated system. (4) Quality is likely to be enhanced because of coordination and aligned incentives. (5) Providers will likely increase collaboration. Existing risk-bearing organizations can increase ""membership,"" and many have already developed at least a portion of the infrastructure and have experience managing risk. The ACO model, if more broadly accepted, could have a major impact on hospitals, especially because the overall goals here are to reduce unnecessary services and provide better overall health care, which would mean less traditional business for them. A prime issue is that costs--for labor, devices, supplies, equipment, and construction--aren't addressed. And the Affordable Care Act exacerbates this situation by creating additional taxes, such as those levied on device manufacturers and payers, that will be passed through to purchasers. Indeed, we're already seeing tax and fee pass-through language cropping up in standard language from some managed care health plans. Continued passing of the cost problem from one entity to another isn't the answer, and this reality exhibits a major problem not addressed in the legislation. For hospitals, the solution lies in changing their business model. That means forging enhanced relationships with physicians; owning outpatient ancillary services, perhaps in conjunction with physicians; employing physicians; creating joint ventures with physicians; and fostering more than a low-level interest in primary care. To implement some of these changes, hospitals must take advantage of the positive business aspects of the current model while altering their strategic direction by being as efficient as possible now to retain valuable financial resources while they explore innovative options for the future. They should also identify the key physician organizations in their market and start talking about the potential collaboration needed for success. Those in particularly fragmented markets have a special opportunity to enhance their business model. There are a host of factors critical to an ACO's success, including adequate breadth of network; administrative, clinical, and IT infrastructure; a clinical staff versed in care management; experience managing risk; and strong data that helps with population health management. Capitation. Deploying this approach requires deep expertise on a number of levels. But the capitation model could be part of the health care solution, because payments remain largely the same, regardless of how many services or what type of services each patient actually receives. Capitation offers a number of other positives as well: (1) Provider organizations can gain greater sustainability, control over their own destiny, and enhanced business possibilities--all of which complement the accountability this model requires. (2) Organizations find themselves centering their efforts around proactive long-term health management -- rather than quick short-term bottom-line ""wins"" -- to realize profitable gains. (3) It aligns incentives for provider organizations. It fosters coordination, quality, and financial responsibility. To reap these rewards, however, organizations must grapple with a series of critical success factors. Among the must-haves: a provider network with adequate breadth and depth, appropriate funding, a large enough membership complement, sophisticated care coordination systems, providers vested in the success of the entity or model, sufficient administrative support and physical infrastructure, a culture of high quality, and proper leadership. Not surprisingly, these are the same characteristics a successful ACO will have. Good business discipline is also required: strategic planning; mentorship and succession planning; business modeling and forecasting based on actuarial projections; IT infrastructure; knowledgeable, experienced administrative staff; and effective contractual relationships and communication mechanisms with outside providers. A decent measure of risk is associated with capitation too. Health care costs have been out of control for a long time, and as a result many organizations are reluctant to work with finite financial resources to achieve stated goals. That said, the time could be right for capitation. DECISIONS, DECISIONS Health care's future is being formed well beyond the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. Sure, the industry is being forced to find new ways to cope with declining reimbursement and other challenges, but it's also trying to deliver better care models, no matter what ends up being decided with regard to the Affordable Care Act. The industry is clearly changing, and the process can't--and won't--be reversed. Provider organizations now must decide which model makes the most sense for them and take proactive steps to stay ahead of the health care curve. This is important, because the key trends and emerging models show us that providers, payers, and patients--not judges--will be the players who determine the future of health care in America in the years and decades to come. ><","MAY 9, 2012"
A Shining Example of Healthcare That Works: Home Visits for Asthmatic Kids - The Atlantic,3066,"A study of the Community Asthma Initiative found that the seemingly expensive program more than paid for itself in reduced ER visits and hospitalizations.
 A program developed in Boston has the potential to make asthma a lot less troublesome for children all over the country. Targeted to children in low-income families, the program substantially lowered emergency room visits, hospitalizations and school days missed due to asthma. A key part of the program is a visit to the child's home by a nurse or other health care worker to make the home less likely to trigger asthma attacks. And according to a recently published study, the program pays for itself. About 10% of U.S. children have asthma. This rate is much higher in many low-income areas. To help address this problem, clinicians at Children's Hospital in Boston developed a program called Community Asthma Initiative (CAI) in 2005. Using hospitalization and emergency department logs, 283 low-income children with asthma were identified and then enrolled. The program starts by assigning each child a nurse as their case manager. But its centerpiece is a visit to the child's home. There's a lot of territory covered during the home visit. A nurse or other health care worker assesses the home for asthma triggers and begins making arrangements to eliminate or reduce them. Dust, mold, mice and cockroaches are all known triggers for asthma attacks. Pest control, HEPA vacuums and encasements for bedding are some of the tools the nurse/case manager has to fight back with. The nurse or health care worker also makes sure that parents and children understand the basics of managing asthma, including how to properly take their asthma medication and what to do in case of an unexpected asthma attack. On average, each family received 1.2 home visits during the year-long program. And the effects were dramatic. In the year after enrolling in the program, there was a 68 percent decrease in ER visits for asthma and an 85 percent decrease in hospitalizations due to asthma. Missed school days dropped by 41 percent and missed workdays of parents needing to care for their children dropped by 50 percent. And days where children had to limit their physical activity because of asthma decreased 43 percent. All of these improvements were evident within six months. The goal of the published study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CAI. Comparisons with similar communities not served by the program suggest that the program saved $146 for every $100 that was spent on it. The program cost $2,825 per child but the savings from reduced hospitalizations and ER visits came to $3,827 per child. In other words, the program more than paid for itself. It's hard to put a dollar figure on just how much it's worth when sick children become healthy again. According to the study, that's what CAI and programs modeled after it can do for children with asthma. An article on the study was published online by Pediatrics.

"Fixing Healthcare, Part Two: The Path to a New Healthcare System - The Atlantic",629,"The goals of reform are clear: provide universal care that is affordable.  So far, however, Congress has avoided any proposals that would require a major organizational shake-up--tabling Senators Wyden (D-OR) and Bennett's (R-UT) ""Healthy Americans Act"" (""Wyden-Bennett""), because it would eliminate employer-based healthcare as we now know it. 
 
Conceptually, the most obvious way to achieve universal care without eliminating existing employer policies is through a voucher--plus an exchange where the voucher can be traded in.  Employers would be free to top up the voucher and provide a more generous plan if they wanted to.","AUGUST 6, 2009"
Experts Say Healthcare.gov Could Be Hacked - The Atlantic,7111,"Cyber security experts are prepared to slam government officials over the embattled Obamacare website during today's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hearing on its ""own security concerns about healthcare.gov,"" citing vulnerabilities they think make the site easy to hack. David Kennedy, the head of security consulting firm TrustedSec, told Reuters that he and others identified 20 weak points on healthcare.gov that the government has not yet resolved, even though the warning was issued months ago. According to Kennedy, the problems with the site make it susceptible to a number of security breaches. Users could see their personal information stolen by thieves, their data modified or their personal computers attacked. Hackers could also mess with the site's already fragile infrastructure. In November, Kennedy testified with three other experts on the site's security during a Science Committee Hearing. Three out of the four witnesses said the site was so vulnerable to attack that it should be shut down. Kennedy has conducted ""passive analysis"" of healthcare.gov — which means he didn't hack into the site himself — to conclude that it would be easy to steal user information. Reuters reports: Still, some say that experts who have not hacked into the site are all just speculating on security concerns.  The cyber security weaknesses are likely to be the second embarrassment for healthcare.gov this week. The government launched a Spanish-language website of the site, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, in December of last year — months after healthcare.gov — and the Associated Press reported on Sunday that users are not pleased with the ""Spanglish"" site: According to the AP, the awkward site has likely discouraged Spanish speakers from signing up for health care. A New Mexico Spanish professor said that the site reads as a computer-generated translation of the English: One woman reported calling the Spanish-language healthcare hotline after signing up online proved too complicated. She was told to call back because the site was down, but never got hold of service representative. ""I've spent at least one week on the phone, and I couldn't get it done,"" she told the AP through a translator. Various states have reported few registrations through the Spanish language site. In California, where roughly 4.3 million residents speak only Spanish, only up to 5,500 people signed up for Obamacare in October and November. Between security and language problems, the healthcare.gov re-rollout is disappointing, and makes us wonder when — if ever — the government will get the Affordable Care Act snags worked out. Update: The HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reached out to The Wire with a statement in response to Kennedy of TrustedSec's analysis of healthcare.gov. They write: CMS also offered a statement on the Spanish-language site, noting: They add:  See their full statement below: CMS Statement on TrustedSec: CMS takes seriously any legitimate concerns about the security of the website.  We have a robust system in place to quickly investigate and address any potential vulnerabilities.  We respond appropriately to anyone who contacts us with information about potential vulnerabilities or incidents.  Because this individual had no direct access to the operations of thehealthcare.gov website, the information in the report is based on assumptions, not direct knowledge of the website. To date, there have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site. Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best practices to appropriately safeguard consumers’ personal information. The security of the system is also monitored by sensors and other tools to deter and prevent any unauthorized access such as regular penetration testing and continuous monitoring of computer systems. As part of the ongoing testing process, and in line with federal and industry standards, any open risk findings are being appropriately addressed with risk mitigation strategies and compensating controls.  There are currently no open high risk findings for the FFM. The components of the HealthCare.gov website that are operational have been determined to be compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), based on standards promulgated by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and promulgated through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Background from CMS officials: The report includes the following disclosure statement: “Information contained in this report was obtained through passive analysis of readily available information. Under no circumstance did TrustedSec conduct any type of “hacking” efforts or attempt to exploit any weaknesses in thehealthcare.gov web site.” Background from CMS officials on Spanish language website: ·         Terminology is standardized using a CMS-produced translation “glossary” of terms.  These terms are based on accepted industry standards, feedback and recommendations from advocacy organizations and other Federal partners, consumer feedback (both unsolicited and through targeted research), and consistency with other Federal products. ·         As an example, “prima” has long been the Spanish term used for all Spanish materials and web content for Medicare beneficiaries.  Based on studies and the Spanish Dictionary of the Real Academia Española, it is used to explain premium (an amount of money given first or an amount of money given to stimulate operations in addition to a standard price or rate. It is also known as an amount that the insured pays the insurer) www.rae.es   The word has proven to be better understood by the majority of Hispanics.  It is also used ·         by other federal agencies (SSA, IRS) and we aim for consistency. Univision also uses “prima” in its Marketplace glossary (attached). ·         On CDS.gov, where we must link to information that isn’t available yet in Spanish, such as the anonymous shopping tool, we always include an “en inglés” identifier to alert users that the language is changing. ·         In some areas that display content generated by a database that uses content health plans enter about their plans, there is an unavoidable mix of Spanish and English content.  Health insurers are not required to supply their plan information in Spanish and the Plan Comparison tool on CuidadodeSalud.gov can display only the plan information that is available in the database. ·         In every language, there are different opinions about terminology and word choice.  We are committed to ongoing improvements in our content when they increase understandability. Sometimes, as with any website or other product, there are typos or errors – when we become aware of them and confirm them, we work to get them corrected. ·         The translation of CuidadodeSalud.gov is a collaboration between several in-house translators and employees of contracted translation companies.  We do not use automated translations.","JANUARY 16, 2014"
How Health Care Can Stop Amplifying Racism - The Atlantic,9571,"About the authors: Ezekiel J. Emanuel is an oncologist, a bioethicist, and a vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author or editor of 10 books, including Brothers Emanuel and Reinventing American Health Care. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, with joint appointments in the Perelman School of Medicine, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. She served as president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation from 2003-2017. The coronavirus pandemic didn’t create the health disparities among Americans, but it has exposed once again how stark the problem is. Black and Latino patients are two to three times as likely as white patients to be diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than four times as likely to be hospitalized for it. Black patients are more than twice as likely to die from the virus. They also die from it at younger ages. COVID-19 has exacerbated long-standing trends: Black and Latino Americans have lower rates of insurance coverage, a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, worse health outcomes, and a lower life expectancy. People in the health-care world sometimes speak of these patterns as if they are inevitable facts of life—something the industry is powerless to change. More doctors and hospitals need to acknowledge and address how the U.S. health-care system is rife with structural racism. For decades, American medicine has discriminated against people of color. The health-care system, by one estimate, is responsible for only about 10 to 15 percent of preventable mortality in the United States. Socioeconomic factors, such as housing, food, and education, have a greater overall impact. Policies that effectively address these factors will be required to significantly reduce disparities in health outcomes for Black and Latino people. Nevertheless, many choices that health-care professionals commonly make—such as not accepting Medicaid patients, having fewer staff members at facilities in minority neighborhoods, and blaming patients for not taking their medicine and for poor overall outcomes—perpetuate disparities and even amplify them. Read: How to fix the health gap between Black and white America These health gaps are not immutable. Concrete changes to public policy, industry practices, and medical education could turn the health-care system into a force for greater equality. Here are five such changes: First, when states are indifferent to whether their Black and Latino citizens have health coverage, the federal government should step in. According to research published earlier this year, 9 percent of white adults were uninsured in 2018, compared with 14 percent of Black adults and 25 percent of Latino adults. The coronavirus recession is making the coverage gap worse. Already, as many as 12 million Americans have lost insurance sponsored by their employer or a family member’s employer. Black, Latino, and other workers of color have faced especially steep declines in employment. The Affordable Care Act did reduce disparities in insurance by setting up insurance exchanges and making more Americans eligible for Medicaid, but some states opted out of the latter—with terrible consequences for disadvantaged minorities. Indeed, an estimated 46 percent of Black working-age adults live in the 15 states that refused to implement the ACA’s expanded Medicaid benefits, leaving low-wage workers with no way to pay for their family’s care. The disparity rises when joblessness grows: Medicaid covers 36 percent of unemployed adults in states that expanded eligibility for the program, but only 16 percent in states that did not. So far, federal inducements have not been enough to persuade states such as Texas, Georgia, and Florida to expand Medicaid. The next president and Congress can solve that problem by federalizing Medicaid and removing its administration from states. Such a change could yield universal enrollment standards and greatly reduce the racial health-insurance gap. Second, policy makers can make insurance coverage meaningful by having Medicaid pay physicians and hospitals more. Having health coverage is necessary, but not sufficient, for patients to obtain good health care in a timely manner. Because Medicaid pays doctors less than Medicare or private insurance does, many doctors refuse to see—or delay appointments for—Medicaid patients. A 2014–15 survey showed that only 68 percent of family-practice physicians accepted new Medicaid patients, while 91 percent accepted those with private insurance. Some doctors did not accept new patients at all or didn’t accept insurance. Only a third of psychiatrists accepted new Medicaid patients. In 2013 and 2014, the ACA temporarily raised Medicaid payments to primary-care doctors. This fee bump improved patients’ access to doctors. Just as predictably, when states returned to lower fee levels, Medicaid enrollees had more trouble making appointments. The lesson is clear: The federal government needs to permanently raise Medicaid payments to doctors. For hospitals, payment reforms should penalize poor performance on measures of health equity. For example, higher payments to hospitals could be tied to improvements in emergency-room wait times—which have often been found to be longer for Black patients than white ones. Read: Medicaid’s dark secret Third, hospitals—which often anchor a community’s health-care system—must address social factors that affect health outcomes. Hospitals that do so could see benefits in the long run. In the mid-2000s, for example, Boston Children’s Hospital began a community-outreach program for low-income Black and Latino children who, based on previous information, seemed likely to be hospitalized with asthma. Case workers worked with families and community groups to reduce the prevalence of conditions that lead to asthma attacks. The result: Unnecessary readmissions, emergency-room visits, missed school days by students, and lost workdays among parents all fell. The program generated $1.73 in benefits for every dollar spent. At a variety of other hospitals, initiatives to address the social determinants of health have led to a fall in readmissions. The government has leverage over hospitals. In return for avoiding substantial federal and state taxes, nonprofit hospitals are required to provide community benefits. Many hospitals count discounted care to Medicaid and uninsured patients as community benefits. Instead, state and federal policies should specifically encourage hospitals to invest in community health—for instance, in anti-hunger programs or “nurse-family partnerships” that assist low-income mothers. Many hospitals also receive extra funds because they operate in low-income communities, make less money from private insurance, and provide a disproportionate share of their services to patients without the ability to pay. These government payments should be tied to investments that address social determinants of health. Fourth, increasing diversity among physicians and nurses is vital. In an experiment in Oakland, California, the researchers Marcella Alsan, Owen Garrick, and Grant C. Graziani found that the involvement of Black doctors could reduce the cardiovascular mortality gap between Black and white men by 19 percent. Yet only 5 percent of American physicians are Black, compared with 13 percent of the general population. Latino and Indigenous physicians are similarly underrepresented. Structural barriers, including the excessive cost of attaining a medical or nursing degree and bias in the admissions process, substantially contribute to this lack of diversity. Many states already offer loan-repayment services and other incentives for physicians to work in underserved areas, but expanding these programs could recruit even more underrepresented minorities to the medical field. Not all the obstacles to diversity are economic, of course. Minority students are also more likely to experience discriminatory comments and public humiliation during their medical training. Medical schools and hospitals need to enforce serious disciplinary measures for such behavior, while ensuring that students who complain are not labeled as “troublemakers.” Read: America’s health segregation problem Finally, all health-care workers could also benefit from a curriculum that specifically addresses implicit bias and the historical roots of racism in the medical system. To this day, medical textbooks still depict mostly white skin tones. Many medical students hold empirically false beliefs about race-based physiological differences—including the notion that Black patients have a higher tolerance for pain than white patients. These beliefs affect the kind of decisions that doctors make. One analysis early in the pandemic found that doctors were less likely to refer symptomatic Black patients for testing than they were to refer white ones. Educating aspiring doctors about these dynamics will improve the care that patients receive. These five steps won’t cure America’s health disparities, but they outline a course of action. Reducing racial bias in health care will have broad benefits: A country whose residents have fewer chronic conditions, better access to care, and longer lives has a greater capacity for happiness and prosperity. As America faces a national reckoning with structural racism, leaders in the health-care system must confront the role we play and assume responsibility for solving the problem.

The Immigrant Healthcare Imperative - The Atlantic,5436,"I didn't know much about my patient, a young man originally from Tibet, other than that he worked in a restaurant in Queens. For most of my patients, their coming-to-America story is an intrinsic part of their medical history. It's certainly medically relevant in terms of what diseases they might have been exposed to, what nutritional, environmental and genetic factors might play a role in their health, but it's also such a key part of who they are that it's usually a central part of our initial interview. But this patient was reticent, and I didn't push. He seemed to be a loner, self-sufficient, with a monk-like abstemiousness that made him seem older than 34. Without fail, he always arrived at the clinic with a container of fragrant Tibetan dumplings which he would press solemnly into my hands before I could begin the medical visit. These visits were not that frequent, since other than some acid reflux and low back pain he was quite healthy. One day he came to my office with a woman in her late fifties, whom he introduced as his mother. I was surprised and delighted to meet her because I had no idea that he had any family with him in this country. I'd envisioned him as a loner. He asked if I would look at a bump under her arm. I examined her axilla gingerly and was immediately met with granite resistance. My heart sank as I worked my fingers anteriorly over a bulging stony mass in her breast. ""How long has this been here?"" I asked, trying to keep the doom out of my voice. As my patient's story slowly unfurled from him I realized that there was so much I did not know about him. He was not a loner at all. He was married, with two young children. His parents lived with him, as well as an aunt. But no one was getting any medical care because they were undocumented and worried about deportation. I also learned the he didn't just work in a restaurant -- he'd started the restaurant himself, and now employed several other people. He'd been a journalist in Tibet until he managed to get to America on a student visa, now expired. He was the only one who spoke some English, so he was the one who ventured to the clinic. His reflux pills he gave to his father, who suffered from a gastric ulcer. The ibuprofen for his back went to his aunt, who had arthritis. And the ""bump"" under his mother's arm -- well that had been there for years, and it had indeed started out as only a bump. But she was too scared to come to the hospital -- she spoke almost no English and worried about deportation. Everyone in the family worked -- in the restaurant, cleaning houses, babysitting -- but none of these jobs offered means to obtain health care. And so the family stayed away. The mother's breast cancer was an insidious and implacable marker of time in the shadows. This story is sadly typical -- immigrants afraid to access basic medical care, potentially curable illnesses spiraling out of control. Communicable diseases -- easily treatable ones -- fester and spread unnecessarily. As immigration reform wends its way through a fractious and polarized House of Representatives, many are thinking about the implications for health care. From the medical perspective, bringing people into a primary care system is beneficial for our entire society, both from the public health standpoint and the moral standpoint. But even from the economic side, it makes sense. The savings from treating illnesses early, preventing outbreaks of communicable disease, screening for treatable chronic illnesses and vaccinating to prevent disease are entirely obvious. On a larger scale, however, immigrants' relative youth, health, and productivity are a boon to the medical system. A recent study showed that from 2002 to 2009 immigrants as a whole contributed an estimated $115 billion more to the Medicare trust fund than they took out. In 2009 alone, immigrants offered a surplus of nearly $14 billion, while U.S.-born people generated a deficit of more than $30 billion. Most of the surplus, incidentally, was from immigrants who were not citizens. This was felt to be from the higher proportion of working-age taxpayers in this demographic. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country. By all accounts, the vast majority of these immigrants would be here legally if it were logistically and financially possible. Bringing this swath of our country into institutional legitimacy would surely have some upfront cost. But the overall gain -- for the economy, for Medicare, for our nation's health -- would outweigh this handily. It would also help erase the moral stain of a nation built on immigrants now turning around and casting the next generation of immigrants as second-class citizens. I explained to my patient and his mother that we would treat her cancer promptly, that we were interested in her health, not her immigration status. I encouraged the rest of the family to come to the clinic and they did. For the older members of the family, it was the first medical care they'd had in years. The mother, sadly, died several months later. Her disease was too advanced for surgery or chemotherapy, but palliative care helped those months be more comfortable. As her physician, it pained me to know that her cancer might have been cured, even prevented, had she been able to access medical care sooner. But with immigration reform, her two grandchildren have a good chance of growing up healthier.","JULY 16, 2013"
Tom Price's Healthcare Agenda - The Atlantic,7062,"Donald Trump’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare began in earnest on Tuesday with the selection of House Budget Committee Chairman and six-term Georgia Representative Tom Price as the next secretary of Health and Human Services. Price has been one of the most consistent opponents of the Affordable Care Act in Congress, and has written perhaps the most comprehensive Republican alternative to the bill. That pick, along with the selection of the Indiana health-policy consultant Seema Verma to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, appears to signal that Trump is making his vision of healthcare reform a top priority. But what will Price actually be able to do at his new position? Both Price and Verma know healthcare well. Price, a physician, is not a neophyte in the vein of Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development, but a seasoned health-policy thinker who knows the minutiae of the major public-insurance programs and reforms. Verma, whose CMS will administer those programs, has previously worked closely with the agency as one of the architects of Mike Pence’s market-based Medicaid expansion in Indiana and of much of Indiana’s state health policy. Although Price’s selection is the clearest signal yet of the direction Trump intends for his replacement of Obamacare—defunding Obamacare subsidies, cuts to Medicaid, expanded high-risk pools, health savings accounts tax breaks, and continuous coverage requirements for pre-existing conditions waivers—now that he’ll be outside of Congress, Price won’t have the authority to simply end Obamacare on his own. Enacting his apparent preferences for diminishing public insurance for children and denying care for elderly people who can’t afford co-pays requires legislative authority. Until a bill comes along that changes the structure of the Affordable Care Act or dismantles it, Price cannot act unilaterally on his stated desires to end it. But Price can exercise some of the broad powers of the secretary’s office right away to make the ongoing effort to implement Obamacare more difficult, even if some of those provisions survive what is expected to be a rapid move in Congress to repeal it. For one, the text of the ACA was noted—and derided—for its thousands of references to the secretary of HHS in sections known as the “secretary shall” clauses, which placed quite a bit of the burden on the department itself to determine the final shape of several reforms. Among the reforms left in the purview of the department are the actual creation and maintenance of the HealthCare.Gov website, the establishment of federally run exchanges in recalitrant or struggling states, and the administration of the Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight, which is designed to implement the private-insurance reforms of the ACA. After a year that has seen large increases in premiums, the exit of major insurers from the exchanges, and a reluctance among young people to sign up for insurance, the Obama administration has leaned on this statutory authority to make fixes, including plans to recruit additional insurers and bolster outreach to young people. With exchanges in such a precarious position, Price’s department could choose not to pursue these additional reforms or simply cease improving and effectively administering exchange functions. One part of Obamacare that Price and Verma would have authority over on day one is the added branch of CMS designed to test and implement changes in the actual delivery of and payment for healthcare in the country. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation was established in the Affordable Care Act, and has been authorized to act as a grantor and innovation lab for different state plans to address some of the largest cost drivers in health. Price has been an outspoken critic of the innovation center, especially as it has experimented with shifting Medicare payments from fee-for-service to a value-based model that would not pay physicians on traditional volume metrics, but on a set of metrics emphasizing quality and efficiency. Price has expressed concern that these changes limit the discretion of physicians, and intrude into the doctor-patient relationship. One of the main populations of patients affected by these CMMI demonstration grants are “dual-eligibles,” or patients eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare—generally those at the intersection of old age, low-incomes, and often disabilities. The new HHS and CMS could roll back any potential patient gains or data gleaned from these projects. A lesser-known provision of the Affordable Care Act is its Section 1557, the nondiscrimination portion required by the Civil Rights Act, which applies to HHS’s authority even beyond the individual reforms of Obamacare. Price’s department has the authority to interpret that provision in its regulations. This year, under Secretary Sylvia Burwell, HHS used that rule to grant protections to transgender individuals and ensure that they could not be denied coverage or treatment on the basis of gender identity. Given Price’s objection to the Obama administration’s recent guidelines on bathrooms for transgender people, it seems likely his HHS might renege on the promise to transgender people. The Department of Health and Human Services also provides a significant portion of the funding that Planned Parenthood receives, and Price has been in favor of defunding the organization and making abortion illegal. As my colleague Olga Khazan notes, Price has been generally in favor of forcing women to pay copays for contraceptives as well. While Republicans in Congress seem likely to move the law in Price’s favor on both fronts anyways, it’s worth noting that in a few months, he will possess the main statutory authority to make independent decisions on both questions. It’s impossible to fully predict Price’s agenda in the department now because so much depends on Congress’s moves to enable that agenda. But only part of that agenda will revolve around the leviathan of Obamacare and its successor, and even beyond the public insurance programs that make up the bulk of its spending. HHS also administers the largest health-research centers in the world, most of the country’s public-health apparatus, the Indian Health Service, the Food and Drug Administration, and a collection of welfare and child-care services. While Price has a less-established policy record on many of these issues, his general philosophy of rolling back government spending and intervention suggests he may scale back HHS’s current efforts. What does seem clear, though, is that the department in charge of public insurance, insurance for children, delivery-system innovation, protecting transgender healthcare rights, and providing women’s health services will now be led by a man who wants to contract public insurance, voted against expanding children’s insurance, is against delivery-system reforms, and wants to remove the government from the business of providing protections and services for transgender people and women.","NOVEMBER 30, 2016"
Can Trump Save the Republican Healthcare Bill? - The Atlantic,5765,"Updated on March 7, 2017 at 7:29 p.m. ET A Republican alternative to Obamacare years in the making was on the verge of unraveling just a day after its introduction, as conservative lawmakers, advocacy groups, and industry leaders denounced it as an insufficient answer to the nation’s healthcare challenges. Party leaders in Congress and in the Trump administration held up the American Healthcare Act as the GOP’s long-awaited deliverance on its promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with “patient-centered” market reforms, hoping to pass the bill through the House and Senate within a matter of weeks. But by Tuesday evening, it wasn’t clear whether the legislation would ever make it to a floor vote, and it was far easier to find lawmakers and organizations who were against the bill than it was to find those in favor of it. Republicans in Congress were increasingly looking to President Trump to help lift their flagging legislation. Despite a full-throated endorsement from the president and personal lobbying from Vice President Mike Pence, however, conservatives urged the House leadership to set aside the new bill and instead vote on a straight-forward repeal of Obamacare. They criticized the proposal as “Obamacare Lite,” arguing that it created a new entitlement program in the form of tax credits for health insurance and maintained the current law’s Medicaid expansion and some of its tax increases. “We are united on repeal, but we are divided on replacement,” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky declared at an afternoon press conference. He stood alongside several members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and with Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who said the House bill was “a step in the wrong direction and as much as anything a missed opportunity.” The proposal’s supporters, however, were publicly unfazed. “Doing big things is never easy, but we have made a promise, and we are going to keep that promise,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said. He defended the bill as a dismantling of Obamacare and confidently predicted it would pass over conservative objections. “We will have 218 [votes] when this thing comes to the floor, I can guarantee you that,” Ryan said, referring to the threshold it would need to secure a majority in the 435-member chamber. (The actual threshold may be lower due to the five current vacancies.) At the White House, Trump was similarly upbeat as he met with the House GOP’s team of deputy whips responsible for shepherding the legislation to passage. “It’s a great bill,” the president said. “I really believe we’re going to have tremendous support. I’m already seeing it, not only from people in this room but from everybody.” It wasn’t clear if Trump was aware of the forces arraying against the proposal outside the White House. Democrats are expected to vote against the bill without exception. In addition to conservatives in Congress, Republican Governors John Kasich of Ohio, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, and Paul LePage of Maine were among those who criticized the measure. The conservative advocacy groups Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth, and the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity all denounced the bill. The American Hospital Association issued a letter of opposition from its president and CEO, Richard Pollack. In the Senate, a member of the Republican leadership, Roy Blunt of Missouri, voiced doubts that the bill could secure a majority in either chamber. Whether the initial opposition turns out to be a bump on the long road to passage or a fatal blow remains to be seen. The legislative process on Capitol Hill is almost always a roller-coaster, and that was never more true than when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act seven years ago. The law took more than a year to get through Congress, and it appeared dead after Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate early in 2010. On Tuesday, Republicans vowed to press ahead, and both the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committee will go forward with plans to mark up their legislation on Wednesday. Still, the intensity of the opposition on Tuesday was striking, and it appeared—at first glance—to explain why it took so many years for Republican leaders to embrace a detailed legislative alternative to Obamacare. The attacks arrived even before the Congressional Budget Office had a chance to fully assess the bill’s impact on the deficit and insurance coverage, which could become another flashpoint. Republicans were already anticipating, and preparing to rebut, a CBO projection that their bill would lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance. At points during the day, whether the new proposal was even open to further negotiation was a matter of debate. While the White House embraced the bill as its own, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, repeatedly declined to say whether the administration supported every aspect of it. The proposal, he said, was “a work in progress.” Later in the afternoon, members of the Freedom Caucus said they had been told directly by Pence that party leaders would be willing to negotiate changes. But by the evening, Trump began whipping the vote on Twitter. His first target was Paul. “I feel sure,” the president wrote, “that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!” The effort to pass the healthcare bill will be a defining battle for Ryan as well as Trump’s first major legislative test. Republicans were leaning on the president’s support and hoping that his popularity among the rank-and-file would bring conservatives onboard. After just one day, however, their chances of success seem increasingly in doubt.","MARCH 8, 2017"
"Healthcare Economics:  Standing Athwart History, Shouting ""Stop!"" - The Atlantic",2526,"I'm very interested to see Herb Stein's famous quote being invoked by liberals to talk about healthcare.  When Herbert Stein first said ""If something cannot go on forever, it will stop"" in 1980, he was arguing against people who were using scary charts mindlessly extrapolating some trend out to 100% of the total economy in order to demand immediate government action on a problem--in that case, the balance-of-payments problem. The problem with these extrapolations is twofold.  First, you definitionally cannot see the feedback systems that will probably mitigate the trend--all trends seem inevitable until they stop.  Think about the population explosion literature of the 1970s.  Now, in theory the people of the 1970s had a piece of information available to them that should have warned them that their charts were likely to be off:  to wit, that women in the wealthy West no longer averaged six or seven children apiece.  In practice, they were distracted from this data point by a lot of other factors, including their own racism. But also, especially in cases like this, we react inappropriately to future extrapolations, because we project them onto our own situations--we ignore the fact that the changes in income shares devoted to a given product arise from economic growth.  It is true that I cannot afford to spend 40% of my income on healthcare.  It was equally true that my great-great grandparents could not afford to spend a third of their income on housing, and another half on clothing, manufactured good, transportation, and services--Land o' Mercy, everyone in the future is going to starve to death!!! Obviously this is ridiculous.  I am not consuming less food than my ancestors; I am consuming more.  (Too much more, according to the waistband of my favorite pants.)  But my income is vastly higher than theirs in real terms, so that the food I consume is 10% of my household budget, rather than 50%.  Similarly, our descendents in 2100 giving over 40% of their income to health care (if indeed they do), will not be skimping on housing, transportation, clothing, entertainment, or what have you.  In all probability, they will be consuming more of everything than I do, except maybe energy and housing.  It's just that they'll be devoting a large share of their extra income to health care.  This prospect doesn't worry me.  And it probably won't worry them, other than the way it (mostly) worries us:  because we'd always like everything we consume to cost less, and be more equally distributed.

The healthcare social contract - The Atlantic,2615,"Rereading my column on healthcare from yesterday, I was unfair to one strand of progressive opposition to the Senate healthcare bill. The left has two main arguments. The first is that private insurance companies are such scoundrels that anything which puts business their way must be bad. On this view, the public option is the indispensable wedge that will eventually get private enterprise out of the business altogether. The second argument, to which progressives' attention has turned lately, concentrates on the mandate. This creates an obligation on government, they say, to ensure that good-quality affordable insurance is available. They say the Senate bill fails on this score. Again, the public option is the remedy, but the larger point is that the mandate is immoral if it forces people to buy ""junk"" insurance. I think the first argument, which opposes private health insurance on principle, is wrong. Yes, healthcare faces special problems: unregulated private enterprise won't do. But if competition in pursuit of profit is fundamentally wrong, as many progressives seem to think, you should not stop at healthcare. (Well, to be fair, many progressives don't stop there.) This platform is stupid politics as well. Deluded as they may be, Americans believe in competition and profits. Private health insurance is popular with the people who have it, as Obama recognised when he promised at the outset that nothing would change for those who were content with their existing arrangements. Progressives should come to terms with properly regulated private health insurance.It works fine in other countries.
 The second argument, though, is right. The mandate does have to be part of a social contract that makes insurance available and affordable. The Senate bill should certainly be criticised if it fails to pay sufficiently generous subsidies, or regulates the product carelessly (allowing companies to force bad policies on to their new captive market). That is a necessary debate about the right subject. Does the Senate bill meet the obligation to provide adequate, affordable insurance? I think it does. I give its subsidies and regulations pretty good marks. (See Jonathan Cohn at TNR.) Of course I can understand why progressives aren't satisfied--but I cannot understand how so many of them can see this bill as worse than nothing. That remains a mystery. No doubt the bill can be further improved. Any new system, once in place, will be continually tweaked in any case. Looking ahead, the mandate is good politics. It does create an obligation, and governments will not be able to shirk it.
